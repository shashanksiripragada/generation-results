Black box in your car
While the US road planners are struggling with the shortage of funds to improve the highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which is fitted with cleaning on your car's dashboard. .
This device, which tracks every mile carried out by the motor driver and transmits the information to the authorities, has now become the issue of a controversial effort for Washington and the State Planning Office to restore the old system to financing the major roads of America.
Generally, boiling work like highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
To keep details of the miles you drive, and perhaps the place you drive - and to utilize this information with the Libertorian Environmental Groups to support the government for allowing them to use these black boxes.
The tea party is very nice.
The US Civil Freedom Union is also very worried raising various types of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are searching for how they can go to such a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken black boxes for test drive, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is really a compulsory thing for our country.
"It is not a matter of being elected or not elected by us, it is to say that Hassan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, who has started tracking every mile fixed by motor operators in California by 2025. Is planning to start. "
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has become almost bankrupt, which is financed by the payment of taxes on the gas pump by American citizens.
American people do not buy as much gas as before.
Now in a gallon gas the car runs more than ever before.
There has been no increase in Federal Tax in the last 20 years, which is 18. 4 cent per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians avoid raising one penny in tax.
Lee Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, says, "Gas is not absolutely sensitive."
His state has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "It will work as the most logical option in the long run."
Wonks call it miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good to the urban liberals, because, for example, taxes can be changed to change the modalities of running a car, which can help reduce jam and reduce greenhouse gas.
The planners of California are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to fulfill the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Shuster (A-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendor in the Region Foundation is also in favor of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Policy in the Region, said, "It is not just doing what is going to the blind well.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who had favoured to proceed with the Congress in its report in 2011 towards per-mile payment.
The US Senate had sanctioned a 90-million test project last year, which included 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing such persons who have to walk a lot of miles to work daily or go to the city, the leadership of the House ended that proposal at the same time.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most interesting oragon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee to the state instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, including 17 State Transport Departments (including Meriland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support at all places.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, the driver was very impatient to think that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Alauddin Khan, who directed the strategic and performance management in Nevada Transport Department, says, "The concern about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem.
This is not something that people wanted.
With the advancement of the test, ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be very easy to convert these devices into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanaged technology infrastructure, which must be spread to keep every person's daily access record.
Nevada is one of the many states which is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles the car is running every day, but it is not where and when it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California Start-up called Tru Myles.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device which it is testing is good for the highway planners because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at the interval of time.
Ryan Morison, Chief Executive of True Miles, said, "If you do not track the speed and location of people, they will be more interested in adopting this method."
There have been some major mistakes in these preliminary programs of the state.
There are very few expensive and less interfering methods to do this.
In Oragon, planners are using to give different options to drivers.
They can choose a device of GPS or without GPS.
Or you can not choose any device again, but you can choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles set by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to the concerned citizens by providing more facilities rather than less in the device.
In New York City, Transport Officers are trying to develop a taxing device, which will also facilitate payment of parking meter fees, "Provide insurance according to their drive, and create a collection of actual time data from other drivers, which will be used to avoid motor-driven traffic. "
The city planning document mentions, "Moter-drivers will be attracted to participate due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussion on payment according to miles is a big deal.
In the San Francisco Gulf area, the Metropolitan Transport Commission has said that Congress can easily deal with the problem of the bankruptcy highway trust fund by increasing gas tax.
Additional one-time or annual fee can also be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars, whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their due share.
The commission's legislative and public affairs director, Randy Rentcheller said, "When Aspirin can work, then what is the need for radical surgery"
If we do this, then millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death has happened due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the departed goods with him.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Dariya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone is being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the inquiry that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of late ahid.
Ruhal went to Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the luggage on the edge, while the Ruhal went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhal searched for ahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that ahid was drowned.
Police told the court that ahid's death has happened due to drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Ruhal has been taken into custody under section 404 to hide the facts and the goods of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister 77-year-old Sylvio Berlusconi, who is known for Bunga-Bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very intelligence manner.
This is disclosed by his family friend Marthel Polanko.
According to him, Barlusconi, who has been the Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Franciska Pascal in his personal chapel.
Franciska's meeting with Balusconi was done when he was a teenage activist in the Forsa Italian party.
It is French, whose relationship was being said that his relationship with Balrusconi is merely a show.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Marthel Polanko has revealed that he was also invited to this intelligence marriage.
This ceremony has happened three weeks ago.
In the disclosure on Italian Radio2, when Polanko was asked that what would happen if both of them got married, Polanko has said that both of them are already married.
This was not a public function.
This marriage took place in the private chapel located in the former Prime Minister's house.
Apart from this, no one can tell anything.
However, he did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjode.
Both of them married about three weeks ago i.e. 8 or 9 October.
About 8 months ago, a 28-year-old woman, 50-year-old from her, was engaged to Franciska Pascal.
To avoid abduction, Berlusconi formed the basis of loneliness behind his decision.
In the lower areas, the rain continued to intervene between the eyes of the sun and Michauli.
Along with this, cold wave has started in the whole plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, minus -0.2 degrees in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
At the same time, due to rain and snow, strategically important Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed for traffic.
There is heavy snowfall on the Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of western disturbances, the rainy season started in snow and lower areas in the highlands of the plaintiff, which continued till late evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People are staying in the houses to avoid cold wave.
Meanwhile, power supply in many areas was also stalled.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail for sexual harassment, once again got disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a blood drinker of children, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news about Asaram and said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of showing news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to intervene in the matter, saying that they have more options.
Even before this, the court has rejected Asaram's demand for a ban on media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the case of the biggest TDS theft so far.
The group operator of the mall cut the TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it in the public exchequer.
By doing so, the TDS rupee was deposited with itself.
On October 17, the exploration team from Mumbai took action in collaboration with the Jaipur exploration team.
In the investigation of this link, it was found that this trader has cut TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started the income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of sealing the account was about 15 days ago, raids and surveys were conducted on this mall operator's group.
Angered by this action, the trader has clearly told the officials of the Income Tax Department that they are not ready to pay the TDS rupee to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them and doing action.
Officials investigating this matter have clarified that in case of non-payment, the recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
Given Deepawali, demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of poor and fake cattle increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against counterfeit sweets and chemicals.
The department seized 70 thousand rupees from Madhya Pradesh and 5 thousand glasses from uetta Colony.
With the demand for sweets increased in the market, the demand for poor maw from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department got information about bringing the poor Mave kept in dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Nagpur is being floated from the transport garage.
The department took possession of this cattle, which was valued at Rs 70 thousand.
Fear of action did not express any right to the matter.
The department destroyed it as an unclaimed property.
The department raided the Jitendra Caterers located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand glasses.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulphate was used to shine the spoon and stay for a long time.
Its sample will be sent to the laboratory.
Department's co-ordinator S. S. Deshmukh said that the campaign for chemical sweets and poor and counterfeiting will continue.
In the next few days, the information about this campaign and speeding up has been given by the department.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause poison.
The department asked sweet businessmen to make good milk, sweets from the flour.
An appeal has been made to the people on behalf of the Department to be cautious of fake sweets and sweets.
42 senior leaders of the state BJP received their vigorous reception at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come to Bihar for a visit to Santhana organized by the BJP.
The organization of Santhana Yatra is an exercise of sympathizing with the BJP for the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is notable that during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were seven blasts after one.
The intention of the terrorists of the Indian Mujahideen involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally, so that more and more people were casualties and there was panic in the state.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people died in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders have come out on a journey from Thursday by taking bones from their village.
On November 5, all those bones will be flown together in the Ganges in Patna.
Santana Yatra is organized as a part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of people killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, they will also provide a check of five to five rupees to the relatives of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
Encouraged by the burglary victory in the last match, when the Indian team will land in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will be to capture the series with victory.
India had to win Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series after the two ODIs were washed away due to the rain, and its batsmen gave a record victory while performing batting, so that the team matched 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest goal is also proving to be dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such a salute pair as Rohit and Shikhar, which is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while doing a great partnership in opening.
In the third place, Kohli has performed so far, he is considered to be the future Sachin Tendulkar.
Rather, many cricket pundits have termed him better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 years old next week, has set up 17 ODIs, out of which India has won 16.
Following the goal, their average is above 80.00 and has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were floping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open accounts in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as 'lifeline'.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have influenced everyone with his performance.
They are also demanding that they be taken in the test team for the domestic ash series against England.
Australia has good batsmen to the ninth number.
In addition to Bailey, Shen Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Fockner have made good bats in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aron Finch have not been able to leave any effect in opening.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling can be huge in Australia.
Johnson, who has performed well in the series so far, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashage series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this showing peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate terrorists near 2000 in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
After the failure of separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has become even worse.
Referring to the Pakistani tour of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI Chief Lieutenant General aheer ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's donor Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism will be aired in 2014.
Pakistan is busy fulfilling this promise seriously.
The killing of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for abolishing the army's privileges in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that such things are also anti-people till there is permanent peace in the state.
These give rise to anti-national elements.
He emphasized that the statements of the leaders, the morale of the security forces should be banned.
Snow Den ready to cooperate with Germany on American vigilance
Edward Snow Den, an American intelligence informer, has declared that the German parliament is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence if the US National Security Agency and its director Kith Alexander fail to respond to their activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle met Mr. Snow Den Seguruwar in Russia, where he has been given shelter to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter submitted by Mr. Snow Den to the media in Berlin on Friday, "Although the results of my efforts are certifiedly positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party change, and does not provide any rescue, which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with the allegations of felony. "
However, speaking the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include theft from the intelligence and the property of the government.
Hans Peter Friedrich, Minister of German Internal Affairs, told online exit: Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, then we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the US and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has bug the phone of Chancellor Angela Markel.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence. He said that if Mr. Snow Dan as a witness had the opportunity to cosunne, it should still be taken without ruining and endangering relations with the United States completely.
Mr. Straw Belle, a Green Party MP from Germany, published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their journey to Russia.
Mr. Belen said that according to the former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snow Dan is not able to return to Russia.
If Snow Den testifies in Germany, he will be safe there.
Mr. Snow Den said in his letter: "He had to face a fearless and sustainable campaign and he had to be forced to leave home.
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by widespread reactions to its work of surprising political expression.
Along with the United States - world citizens as well as high officials have underestimated the revelation of a responsibilities system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to collaborate with the German authorities When problems of human conditions have been solved .
Crontier Airlines will charge carriage - on baggage
Crontier Airlines plans to charge  100 for carriage-on-store luggage for passengers on its board.
Crontier Airlines plans to start a charge for 100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday it announced that the passengers can keep the entire box.
The new carriage - on duty is for the bag in the overhead bin, so the small bag under the seat will still be charged free.
Crontier said that  25 will charge if paid in advance, 100 will wait if the passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Crontier Spokesperson Kate O'Maily said that  100 fees are to be obtained to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid the passenger fees can do as much as they can stash in the overhead box in the carriage - on baggage , this means that there is often less space in this box .
There's a way to bring down for the passengers on the fee board.
O'Malie said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It's for the most loyal customers about therontier that finding the overhead bin is fast becoming difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets in their airline website do not have to give this.
This means that the next person in line may have to pay  100 for the same bag, while a passenger in line on a frontier gate can get a bag free.
O'Malie said that the procedures of Rontier's website and check-in are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Crontier's new carriage - on fees will not start until summer even though a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but the airline likes them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
The baggage fees on Wall Street are seen as a signal that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them don't even touch the carriage on bags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced Carry-on fee for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
With such a fee, the other airline is i Air of Hungary, who said airline advisor J Sorensen, and who tracks the ad-on fees.
He said that Spirit's carry-on duty brings 50 million in a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines official recently flew to Spirit and the passengers had to face carriage-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"It was easy to see the boarding process I saw in my airline carrier, he said.
I was hoping to piss my teeth and see a fight out at the gate.
"It was full of aviation and he offered it a lickety-split."
Crontier is also following C2 fees for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Crontier said that those travelers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and give it free coffee only for once.
It will still remove the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after seven months after the complaint of the passengers, they retreated and followed any other main airline after being there.
If the travelers of Crontier's do not purchase directly from the airline then this move of Crontier to charge charges on Carry-On is a fresh effort to operate customers towards their own website.
Airlines pays online travel vendor for this type of 10 to 25 for each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy them directly from those people rather than go through an online travel agency.
Crontier, however, has gone ahead in this area.
In September , many often flew halfway to the customers who bought from these persons from an online travel agency .
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award up to 25 percent of trip miles.
So, a 1000 miles longer trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It is also that they allow the only passengers to choose their seat in advance if they buy directly from the Drontier website.
Customers have a loyal base in their hometown in Denver, Crontier, but its business is decreasing and it's losing money.
Revenue has declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity has dropped by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. Wednesday.
Republic is trying to fix Rontier's finance as part of airline sales.
NSA blames "internal error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical shortage, our website was closed for a few hours, not because of hackers, as some people claimed online.
In an email statement, the intelligence agency said, "Today night NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours, which was due to the internal error during the pre-determined update.
This problem will be resolved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS].
In the evening, online server trackers had found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not accessible.
A spokesman for NSA told ABC News that "the agreement was not compromised" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hactivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website by DDOS attack.
DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity until the site is closed due to overloading the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively unregulated and the aim of attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the target system.
The events of a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programs in the past months have become the subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people, which have been collectively excluded by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, after the stolen and revelation of the NSA files secretly disappeared from the agency.
Due to such a growing controversy about the agency, after the incident tonight, there was speculation that this incident was the result of the targeted cyber operation.
Beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the 'One and Dronacharya' story showing harmony in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, in which fleets, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path.
The play was launched jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice President of the Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The drama showed the equivalence of the conditions of Dwapar era Dronacharya and presently a professor Arvind.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod restless, Hemant Goyal, Border Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a great presentation while doing full justice with the characters.
In the play, the lighting system was done by young colorful Jitendra C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were given to Apta's literary, cultural contributors.
In this, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and colorful Jitendra C. Raj were given.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to the executive officials in making the event successful.
Declining the profits of Bombardier as the delivery of the aircraft, declining orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter in its train unit and less on contract issues as pressure by aircraft order and delivery.
Montreal-based Bombardier also released any flight test data for its brand new Series aircraft or its ambitious program to go to commercial service from next September, did not present an update on the issues.
Approximately half a month before the first flight of the test aircraft, it's just blown up three times, whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result has fallen below the forecast and sent to the stock stock exchange for more than 8 percent sliding.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst share with the National Bank Financial, had reduced its rating for the field performance on Thursday, the stock is limited to the next one to two quarters.
"The strong aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transport," said Doresen in a client note.
We'll get a new order for Bombardier Series as progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, there is a doubt that the market program will be skeptical.
Bombardier hopes the airline family can now cut it off at the end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.

New research has shown that we work with full sincerity and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal on one side against the rule.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Access School of Business in UTA.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values while not having a stress in the morning, but in the evening, honesty decreases due to fatigue or excess pressure.
Researchers used two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right side.
The participants were told that if they give a wrong answer instead of the correct answer, they will be given money.
This experiment saw that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, during the use of people between 12 and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in mind.
With this, the researchers managed to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening, we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Prison of Cocaine lawyer who gave secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the notorious criminal Neil Scarboro
The advocate felt that people could find out about the addiction of his confidential drug
He was sentenced to three years in jail by the Liverpool Crown Court .
The defendant's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid that people will know about his secret addiction of drug, three years of imprisonment has been done.
42-year-old Barashat Ditta, after compromising his cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information to the notorious criminal Neil Scarboro about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities.
This advocate, who was named "Bash", and whose criminals were praised as "Top Brief", was arrested from his house in 2011 after the police supervision operation in Scarboro, which he had represented in the last Narcotics trial.
Officials saw 32-year-old Scarboro keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lankashire, while he went out with his colleagues for the Law Society dinner.
After getting cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, its wallet, and its credit card, it was found that Ditta A category was a "regulated user of drugs."
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarboro and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation of Heroin and Cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Mercedes, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons, who were sent to jail after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds during several impressions, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash.
42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because he feared that people did not know about the addiction of his cocaine.
After being found guilty in two cases of disrupting the path of justice after three weeks of trial in the Liverpool Crown Court, Ditta working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, Liverpool was facing disappointment in the Crown Court today.
He had accepted the cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started at the time when Scarboro was investigating, the police came to know that he was in regular contact with Ditta from February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping drugs with more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in Black Golf Glove.
After drug addiction, Scarboro was in regular contact with Ditta, who went out for dinner at the Blacknow Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that when the clue of A-class drug was found on Ditta's hair, buttocks and credit cards, it was found to be the "regulated user of cocaine" in the test.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use the cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and said that his discussion was "the subject of legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by removing his wallet, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office along with his workplace from his house, and his client used to call him at his house for legal matters.
After telling the arrested persons what the detectives knew about them, it was said in the court hearing that Ditta used to call the prominent people of the drug supply chain, some of which he had presented the case earlier.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said that "Criminal Advocate should know the best about not breaking the law."
Shri Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal advocate, joining a lot with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relation of the common drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his talks must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limit of attorney-client relationship.
As much as possible, he interrupted the investigation of the police so that they could be able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not honoring his profession but insulting him.
He made a lot of closer to certain clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed the agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that: "If I am a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and if I want to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I immediately do this work. "
But after the hearing, the superintendent of the Lankashire police Lee Halstad said that: At the same time, Mr. Dittta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself into a criminal advocate from a criminal advocate.
He made a great deal of agreement due to the addiction of his cocaine and weakened the objectives of leading members of organised crime groups who used it to obtain important information related to police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and believe in people and confidence.
Shri Ditta has deceived this belief and tried to avoid his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta in which he was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now disrupting the path of justice, which reflects our commitment to bring criminals to court.
This case should work as a warning to the criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present it before the court.
Scarboro was given 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fantasy job will be to become a lawyer for the death penalty client in America, his dinner guest of Mohammad Ali and inequality for his work. .

The topic of Mozambique ' s security concerns grows as a confrontation with powerful people .

The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo has been reported almost every day for two weeks, since more than 20 years before the peace agreement.
Ray Namo was once an infamous rebel of the movement supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and the Rangbhad government of South Africa as part of the efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that there is no possibility of returning to the country's full-developed struggle, but recent incidents have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The bets are high for the fast growing economy, some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Uni, for the discovery of the reserves and coal reserves of the North-East, may come from investments of more than  50bn next year.
The ruling Relimo Party blames each other for major political power, and Ray Namo tension since 1975.
Re Namo says that on October 17, the government started the latest struggle by launching an attack on its members in Sofa La province, a traditional Ray Namo Garh
With the attack on the former rebels and the resurgence, the government forces attacked the Renamo bases and told the Financial Times to try to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, Group leader, Fernando Majhang, Re Namo spokesman.
The government accuses the soldiers of attacking the soldiers and blames Ray Namo for the trigger.
President Armando Jibuzhan has sought to fool concerns about instability.
Mr . Jibuzhan told the AFP , the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr . Dhakama had seen himself as a slaughter , whoever he was trying to prove his forces , could implement his own decision on the government .
Both Free Limo and Re Namo insist that they want to avoid war .
Mr . Majhang was quoted as saying that the 1992 Peace Agreement had been abolished by Re Namo , but later became a matter of concern .
He told HTT that the agreement is not being honored by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back for negotiations, but seriously, Mr. Majhangne said.
The previous talks between the two sides did nothing special to reduce the tension of a series of conflicts this year.
"This is about two big men (Jibuzhan and Dhakama) fighting together, Yusuf Han said a lecture at the London Open University and a Mozambique expert."
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are ready to form concessions.
Ray Namo has been insisting on electoral reforms , which had already spoken of the boycott of municipal elections in November .
The President and Parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an attempt to win concessions from the government and a sick movement to win economic loot.
Re Namo's share in voting is declining since 1992, while a new party was created by a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Shri Majhang Mr. Jibuzhanko, who has left office at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want to leave Presidentship because he does not want peace, does not want a transparent election, Mr. Majhang said ..
What kind of capacity has not been clarified by Re Namo, but it has been done by the police stations and vehicles on a major north-eastern highway.
Most of the skirmishes are in the La province , several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo , with host Bira Port relying on exporting miners , coal including Rio Tinto and the valley .
After threatening to attack the Ray Namo line, in June, Rio suspended his experiment for nearly a week.
Whether Ray Namo would repeat the danger or not, Mr. Mazhangwineet was about to be asked.
Ray Namo Chije was not going well in Mozambique, who wanted to warn the international community, Shri Majhang said.
The government of instability increased the frustrations , the Fernando Leema , the Media Cop , which is the head of an independent media company , many are also concerned about corruption , slow pace of development and the recent floods of abductions .
"People are government and president to those responsible for the country's future, and it seems that they should be one to find solutions for problems," they say.
Omar Sultanate, a display, people still need stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads, they said.
Children should be taught as models for a way of "life writer", myths and legends.
Thor ' s stories could show no match for microscopic movements in cruel power , while the Arthurian legends show the significance of a dream .
In order to teach many of the myths, "It will not be appropriate to teach in the wild and in some cases even in the obscene and schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated "subordination selection" from one of the appropriate tasks of age.
"I think it's surprising, in America, myth and folk songs are already a part of the field of education," he said.
I'm advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called the authors and teachers more enlightening and this is a new turning point for children , as well as messages are being presented in entertaining stories .
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beovulf from Anglo Saxon, along with the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said, "Your intentions can be a lot but it will be better to keep it out of sight."
Probably a child requires some meanings of hope for a great difference between an adult writer and an adult writer.
Everything has to come for a simple or pleasant end , because it is a simple expression of good and evil .
And that should be submitted, but rather revealed through a story compared to it.
Not showing the old base.

Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Callson, former editor of the News of the World, has been accused that he used phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his relationship while being the Home Secretary of Charles Clark.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis C told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a misrepresentation in May 2005 that Clark was mixed with his "Accordant Special Advisor Hannah Polby".
It was said in the court that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Miller to hack Polby's voicemail and keep that male Nazar, but Callson also called and left his voicemail.

The investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer on which Ms. Polby and his sister were named "Project".
During the period in which they were being investigated, information was sought about Ms. Polby's grandfather by calling anonymously.
During this period, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbek and former Reporter James Weatherup witnessed the visit of Ms. Polby.
On June 18, 2005, through a voicemail, Callson told him: "I have got a story, which we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Adis said that the inclusion of Callson in this case is in the parton with other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blinket.
The Bench heard on Thursday that Callson talked to Mr. Blinket about the relationship with a married woman, while at that time he was watching the case of co-protester Rebekha Brooks, who was married at that time.
Callson and Brooks refused to do mischief with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200. to August 9, 2006.
Mulkyer, Thurlabek and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.

On the instructions of the Office (B) to protect the Constitution, Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US post, which is located at less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media asked B to express hope to identify the presence of Listening Antenna and indicated a exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper , director of American national intelligence , stressed that the United States should steal its foreign intelligence capabilities , steal trade secrets of foreign companies , enhance American companies ' international competitiveness or enhance the line below them . Then do not use it in September .
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made a whistleblower, the treasure of his revelations began to tell the American surveillance, the leaders of the European governments and the business world are no longer sure that the director does not follow his promise.
The U . S . National Security Agency spyed on Brazil ' s oil company , Petrobras , and our cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , and Yahoo , expressed their fear about state monitoring .
The last thing came when it came to know that the Chancellor Angela Markel was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be targeted, then surely the leaders of the business world are also making possible goals.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit .
"Germany should be awakened, Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost become a major risk like China, when it comes to stealing industrial espionage and data.
In all the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, there, however, there is no evidence that the US has to go to foreign companies' business revelations for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union and should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States .
The leaders of the business world are doubting about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
Hasso Platner, Chairman of the German business software company SAP, said, "This is no way."
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he did not have to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional, from coal to car, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The disclosures exposed by Snowden about American technical refinement and espionage reach have proved to be a trauma for some companies , who first believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China .
There is a major change in the cloud computing area where the European authorities are more aware that the data stored in the United States is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive .
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business institution, some 10 percent non-US members canceled the plan to use an American-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-chairman of the SAP, says: "We saw a new question which did not come to the customers a year ago - Where is my data stored" And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming whether they already knew: The powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore they should be guarded at all costs.
It is not a surprise that economic espionage happens.
It has always happened.
"This is a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed, Current Bock, Chemical Manufacturer BASE's Chief Executive.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do , because it is in national interest to defend our business .
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and it is an advantage for the attacker.
For big companies, message records have been going on for a long time, even if it is uncomfortable to leave a place in business from home, with a bus stick, or a laptop is uncomfortable leaving in a hotel room to at least say.
The members of the board of lrich Lackenberg, Car Manufacturer Audi, say that this is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening equipment.
Germany's FB executive when smart phones are compromising on foreign tours due to risks, it advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring, it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, many companies are the top in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secrets effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access.
The US has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the French the Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February is nominated in another tire of criminals involved in hacking for economic information behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when the matter comes to economic spying, French is the worst
Former head of the Bernard Surcini French Internal Intelligence Agency URI, in the interview, explains: "Services know very well that all the countries, even if they cooperate in non-terrorist battle, spy on their colleagues."
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do , because it is in national interest to defend our business .
No fool made.
"The parents of the teenager of Georgia, who died in an unknown accident, believe that his son was murdered
A teenager from Georgia, whose dead body was found wrapped in a restaurant mate in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, this was said by the family's advocate on Thursday.
Valdosta, K. K. K. Kendrick Johnson, was found trapped in the mate standing straight behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
The investigators of the Lands County Sheriff concluded that Johnson was dead in a "new accident", but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Corps, who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "He fully believes that his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in death in the manner told by Sheriff.
The sequence said that "He believes that this is beyond the logic of physical rules and general intelligence."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of his son.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag
US Advocate General Michael Mulre said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation about Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death
Did he be killed due to any crime
Murray said this at a press conference in the afternoon on Thursday.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring truth to the fore.
He said that "I think there is environmental reason for a formal investigation."
Moore told the reporter that initial body tests indicate that Johnson's death resulted in static respiratory respiratory.
According to Moore, in a second body test, there was a different reason for death.
He said that there are many questions which should be answered or confirmed.
Moore also said that if he gets enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, then he will ask FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not available immediately for comment from the office of the Londage County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, the Southern Georgian judge ordered the authorities to issue all the monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that the video footage will indicate how he died.
CDC releases allergic guidelines for children for schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines for controlling the food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time such guidelines have been issued by the US Government as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergy.
Now one in every 20 children in the US has food allergy.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, food allergies cases in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this guidelines, schools have been informed about how to inform teachers and employees about the food allergies of children, and in case of any allergic reaction, how to handle it.
Schools have also been suggested to keep an apnephrine stock to face potentially deadly anaphylaxis - an auto-engector of APPEN Brand, which is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can easily keep the stock of appenfrine in more quantity.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It seems that something is piercing in my tongue," It seems that my tongue is hair on my tongue, or "I am swinging in my tongue."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children ' s sex undetermined
Germany has become the first country in the European Union, which has recognized the third gender for children born with vague genitals.
Now the newborn children will not be specified in a conventional way.
According to the new law, parents do not have to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender "undetermined or "undefined" on the birth certificate of the child.
The objective of the new law is to reduce the pressure on the parents who can hasten the decisions related to gender-determination surgery for newborn children, and struggle against discrimination against Intersex children.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "No I am a man, no woman."
I will remain a wounded, stained posture made by the doctors.
According to estimates, every year one of the 2,000 children is such that there is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that comes under the scrutiny of gender development disorders, this is a collective term used for abnormal chromosome, genitals ( ovary or testicles), or abnormally developed sex.
Valis symposons may be intersex.
Gender identification is still not considered correct, but in the United States, most experts believe that when gender can not be determined, it is better to use the best information to specify the gender and to do surgery, if such a problem comes, inspect the psychological and physical development of the child.
Dr. Jack Dresser, psychologist of New York City, who is an expert in gender-information, said that the new law of Germany seems "good".
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state of vitality, for which surgery is needed, but this does not happen with most children."
You can specify the sex without surgery, and after that see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child, is not very accurate.
No person can answer properly about this why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle that why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, Intersex has been described as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their position is not related to gender, but related to its biological composition, which is neither explicitly male nor female, but either jointly or neither of them is clearly defined.
These features can display themselves in secondary gender characteristics such as weight of muscles, distribution of hair, breast and length in primary sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals or chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination in the field of jobs by Intersex and Transgender individuals as well as harassment, violence and partisan crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-corresponding sex.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark men, women or third sex on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norri Me-Welby became the world's first recognized sexless person after winning a legal appeal to maintain "unspecified sex status" for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in addition to M or F in the German passport, there will be third specification for intersex persons as .
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw gender principles from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany saying, "When the world is going to such a state where the gender itself is an option, but not a sexual act, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction. "
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn baby also told the baby zone that she would like to see the children being specified at birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, "The upbringing is very stressful without extra boundaries, especially if you do not even know what your child's gender is.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called Hermaphrodites (Ubhilingi), which was named after the beautiful Greek deity, who were bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered Linga as a slate, which was erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the morality of surgery, they understand that gender-first is a complicated work, and sometimes there can be a mistake with physicians, who do not know that when the children grow up, what will they feel about their sex determination
The dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Mano disease emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The present theory about the treatment of children with vague genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of the University of John Hapkins, who considered sex to be sophisticated.
He composed the sex identification word and argued that social and environmental signals - how parents raise the child - interact with the gene and hormones of the child to be recognized as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as "Jonzoan", their principles became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose gender was accidentally sexed during circulation that they should complete the child and remove his testicles and do it like a girl.
The dresser said, "Money presented that case as a successful case of postponement, but it did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child replaced himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following the same pattern.
But in the years after 1990, with the arrival of the Internet, people passing through these sex surgery started coming out, "It is not happy with the consequences."
The same case was with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with .. male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Doctors did not clearly understand that their penis was small, or its fugitive was big, but they were sure that they could never live a "clean life" as a man.
Therefore, after some time of his birth in 1976, the external organs of the bruce and ovary were removed by surgery and her upbringing was done like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl.
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was going to have vaginoplasty with him.
But feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the terrible truth.
I was bound at the time of birth - and no one told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, he took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
She became barren due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people about intersex persons in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
However, the legal group of California-based Advocates for Informed Choice Executive Director Annie Tamar-Matis expressed concern that Germany's law invites "Chippie" and stigma.
She says, "It seems to the activists that the law of Germany will motivate parents to make quick decisions and to "determinate" the child.
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We feel that it is a better process to specify male or female sex rather than waiting.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Matis said that his organization supports Australian law because it allows adults to be identified in third gender.
He said, "Adults should be able to make their own decision about the legal sex."
Germany's law is related to specifying it at birth.
This is not the war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburg's breast radiologist Dr. Erlean Baratz, whose daughter is a sexual development disorder, and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that Germany's law will provide strength to both parents and children.
Baratzi's daughter Kati was born with male chromosomes, but she was a DSD called full endrogen insensitivity synthesis.
Since there was a fault in his endrogen gravity, women's character developed in Katie.
There is a vagina in his body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at Pennsylvania University.
Although he is inferior, but he hopes to adopt or become a mother through a Gastational Surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents not to make any decision on their own in haste."
It gives them understanding and time properly by some tests before writing a man or woman.
In this way, you are fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a dear child and enjoy it.
We do not need to do such surgery in haste, which can not be returned.
He said, "It brings children in the process of decision making and frees parents from the mischief that motivates parents because they do not believe that they are doing well."
Finally, the child will determine which gender she is more comfortable - and this will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

In which students and others were given information about the right to education and law for economically backward people.

The most remarkable explosion in the revelation is that Mark Halperine and John Helemon's hugely expected 2012 campaign Tom, Double Down: Change the game 2012.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and told Thursday evening that the top advisers of the President, "Worker Group-Satresses and in order to organize polling in late 2011, what dumping Biden can help in Obama's falling hope of elections. .

Potential switch was a very safe secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office .
The change of former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlorod and David Paloufe, including only half a dozen President's close advisories, was under consideration.
Down claims that Daley tried to change Biden , although his personal synergy , ultimately , before he decided , that Clinton ' s ticket would not improve Obama ' s situation .
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I kept the whole scene in mind, and one of them, it was said to the newspaper.
You remember that at that time the presidential post was in danger, so we were in such a situation, "What else would we do"
While casting research as a precaution, Martin had told ENC's Anderson Cooper that again the election campaign made important investments, how much the dividend will be given to this claim in finding this.
 Campaign does not spend on voting and focused groups like money till they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, did Obama know that his team is looking for changes.
Martin told CNN that he asked him if his boss knew about possible reshuffle
While Dare said that he did not think the president knew about possible changes , the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was possible that Obama knew it .
"Will Down certainly not answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk" Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought about Obama Biden Dumping Ticket Research.
"Probably, Martin said.
Glo-in-the-Dark ice cream likes
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first Glo-in-the-Dark Ice Cream - using jailifish.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of advantage of marine animals to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came after reading a research paper on Jelfish and Chinese reliable scientists used chemical brightness to revive the protein.
Ice cream will increase the PH level of protein by responding to the tongue of the eater and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream reacts with the heat of the mouth , i . e . it will be as bright as it is to win .
Charlie, founder of Like MIM Dalisius Icecream Company, said, "This is unbelievable, but the initial days of production will get around 000 to 000 grams of goods.
The protein we're using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the PH level and the ice cream will shine.
We have been experimenting for the past few months and seeming to be absolutely right to share it on the heloven because it gives a wonderful shining effect
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream that makes mane , because the glow of the jelly fish is four times more expensive than gold .
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds .
Although Diska taste is very good.
Lapne is famous for abnormal taste, including experimental company, beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf based in Charlie's Bristol.
But his next composition is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.
It is naturally impossible that due to the ice crystal, which makes a refraction over the ice cream, but I think we will get a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of reflective properties of a jailifish synthesized by Chinese scientists

George Keren : Euro disintegration gave Scotts the option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join the entire Europe as an independent travel area as a condition of membership of the EU.
Passport control on Barvik and indicate stories about the boundary of thorny wire on the walls of the headrian.
It is true that the Strathclide Paper describes the potential economic benefits of free traffic with the rest of Europe, although it has not been described in the headlines forecast.
Nor did anyone describe that the EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a swing area, Brussels will actually be cheap for continuous non-compliance brussels in exchange for getting whatever he wants from Scotland.
So, then, non-what
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has been frozen. First of all, I had heard about 40 years ago, "Independence means Passport Control.
Yet the interesting point was lost in reciting this interesting old story.
Anyway, why should we expect to bid Europe from independent Scotland
Why London's Yok should be purchased for Brussels, especially now
There is real European news: The great, war-style plan to organise Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Dedicated teams are strengthening the entire EU to oppose EUs or to shut down Euro as a uniform currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptile Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly came and obtained nearly fifty lakh votes in the federal elections in September, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dams) from the bundestag.
The plan to build federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical change.
With the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone very far due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
The Euro crisis did not have much role in the high budget deficit of the national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system stabilized its members the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in the underlying loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salaries and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Deep European productivity is far beyond the current budget and currency problems.
In order to exempt French and German energy firms on consumer expenditure - as a result of the "Green Energy Policies" imposed by Brussels, the European Industry doubles for power and four times for gas as compared to the United Nations.
This is a paralyzing cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even to freeze all salaries in the world, the European petrochemicals industry can not avoid being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, there is a sense of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once the main fan of the EU.
After the war, the top French politicians had seen the EU as a measure to control Germany, and to provide Paris equal billing to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the economy of France is staggering.
Consequently, the right wing of Marine Lee Pen, the anti-EU National Front, has won the victory by pushing the ruling socialist in third place in the recent by-election.
At present, the front in France is the most popular party with 24 percent of the vote - it is a warning to the British Labor that they can not assume that disintegration for the left will be automatically benefited for the right.
What is Lee Pen doing with his new fame in the middle of the French Goras, the working class
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to create an anti-EU and anti-Muslim faction in the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is: soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-substantial sentiment in Europe will end the Euro.
The euro will not be completely eliminated, but this retailer will be able to return to the CD (supreme) nations in any form like Europe, which will be supported by General De Gaulle.
Germany and some of its resilient economies can maintain the Euro, but France and South Europe will resume their currency.
I hope that the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing proximity with the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (essentially).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-unional nations to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic independence while following the path of Norway.
The SNP Government in Scotland has been the most successful anti-imperialist political campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dam alliance, opposed the cuts proposed by Labour Chancellor Elitaire Darling and thereafter.
It will be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of fiscality imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Youth before time: getting bigger quickly
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get young age in comparison to their old girls.
Physical change does not mean that the youth is near .
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of youth at a young age.
The case of youth before time is not as effective in boys .
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheriz is an expert journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts at the age of 7 or 8 and the hair of the genitals begins
This week at the annual conference of the American Pediatric Academy at Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, a pediatric and chronicologist, clarified that these early physical changes are common in American girls, these new trends show.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time in reassuring parents - generally it does not show rapid progress towards full youth."
Direct symptoms of development such as breast sprouting, genitals and glass hair and physical smell are seen prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first monthly religion).
In United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
When the breasts start developing then it takes at least two to three years to take place in the first ropeway , which is also the author of premature youth in the girls : the guide to deal with this common problem .
The most accurate test time for the development of youth is time.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of youth, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, it is called "Bal-Adult".
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - whose child doctors can closely inspect.
In case of more rapid progress, an endocrineologist may need to investigate so that the possibility of serious problems like tumors or cyst can be overcome.
Treatments for delaying premature menstrual cycle and other consequences: premature age of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and dramatic stature as adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are aware of medicines but accept, "Depressing youth can increase practical issues, and girls can feel different from their colleagues."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their young daughter to be monthly.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock.
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and returned to trouble that in his friends, he first started monthly religion.
There are many well-known principles about the causes of untimely youth.
Nevertheless, there is no continuous evidence that hormones in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment or sex-oriented messages in the media can be accused.
Boys - Like girls, they are getting premature youth.
Caplovitz determines the rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting a study over girls of 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects the body fat with the time of youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get youth before their age-girl girls.
There are many explanations of this.
At the global level, the pattern of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Although the boys are getting the hair of face and genitals at an early age, but the trend of full youth is not as clear as the girls in them.
Other physicians present at the AAP Conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see hair of fun and genitals.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child physician, Andocrinologist, at the Goraib Children's Hospital in Mauritius Town, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about how we recognize the real beginning of the youth. "
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It may mean to negotiate before the expected time."
If you remain calm then your child will normally answer properly.
Girls developing prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.

Big orders of jet manufacturers at stake with controversy for seat width .
This month's Dubai Arsho has got a race setting up a rhythm for a quarrel between leading aircraft manufacturers for width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights
The controversy is focused on the width of the Economy class seat in long flight aircraft, not always like being given by the airlines, but whose allotted location is efficiently claimed to be the key by the late Jet Airbus SAS and the Boeing Company..
Arbus gives a detailed seat of at least 18 inches -LRB- cm -RRB- in the Economy Cubin this week but it should be decided by the airlines its main rival Boeing says .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when after the incident of 17-21, there was a competition to sell the big version of the twin engine of the long distance Ercraft from the possible recorded order.
How the previous department of the aircraft has been made - in particular, whether the designs of mini zambo jets are being prepared keeping in mind the claims of seating 9 or 10 are equal
According to Boeing , it is made 777  which will keep 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 in one line in anonymous department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will take 350 people out of 18 inches and take them to 9 seats.
Airplanes often strike business on technical matters through advertising in the business press .
Now, with Airbus 777, Dubai Arsho is expected to dominate more than 100 orders, it is appealing to the public further.
It is being seen recently that whatever the beginning of the separation war has been, will you accept it together in a restaurant showing this to Finsero
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "Boeing is also presenting a long distance flight to regional turbos."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way to sit on the plane is not changed.
According to the US Health Department data, during the 1970s, when Boeing 747 Jambo One defined the modern long-term ki yatra ki ta ta , and the average weight of the centuries was 40-49-year-old American male weighing me 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says that its rival is sticking to a 1950 seat concept when the new name Jet Set ' s average periphery was narrow .
Airbus says that he has set up a research commission, which suggests an additional inch of 53 per cent improvement in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the seat measurement data of the Airbus , and said that it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers as to how airlines become a balance between rent and facilities .
It also says that research shows that the width of one seat depends on the experience of cabin more than the width.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Crawer said that in reality it tells what is the need to do to give flexibility to the airlines and on those things which are confident that they need to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they benefit from.
They know better about their business than someone else.
This is about the elbow room for the flyers, but for the suppliers it is an issue faster that it can affect the income.
Behind this dispute, the trade of at least  700 billion is estimated, in the coming decades, the competition of the aircraft order is sufficient to tap the American and European exports.
The Report of the Reuters said for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually a matter of fighting between new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 per cent of the workforce has been done in the new twin engine design, compared to the leader of that section, 365-seat Boeing 777-300 errors.
The claim of Boeing ' s performance depends on comparison with 777 designs of 10 with 777 x one origin 9 .
10 equivalents with profits in unit cost now have been used.
Head of Airbus Passenger Facilitation in Kevin Keniston, Europe says, "This is the Boeing flight to capture more seats to make our products more competitive."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat per row cabin suggests for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the dancing layout, which can go along with cheap rent ..
My kerby, founder and editor runway girl network said that the seat width of eighteen inches will be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of 777
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to select suppliers for airlines.
Jet vendors around the world also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
While resting too much, all builders are also providing high density layouts for low-cost airlines of jets and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus stressed on some of its jets in comprehensive cabin seats to need more cabin facility.
Without the support of another manufacturer of modern jets, there is no possibility of flying on a new industry standard but it can distract from the wave of 777  sale.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can enjoy smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate fun from smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was able to keep rats safe from the addiction of nicotine for the whole life.
There is a need for further testing before the start of the test on man, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that initial signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectly infects the liver cell, which after that starts making a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents them from getting the summons of nicotine inside the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine given rats who were later given nicotine continued to do their normal activity.
Researchers say that but the rat who was not given the vaccine was "good", it was an indication that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
There was a dose to be given at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver cell will make the factory of antibody.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, then it can be given to the children before the greed of trying cigarettes, so that they can be saved from the addiction of nicotine.
But it will probably be used to quit smoking by smokers.
He said, "He will know that if he starts smoking again, he will not get any pleasure from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help him get rid of his habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to be researched a lot.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not arise due to the actual cause of the death of the tigress.
The Forest Department is giving a round reply to the death of the tigress in the first place as natural.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar Forest Division got the body of a tigress near the Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi Nallah.
With all the organs of the body of the tigress being safe, there was no sign of any wound or injury etc.
On Friday, the post-mortem of the body of the tigress was done by forest patron Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kaksha Nasim, SDO GS Karki, Veterinary doctor Bharat of CTR and veterinary doctor Hema Rathore of Kotabagh.
According to sources, during the post-mortem, the internal body of the tigress is being told to be bad.
This did not detect the reasons for the actual death of the tigress.
On the death of the tigress, the departmental officials continued to respond.
Nevertheless, the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for hatsicological examination to confirm the poison.
Forest Guard Western Circuit Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tiger can be said to be natural.
No symptoms of poison etc. have been found from the body of the tiger.
Nevertheless, with the search of the surrounding area, the Bisra investigation is being sent to confirm the poison.
We deny being influenced by Tripodi Obide.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe A Tripodi will be examined by State Corpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe A Tripodi has refused to refute the policy of maritime leases on the request of his political guru AD Obide, the patron of former New South Wales, who had hidden interest in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission (ICA) on Friday examined whether Mr. Obide violated the circulars of lobbying with several State Ministers where two Obide-owned restaurants and cafes were renewed without tender after its expiry in August 2005.
Lin Ashpole, after the evidence given by the former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, knew the hidden interests of Mr. Tripodi Shri Obide.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the public tender for the lease.
The leaseholders were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, circular enterprises for lease, from which Obide earned  2.5 million annually, renewed without lease tender.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of public tender.
But he refused to change Mr . Obide ' s request , Mr . Tripodi had urged for a change in government lease policy .
Shri Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dun, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries, Obide in August and September 2007 after working in the Ministry of Ports.
The Assistant Commissioner, Anthony Haley, asked Mr. Tripodi. Was the commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case
No, Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can not remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say Israeli fighters attacked Syria .
Israeli fighter aircraft targeted Latakia on Thursday night in Syria ' s port city , a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News .
The officer did not tell what the motive was, but there was at least one motive.
The report of the Associated Press tells that the target Russian missile was SA-125 .
Israel has attacked the missiles inside Syria at least twice before this year.
Foreign employees can undergo ' authenticity test ' on 457 visas
The Government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign employees on 457 visas as it aims to expand a harsh action.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criteria framed to prevent 457 used for filling unskilled posts in Australia or for delivery of family and friends in a secret manner.
A Government Discussion Paper was issued today, condemning the government's words about foreign employees, former Labor MP Maxine McCu said today that it can enrage neighboring countries of Australia.
He told the US India Institute today that "Foreign people are reaching the end of the queue and "Australian people have a very unpleasant repetition at a time when the unions have a safe labor market Demanded. "
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been provided security - and I would not be surprised if some people in the region have witnessed the sound of that historic evidence.
The Discussion Paper shows the outline of 12 measures which were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Boven.
Immigration Minister Brendan Okoner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met the officials about the smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the remaining are under consideration.
"If the authenticity norm is adopted, then the visa applicant can be examined in this regard whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the person nominated, the owner of the person sponsoring the visa or the person belonging to the affiliated person or personal partner is. "
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, because the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees, has employed hundreds of people.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died due to heart attack after a refugee boat arrived on Christmas Iceland this week.
The nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, an adult cousin has tied the dharna, which was on the same vessel.
Australian officials transported the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of Scotland from the US2 rail project.
Work by US2 indicates high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Cremer said that this project will be "Britain One".
Scotland Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
In the first phase, the new high speed rail line will be included between London and West Midlands.
On completion of the second phase, lines will reach Manchester and Leaders.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high speed link between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British government, which was interacting with Scotland Transport, instructed US2 Limited to consider the possibility of improving rail capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
It includes the possibility of reducing travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
According to Barones Cremer: Our goal for US2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with US2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburg, which will be well added due to US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elitaire Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for a clear return to Scotland in the US2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "There is a possibility of Scotland getting huge economic benefits from the high speed rail, but this will increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high speed rail across the UK.
Therefore, we are excited to work in the participation of the British Government so that we can examine the options to bring high speed rail in Scotland, generate profit for all and meet the Glasgow-Adinburg line, whose Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the ministers of the British Government next year and take a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Device Rules will now be effective in Australia
In response to the move to soften the equipment regulations in the US, Australian air travelers will have to continue to shut down their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to American Air Services Companies to change their procedures, so that during the important phases of the flight, passengers will be able to read e-books, watch video or play games on their equipment, provided they are in the tool "Civil Mode".
Passengers can do this only during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-book etc. while landing.
Australian Air Services Companies are considering this decision, according to which US Air Services Companies will have to do a lot of work to fulfill this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of power equipment in important phases of flight are still effective in Australia.
"There is no specific regulation to control the use of power equipment in the aircraft," the authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operating companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the security instructions given by the crew members. "
Virgin, who is already negotiating with the CASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he has taken further action on the instructions of the regulator. Asked to
The spokesman said, "We will welcome the review by the FASA in the matter of allowing the use of power equipment, because we really feel that it will provide better experience to the customers, because now we have (Wireless in-flight entertainment) is in our planes. "
uantas said that it will now follow the current rules.
It said that according to our current policy, power equipment can not be used while flying and landing the aircraft, and we do not have any immediate plan to change it.
LDAA decisions apply to American allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will definitely consider the reasons behind the CAAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Air Service Companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio variation from mobile devices, as well as amend their rules books, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and brief descriptions to the passengers.
The LDAA said that after verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow the passengers to hand over all the heights, light weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to stop their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper coaches while flying and landing.
Ponbrokers silver due to difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
In Ponshop in Bendemier Shopping Centre in Singapore, the mother Amirthalinga is taking cash by paying her gold bangles, rings and swings to pay her daughter's school fees.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have bought the house recently, so all our money is trapped in it."
She says that, although she earns  3,000 Singapore dollars (US2,400) as Administrator, and her husband also works, but the monthly income of the family remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in the parts of South-East Asia where domestic credit is increasing - Valueex where they are doing their transactions became the third ponshop to be listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Ornament pledge is not the only way to obtain cash - Ms. Amirthalinga is  1,300 Singapore dollars, but almost as cheap as the unsafe bank loan.
Normally, in Singapore, the ponbrokers take 17 per cent per annum, which is only a little more than 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender who has a branch in the same shopping center.
However, the ponbrokers do not have the benefit of checking credit or proof of salary, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are turning to Ponshop due to rising costs of life and increase in domestic and consumer loans by families.
After five years of global financial disaster, and after cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in the developed economies, low and middle income families are approaching Ponshop to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standards Ang Puerce, described the growing domestic gains due to the increasing mortgage, as a risk factor for the liability of Asian banks.
It said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP.
Malaysia ranks supreme in this list with 80 percent of GDP, compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are worried about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from the technology recession this week.
On Thursday, the data has shown a continuous recession and reduction in consumer demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, CIMB, economist Song Seng Woon said, "The decisive point is that with rising prices, [in the middle class] people coming from the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way. .
In the last two years, in the values of gold, historically high values have inspired people to mortgage individual property because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family's ornaments.
70 percent of the items mortgaged in 200 pon outlets of City-State in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The price of sleeping is good, let's pledge the gold chain of grandmother's mother, and withdraw the next month."
Thailand's largest ponshop operator, Ezimani, has seen a 20 increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the mortgage business that in Bendimer, Outlet operator Valuemax and 15 others like this in Singapore are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, in Malaysia, where there are four shops, but also outside Asia Are planning to expand, the executive director of Valuemax Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it with a 60 percent use of 66 million Singapore dollars in the listing this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms.
She says, customers pledge things that they already have, and redeeming personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
Social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weak people use ponbrokers.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use Valuemax Outlet, they pledge gold bars or rollex watches, which can get cash payment up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
Ms. Yah says, "They include wealthy persons who need loans for a short time for business enterprise or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
Mukesh Ambani, India's largest businessman, is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday in Mumbai but not in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.
Many Bollywood stars reached Jodhpur to attend this party. On the evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur flight at Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife poetry Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously when such a big name is included in the party, you can guess how big this water will be.
325 million rescue package for Tagy's health
The Union Government has stressed that strict conditions are also associated with the  325 million rescue package for the health system of Tasmania, which will ensure that the state government can not waste the fund.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking immediate action to resolve the current crisis due to the old population of the state, the high rate of chronic diseases, and the boundaries of the system.
The decision to financing during the four years was made after consultation with the Government of Tasmania with Independent MP Andrew Wilki.
Ms. Plebersek said today, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the special challenges faced by the state.
The package of  325 million includes an alternative  31 million surgery plan.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous aggregated cases.
It also includes Walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lonsestation, better care after going to the hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health recording system in local hospitals.
These investments are in line with the best ways I have been told by leading physicians to improve the health system of Tasmania, Ms. Plebersek said.
The Minister emphasized that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability rule.
The state will have to maintain the current financing level to get Commonwealth funds, and report every month where the additional fund is being spent.
A Commission of three members will be constituted to ensure that the state provides services as effective and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that the meaning of 325 million will not be very high until real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level.
Yet, he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he had first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
Mr. Wilkie said, "I hope the federal aid package will prove to be very helpful in separating the state-run public health system from the crisis-hit list."
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will primarily refrain from the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Datton believes that today's announcement is "band-ed solution".
He told ABC TV, "We are here because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system."
You cannot consider taking about half billion dollars by the state government and giving 300 million dollars by the Commonwealth as a good news day.
Shri Dutton demanded that Ms. Plebersec should be guaranteed that one dollar of the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons capability .
The group monitoring on Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to create chemical weapons and toxic gas war material, while a fierce conflict emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war that started almost three years ago.
This announcement of chemical weapons prohibition organization was made one day before the last date of 1 November .
The Hague-based organization had fixed Dumscus to add chemicals to all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to destroy or make the machinery used for filling in war materials.
The main completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development, aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of dums by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
It is believed that Syria now has 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, which includes Mustard Gas and Norway Agent Sarin.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when there was an increase in conflict in Safira city on Thursday, about which experts believe that it is a center of chemical weapons production and also a collection center.
The movement group, which has described the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this, 61,067 civilians including 6,365 children are included.
On behalf of the government it has been said that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military army, 18,678 are fighters in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah is a militant.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's military team continued to fight rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people have been casualties on both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war reflects the danger faced by the inspectors of chemical weapons, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short time frame.
In a statement to the OPCW, who worked closely with the United Nations, it was stated that its team is "now satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all the declared important production and mixing equipment in Syria as destructive.
It also said, "No inspection activity is being planned next."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centers declared by Dumscus.
Inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been tortured and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of the two centers where OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
I salute the determination and courage shown by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission made by this organization.
This home war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly a conflict between the government of Assad and its security forces, which includes members of the Shiite cult, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in the Air Defense Center in Latakia, the coastal region of Syria.
He said that the reason for this explosion is not known yet.
Police have recovered photographs of fake registry, fake seals, laptops and fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar's Office (East) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused registrar along with the clerk and recordkeeper of the office, Balbir Singh used to get out of the records of empty and old land and after that he bought a new stamp paper and prepared a fake registry on them.
Not only that, after disappearing the real registry, they used to offer fake registry records.
After this, the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on fake papers.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this the real owner of the land was pushed to the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the fake registry kept a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the fake registry of those lands.
Police commissioner Gill said that the accused told in the interrogation that they have so far prepared fake registries of 150.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft are already registered against gangster Rajiv.
Indignation over the conviction of the bomb blast in Bali
Families and relatives of 202 people killed in the bomb blast in 2002, expressing resentment over the punishment given to the conspirator of the bomb blast, said that Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran away as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in manufacturing explosive devices used in the bomb blast.
When parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other charges related to terrorism, which included a series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that this person, who is called the infamous "discriminatory person" as the master of the bomb, be the death penalty.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of Jun Cartein, a woman living in Perth, who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughter in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told AAP, "They should be put in front of the firing team."
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
On October 12, 2002, at 11 o'clock in the night, after the bomb blast loaded in the van parked outside all the clubs, the nomination of this club was erased.
Peter Hughes was in the Padies Bar just 20 seconds before the explosion of a bagpack filled with explosive material by suicide bombers.
They went to the coma for a month as a result of the bomb blast and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Shri Hughes says that Patek should have been punished only by three other members of the Jemmah Islamiah terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given death penalty before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get 20 years of punishment.
Patek is the last person to be punished from Bali bomb blasts.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but ultimately in January 2011, he was arrested in Abatabad, Pakistan, where the US Army had killed former al-aeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted the evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an effort to re-establish contacts between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, it is not really the sadness of bringing so many people mental pain.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "This year many tears will flow.
Still Patek can appeal against his penalties.
FAA: Air travelers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but cell phones can not call)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to enter the gate from the gate to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but will not be able to talk to their cellphone - Such a federal aviation administration on Thursday is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the administration.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show how their aircraft fulfil the new guidelines and how they are updating the rules for collecting training booklets and devices of their crew members to show the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already obtained schemes from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and Jetblu are from those airlines who have already submitted plans.
FAA said in a statement, "Based on the plan situation, we can approve the extended use of electronic device very quickly.
At present, passengers need to shut down their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and do not start them till the Captain is allowed.
Passengers are expected to stop their devices again while landing on the plane, and do not start it until the plane is completely descended.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interruption can allow their passengers to fly by aircraft, aircraft while landing and use the device at the time of taxiing, said FAA.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at a higher altitude, they are expected to fulfill these norms.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airline companies to do this - then it will be a victory for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we are bored by feeling like "hole monitors".
The agency said that but it will still be restricted to connect internet at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, exchange emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
There will still be no conversation with friends, a game like online scrabble, the famous incident related to which is that when actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while parking at the gate in 2011, and the American Airlines had dropped him off the plane when he refused to stop the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected because due to their jumping, the other person will be worried about injury in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
Regulatory rights related to phone calls are with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
FAA can lift restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and landing the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosen of the National Transport Security Board, who is a national transport security expert of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered risky.
Rosenkar said, "Sail phones are really serious issues, not because they can potentially interfere in navigation-related devices, but also because they can create disruptions in cell phone towers when they are in the air. "
In order to investigate the issue, the Industry Advisory Committee constituted by FAA has recommended last month that the government should allow more use of individual electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce the ban on their use.
Critics like Sen. Claire McCascalk, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for prohibition.
It is becoming even more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is omnipresent.
Some studies also indicate that about three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to shut down their device.
FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996 when the passengers received reports of disruption in navigation and communication equipment due to carrying FM radio and high-tech gadgets at that time.
New airlines companies are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic intervention.
The airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at the cruise height for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interruption.
Hurta said that most airline companies should meet the eligibility norms for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic device emits very little power radio transmission compared to the previous generation's electronic device.
For example, e-readers, there is absolutely nominal transmission during the page reversal.
But transmissions are strong when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been among those who have favored reducing the restrictions on the use of the device by the passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks used by the device.
The Douglas Kid of the National Aviation Passenger Association said that he believes that the interruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are reports only described by the pilot in support of interference by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot should allow the passengers to shut down the device at the time of landing in less visibility.
The Group of Travel Industries has welcomed the changes and called them the common knowledge facility of people travelling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Do, CEO, US Travel Association said that we are happy that FA has recognized that travelers travelling with joy are not incompatible with rescue and security.

Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain
The Business for Britain was launched in April and it was pledged to bring business together and to determine what changes we want to see with the UKs employment and prosperity manufacturers.
For this, we organized the largest and most detailed survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders who are representatives of UK business size, regions and locations.
The conclusions of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of the businessmen now wants to export out of Europe, and wants to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU members are becoming dynamic.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not to remain involved in the long-term and miserable process of improving the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
General dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is more than the benefits of becoming part of the business sector of Europe - even the huge businessman who traditionally favored European companies, 40 percent of them agreed on this.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants Britain to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
The findings, which were seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are motivating a "sufficient change" that would give back its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - the issue of Treaty Transformation for the UK and a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of sustaining the EU in the fray.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: the Survey says that British businessmen support his plan to negotiate on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to make a meaningful transformation and revive the present power balance in favour of UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming compulsory at a very fast pace because the Eurozone is moving forward in the direction of the affiliated economy and the fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey concludes that for businesses it means a new focused focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulation process of Brussels.
Alexi Miller of Gazprom calls the pipeline a new round in Bulgaria .

Before the allegations against Jonathan Lord, two employees of YMCA accused of sexual offenses, the Royal Commission heard
Before being accused of caringbah child care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offenses.
But in his statement before the commission, he said that "It never came to the notice of child sexual harassment within its organization, it was told to the commission."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCCA was accused of child pornography offenses, and another case in which YMCA Caringbah Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual offenses against children living in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to the advocate GAIL Fernness who assisted the commission, he knew about the matter first, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that outsiders of YMCA have been examined and they have found YMCA at the forefront of child safety.
It is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Department uality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Green, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that due to the appointment of the Lord, the management itself has failed, and failed to ensure that the employees are clearly aware of their obligations regarding information on child safety policy violations.
In the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted for sexual offenses with 12 children during a two-year tenure in YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not report the violation of child protection by the Lord.
Whatever the employees saw about the violation, gave to the evidence that Lord spent time alone with the children, personally babiesizing them, putting them in the lap, telling them that he loves them and playing them on their mobile phones Includes playing.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of the Lord, had said for child safety training, as he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the YMCA caringbah child service manager Jacoby Barnat, who supervised the Lord, was very threatening and difficult to get most of the time.
The CEO said that it did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable giving information above their manager.
He said that, but his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his view to the YMCA NSW Mandal that, "Jonathan was about not giving the text "information" to the organization from the Lord incident.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the privacy agreement by the employees immediately after the charges came to light, the child service of the YMCA was done by the General Manager Lium Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the combination of evidence, but it was not executed excessively and correctly.
Stephen Smallbon, Special Professor of Child Sexual Abuse of Griffith University, said that during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, YMCA NSW was not a safe organization.
He said that there were serious problems in the appointment, monitoring, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to be the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of a return.
In an interview taken at night on the occasion of his fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
Mr. Blair refrained from discussing British politics by limiting most of his comments to the role of representatives of foreign affairs and the peace architects of the Middle East Group after a decade in June 2007.
When asked if he would like to come back to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by London's Evaning Standard newspaper saying, "Yes, of course, but this is not likely to happen, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When the crowd of experts performing horse for the best horse of the year was gathered in Cardiff, they knew that this would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even in the school and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his grandson Shetland's Tatto Toffee easily completed three phases and received the top prize - he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the Annual Competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestion Centre in Rudry near Cardiff, there was a lot of appreciation for the display, behaviour and style of a pair that cannot be separated.
In front of men and women wearing a beautiful baller hat, he shook his flat hat on the alhad angle and made his two-year-old Toffee ring round.
Decisioners praised Fenton for their natural skills to control which is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest points for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given to Toffee on his third birthday in March last year, and he has practiced with this tattoo of Shetland daily since then.
His 30-year-old Ma Dona said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great pair."
They had to face challenges from all the candidates, but both of them won gold cups and rosets.
This was the second opportunity when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy about his victory.
The most different in this colorhouse, he felt so amazing that he wanted to photograph with him.
This small child of Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Wales is running on the footprints of his anti-Sharan Howles, which has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Smt. Howells said: The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating and playing locks.
He was running on the sand in the whole colorhouse, and despite being so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is a crazy animal - she loves horses, tractors and farms, and she has two chickens whom she cares.
The way he has started, he will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am confident he will perform very well.
An annual horse exhibition spokesman said: "Fenton's age is only three years, but he comes to control his tattoo.
They are very good pairs.
The decision makers gave marks in view of the methods of performance of Fenton and Toffee and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider - Fenton and Toffee were the best in ringing in this case.
I am confident that Fenton's beloved clothes have helped him, he was actually very different.
The plea of the Chinese newspaper will be renovated
A Chinese newspaper which had made an appeal on the mouthpiece to leave a reporter guilty of defamation, it will be restored, a press regulator said this.
Guangzou's newspaper New Express gave a rare public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yogjau.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribe to write a deliberate news about the state's partial ownership company.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through a complete improvement.
"Sudhar's order came from Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration."
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false reports about the listed company oomloyen in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that the editorial management of the New Express was disorganized.
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative penalty by canceling the license of the reporter of "Chen Yogjau".
It had instructed the Yangchen Evening News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the responsible people in the New Express and to immediately amend the leadership team of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles in the New Express, which blamed financial irregularities in a construction-up company named oomloin.
After being prohibited, his newspaper published two mouthpiece appeals for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chain's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chain accepted the state television, writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster CCTV that "In this case, I have damaged the ability to win the confidence of the entire news industry and the people of the country," he said.
I did this mainly because I was greed for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chain's apologies, the New Express issued a mouthpiece apology, which said that it failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have accepted the TV broadcast defects.
Experts say that from time to time, there is a conviction, despite this, in the latter half of this year, a law banned the authorities from binding them to blame themselves.

U.S.-Mexico Drug tunnel found in its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between USA and Mexico has been found, which has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The US authorities have described the tunnel of four feet attributes three feet as one of the most complex secret routes so far discovered.
The tunnel is equivalent to the curved length of about six football pitch, which connects the warehouse near Mexico and San Digo, USA.
This area is full of similar godowns, which makes it easier to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said that it was closed before the passage of any drug from the tunnel.
According to the records of the court, the authorities seized eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the search of the tunnel.
Three persons, whom the officials told that they were working as a driver, were accused of keeping marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If convicted, they can be punished from 10 years imprisonment to life imprisonment.

Taxes on foreign property owners will end London's artificial position
The Finance Department has calculated the CGT measures in a provisional manner, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who presented stamp duty at the rate of 7 for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the 2012 budget, and those who give priority to house in a company rather than a separate person.
The stamp duty received from residential assets in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chellesa in the year 201213 was 708 million pounds, which is already more than the combined yoga of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hambur.
Shri Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high-value households and the introduction of Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a fairly low tax on high-value property, which has no relation with the effect of the old council tax system."
He added that But this step could make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and reluctant to sell the existing owners .
According to the price in prime property, wealthy Southwest London, the top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market, which is spread from Fulham to Vimbaldan, has increased by 11.8 percent last year.
According to the research of Savils, the prices of central London continued to grow by 5.6 per cent every year, but the rising "home market seemed to be slightly lower than the market, as the southwest of the city (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) bounces are seen.
Scientists have highlighted the matter that there is a relationship between the movements of the dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs shake their dumb to the right (for dog's point of view), while restless dogs primarily move their tail to the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle difference of tail and can react to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vellertigra from the University of Trainto said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in that excitement differently, which produces positive or negative sentiments. "
Here we have also tried to see it in other species.
He said that in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite sequence, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
In order to know more about how dogs respond to one-sided dog shook by other dogs, researchers looked at animals watching other dog films.
He measured the heart beats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand why their dumb ever moves on one side and on the other side.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We introduced dogs with dog films - in the shadow picture to deal with realistic editions or other issues that are confused, and we could see the movement of tail and present the tail more left or right. We could present. "
When the animals saw any emotional dog moving their tail on the right (from the dog's point of view), they were completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail turning the direction and turning mainly to the left (from the dog's point of view), his heart beat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, they do not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience that they should be worried about what action and not on whom.
He said: "If you have met many times with other dogs, and if they shake their tail on one side continuously, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of the same experience. . "
Researchers say that these findings can provide better information about animal sentiments to owners, veterinary practitioners and trainers.
Fellow, guest of the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, John Breadshaw, a dog behavior expert, told that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when the dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head towards the right when they see the happy dog.
In another research in the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "As opposed to Italian studies - when the robot dog's tail was moved to the left instead of the right, the dogs were more likely to reach near him rather than restless. "
He said that this difference was because in various studies dogs did not fully understand animals or robot dogs in dog films.
He clarified that in this, the dogs can help study the way they respond to real dogs.
"When there is a lot of evidence from various mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and dogs are not exceptions in this case, he said. "
However, seeing the easily their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their dumb ever moves on one side and on the other side.

Pope Francis to announce the first cardinal name in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time during his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, Catholic Church consists of top class priests, their posts are only below the pope, and they choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of individuals who will eventually help in choosing their successors.
There are a total of 201 cardinals there.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope election - it comes in the group of 120 cardinal electors.
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardy said that before the promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be organized, which is called Pope-Sabbha.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has decided to tell his decision to organize the Pop-Parishad of February so that it is easy to plan other meetings of cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that there was a possibility of a reduction in the number of cardinal electors by February.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the cardinals, and the cardinals above 80 years of age as per their will.
Valero said that the next year's Pope-Chair will be important, because this will be the first Pope-Chair after Francis was elected in March this year.
Currently there is a kind of prejudice to Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see if new popes are nominated by cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance."
In South America, forty percent of Roman Catholics is, but their number in cardinals is very low.
The Cardinals Council by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church, will also be the first cardinals to be selected after the formation.
Prior to this, the pope used to decide all the things themselves.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that it is possible to seek advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we have not been in this situation before - this is absolutely new.
Valero said that usually the pope gives the post of cardinal to the bigger places, but Francis was completely surprising - so we do not know whose name they will declare.
To correct the seatback, GM called back pickup trucks in US
According to an information from US Auto Security Regulators on Friday, the General Motors Company has called back about 19,000 trucks to correct a reduction in the seatback hand-drawn in its altogether new 2014 Shevarley Silverrodo and GMC Sira pickup trucks.
There may be a reduction in the front seat rotating system in some trucks.
As a result, the union failed to comply with auto security standards about the seatback, head restraint.
According to an information put on the National Highway Traffic Security Administration website, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks started to be sent in June and this is the most important launch for the top US automaker after the insolvency renewal of the year 2009.
GM had told truck owners about this defect in the latter half of October.
The Swami could not review the notification letter due to a 16-day official ban on NSTMA, which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that the sale of Silverado and Sera trucks which were redesigned for the year 2014 model was 20 in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 silverrodo and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the share of GM in the New York Stock Exchange was 1.4 percent.
Obama's disappointment of voters
I voted Obama twice as compared to change .
They say that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to the policy of blocking the GOP.
The barrier policy can not excuse Obama's website's problems, drone attacks
Obama ' s 2008 campaign reminds of what could have happened .
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I feel that this second year will encourage me during the discourse of Medical School and will create hopeful rays in me.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is the memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get frustrated with the pamphlets of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me in a period in which politics had inspired millions of people and speeches could stop your breath.
Elections proved unilateral, and news speakers took a break to show the historic importance of that time.
In the eyes of my classmates, there were blessings of joy, and my parents saved every newspaper.
A group of young visually impaired persons was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
During the formation of Obama's President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of the lost opportunities.
There was really a change after I first voted.
Simply say that none of them could have imagined it.
I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Afordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Do not ask, do not tell until Osama bin Laden is killed."
Further, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented many of our efforts to move forward in our country, including immigrant reforms, public options for healthcare, closure of the base at Gwantanamo Bay, and others.
But in a number of times, in which I favored the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, the answer is over to me that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
Republican's opposition policy is not the answer to the spying of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to the drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the National Security Agency's collection of data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens, nor can it answer the prosecution of those who highlight the wrong actions of the government.
It can not tell the cause of the murder of American citizen Anwar L Avalaki without any trial, nor the public funds and expenditure limits reduced during the President's Campagne.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that efforts by the White House to silence the media have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed in the Affordable Care Act Act.
I do not know whether I expected it only.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could break the political campaign that would bring it forward.
It is evident that the elected office is not a forecast, because the opposition political parties and random incidents such as the Newtown murder case will shape our public discussion.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be mostly elected by the administration itself.
This thing troubles you most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidature.
Mit Romani presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not appear to determine their policies or their position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes about which we have been listening for a long time.
However, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to the year 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I miss their missing promises.
In this week, a part of the book was reading, in which it was described how Pennsylvania had a huge loss to Clinton due to Obama in the primary.
In a post-mortem camping meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they need to return back to the track, and there is a need to remain integrity on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, after five years, I cannot agree with you anymore.
The ideas expressed in this comment are from Nathaniel Moris.
Clive Pamar claims that P.M. Tony Abbott's interest in ancestral holiday scheme is a struggle
billionaire M.P. Clive Parmar has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral holiday scheme is a struggle because his daughters can be pregnant, and can take advantage of it.
The Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in dispute over the payment of the  6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed, while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
Parmar United Party can control four votes in the Senate, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Pamar has claimed that only the interests of ministers can be struggled, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from policies.
Mr. Pamar said, "In the case of a given ancestral leave, one of his important interests can be struggled, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, then they will have a direct interest that they will get a holiday or not."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Parmar as the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes.
Mr. Parmar demanded the renovation of the counting of elections to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughter, Francis and Bridget.
Should the results of the election come two months after our voting
He said, "We should have a better system."
Why can not we have a system in which we fill our details on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
Mr. Parmar also criticized the use of pencil to mark the ballot papers.
That's because if a person does not like him, then the promise can erase him
Using pencil in today's era seems to be absolutely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint discussion letter with New ealand.
59-year-old Mr. Parmar said that his policies include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he will take his new work very seriously.
Public post is for public service.
He said that "We should not have any other awards other than the prizes of history that we can serve the community at this important time."
The plaintiffs had to face problems.
Addressing the gathering organized on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong resentment over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said that the fast-growing attacks on advocates and their families prove that the criminals are unconscious.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the security of the common man can be easily estimated.
RBI suspends two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Exchange Department, the information received from two people on the matter, it is another indication that the global investigations by the regulators in the suspicious manipulation of the currency market are progressing at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BSF Barclase, Dush Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the regulators in the investigation in the world's largest financial market in which 5.3 trillion is exchanged every day. Are there.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with the investigation of the case appearing to be repetitive of the Libor Interbank Credit Manipulation case.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation is in progress in this matter, and we are fully cooperating with CA and other regulators."
Last month, experts from the case had said that RBS has been sent to the former trader and sent to the K Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority, the records of email and quick messages received from them.
This trader, Richard User, had left the RBI in 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current post of European Chief of Forex Spot Trading in J.P.Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European Spot Trading in the city, went on leave last week, while former senior currency trader in Barclej and BSF was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
People from the case told that the quick message group of Mr. User includes the bankers of Barclej and Citigroup.
The BSF said that after being told by the Swiss regulator, Finma that she is investigating the suspicious manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks, this week she has taken action against some of her employees.
At the global level, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority, the Department of Justice in VECO, CA, and the Hague Monetary Authority - The bankers are investigating the allegations of mischief to make their favorable fluctuations in the currency market.
People acquainted with the case said that CSB, Citigroup, J.P.Morgan and Credit Suisse have also examined internal investigations, or have received requests for information from the regulators.
Banks are closely investigating quick messages and emails for many years in search of clues for any wrong activity.
The news about the investigation has created a stir in the traders of such areas who have been among the major investors in the trading unit of the banks for the past several years, but they have to face the challenge this year as there has been a reduction in opportunities for the betting persons due to low fluctuations in the currency.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the huge and excessive liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that it is true.
The senior trader said that despite the huge quantity of foreign exchange purchase and sale, the fission of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own platform by the banks means that "you can start affecting the market at a slightly lower ticket price. "
This news came on the same day, on the day Credit Suisse announced the removal of the trader from his Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London this week, which had lost about 6 million at the end of last year.
The bank has notified relevant authorities immediately and is collaborating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said, "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and it has been controlled."

It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money for living is one of the biggest needs, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Triodashi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped by the God of wealth Kuber and death god Yamraj.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
We have a good feeling of money.
The money which can be used for the welfare of humanity can not be more valuable than anything else, but the money which becomes the cause of ego has no meaning.
We earn money for the sacred purpose and spend only for the sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
There should also be a feeling of spending on society, but the tendency of collecting unaccounted or earning yen-ken money destroys our discretion, personality.
The spirit of donation should always be in mind.
A portion of the money given by you can also be the basis for someone's life.
Many people in the society are living in a terrible lack, we all should think for them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the masculines of life.
Everyone wishes for wealth and yash and according to their pursuit they also get wealth and yash.
The same wealth and property are sustainable with which respect is linked.
No matter how rich a criminal is, he can neither consume it properly nor can anyone work for anyone else.
If someone else has money, then do not blame him.
The true rich is the one who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of money.
No one can use money more than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not in the form of currency only.
It would also be in the form of love for your health, character, others.
Try that you become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continues the policy of shutting down the sale of kerosene through ration, then half a dozen states will not get kerosene at these shops.
States where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states of the North-East are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, on two basis, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states.
The first basis is that electricity connections are being made fast in rural areas.
The second basis is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural families have been given LPG connections.
In this regard, the Petroleum Ministry has made a lot of preparations.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to one lakh kilo liters.
70 percent of the allocation of Uttarakhand and the kerosene quota of Haryana was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this reduction, there is no news of the shortage of kerosene from these states.
The ministry is convinced that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently a difference of 37 rupees.
This encourages those who adulterate.
In states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full cost in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.

Modi said on this occasion, "The coalition government was once formed in many states and centers of the country, sometimes the Congress, sometimes the government of the communists and sometimes the BJP government.

Call the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the team do
If the comparative result comes, then the country will not have the question whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever there is a BJP government, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man used to get food for two times.
But when the Congress or its support government was formed, it was not possible to fill the poor man.
A single Congress leader, a single leader of the UPA, is not answering what he did in nine and a half years.
Media people of our country can not even reach them.
Congress has become egoistic.
They do not even answer the media.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.

There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.

Congress friends, we have examined 10 months ago.
In democracy, the people take tests.

In Egypt , the first president elected independently believed in the president .
Mohammad Morsi has sworn in as his post, but his victory day could hardly end the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi promised "new Egypt" while taking oath as the first independently elected president of the country who took the place of Hosni Mubarak removed 16 months ago.
On his formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arab has become the fifth President of Egypt after the first independently elected Islamist President of the world, and the removal of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He sworn in before 18 judges of the court on his chair, on the banks of the Nile river, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown in the live broadcast on the national television, Morsi said that "We are awaiting better future, new Egypt and other republics."
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an illegal organization since its establishment, and who has been targeting the previous governments, 60-year-old Morsi, a trained engineer in the US of the party, said that "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation of a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability. "
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen protected the building and according to the local time, shortly after 11 o'clock in the morning, Morsi came to the small convoy of cars.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new President separately from the President's pomp, the traffic was also stopped for a while, so that his motor car could normally get out of the busy road, which connects the center of the city to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal prestige, which was ridiculed as Brotherhood's non-extremist Khali Tire, increased after his victory and on Friday his speech presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate for all those who want to complete the 2011 revolution against dictatorship.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, took oath before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber and said, "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."

Committee Chairman and Senator Diane Festin said that the program to record the phone of NSA is under the law and I believe that it has contributed significantly to the security of the country.

In the camp, State JD (U) President Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the announcement of the nomination of the workers in 20-point committees will be announced soon.
His indication was that the list is almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will examine the list from his level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of the legislators and MPs has been taken to make the list.
If needed, a large number of reshuffles will be made in the list to give place to old and committed workers.
The general allegation of MLAs and MPs is that the opinion of those people was not taken to make a list of nomination.
The names of people who came after many other parties have been recorded in the list, while many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person also comes from Self. Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a small village of Chorwad in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was third in five siblings.
Five children of the family include Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumti.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the house in childhood.
At this time, he used to plant a bhajiya shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he reached Eden city of Yemen with a ship named Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, they returned to the country.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try luck by keeping 500 rupees in the pocket.
And his business journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back again.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling their Sultanate.
Like father, today the name of these two brothers is also among international businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), during the PM of Atal Vihari Bajpai, there was a time when there was no advertisement issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002). Gaya.
Keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-meter high statue 'Statue of Unity' statue in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Before this there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When asked about Modi's claims from Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari, he said that BJP's PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement to Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this happened because of the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crores for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When Manish Tewari asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertisement.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including advertisement size or advertising rates for that year.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Dr. Georges Well is delivering free healthcare in the rural areas of Cameron
Well and his team see hundreds of patients every weekend .
In Western African countries there is not much physician . For 5000 people there is only one doctor .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or for anyone in the top 10 to make a CNN year hero.
The winner will receive  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well saw his sick father coming to consciousness and going to the hospital unconscious, who were not properly facilitated to assist him.
Jamel Well was injured in a car accident near Cameron's capital Yonde in 1981.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased, which spread to his brain, and made a bloody body, which influenced his rest of his life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in the camera.
If we had money, we would take our father out of the camera.
Instead, Well continued to circulate the very crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and continued to get whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "This is not easy.
You come out of the house at 5 in the morning with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait and die in the mouth of death.
Since the death of Well's father in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 person in Cameron.
If compared, then there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameron can not afford their expenses.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country belongs to the private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty."
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well resolved to solve something.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Centre Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organisation ESCOVIM which goes to rural areas on weekend to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteers group have assisted about 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tied the medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not even with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once by pushing it from rivers and soil.
But when they reach, they actually get respect for the heroes: feast, singing and dance, and the best house to be offered by the community.
Free medical service in these villages is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Well is accompanied by its great smile and endless energy.
Next morning, his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in each journey."
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificate - The need for this document falls in the school but many poor families can not afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local noun.
Operations are usually done at school building, town hall or at home, after the process, the patient goes to a recovery place, and makes a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes in the operation room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers work on Sunday morning and morning.
This is a lot of speed, but the musicians of the village usually help in motivating the party.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group comprising of Cameron physicians and foreign medical students - 700 free medicines last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they assist.
One person said that due to free hernia surgery, she will be able to go to work again.
The person said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a surgical therapist in the hospital, Well also works in private medical clinics around the yoke at night.
He said that this is his second job which finances 60 of his non-profit work, the rest is completed by personal donations.
A second year medical student of Draxel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in the group of Well, Katie O'Maily said, "I do not know when they sleep.
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization, so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Medical and nursing students like O'Malie who come from United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, have this experimental opportunity for them, which they can never get in their country.
O'Malie said, "In the surgery we help in catching tools for Dr. Well or cleaning blood stains, we have been able to get experimental experience."
As a second year medical student in the US, you will never get the opportunity to do this.
Volunteer students usually spend with themselves to reach the cameraon, and they often come with the medical supplies of donation.
But after reaching Yonde, they come and go, and take the expenses of the instructions.
O'Malily says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, the burden of almost the same work is not difficult.
To help others live a happy life, fulfill the promise made to their father, these are those things which give them a lot of joy.
Well says, "I am very happy to do this work.
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, reduce their pain.
See the website of Escovime and find out how to help.

During this, the Chairman of the Senate Sub-committee of European Affairs on Thursday said that the so-called USS manufacturers will go to Europe to help resolve concerns abroad about espionage, and European countries will try to explain the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said that he has spoken to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and he is worried about the threats of preventing participation by them in anti-terror organizations due to frustration about the monitoring by the National Security Agency.
Marfi, president of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee of the Democratic Party for the first time, said in an interview with Washington, "It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that in the context of our anti-terrorist efforts European countries are with us. .
European countries need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA programme.
The news of NSA recording millions of European phone conversations has brought bitterness in connection with some of the US allies, although the agency chief said that these reports are not completely correct, and shows the misunderstanding of metadata shared with the United Nations organized by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden show that NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Agenla Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the incident of espionage on allies and said that it is common for both sides to do so.
In the midst of the ruckus, Marfi said that his office is arranging a Congress visit which is likely to happen this year, and he expressed hope that the delegation will include members of both the parties and both the Chambers.
The names of other participants will be issued in the coming days.
He said that the travel program is still being worked on.
While Marfi said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he said that some "practical relations" must also be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will have to be honest with their people, their espionage programs used for years.
Marfi said, "If we can revise our monitoring program to protect the rights of European people better, but they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are espionage."
During this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit Middle East and Poland, where he will address the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran to the US Monitoring Activities.
