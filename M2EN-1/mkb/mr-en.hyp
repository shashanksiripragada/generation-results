Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Enemy Fighter Vinashay Deepajyotirnamostte
I am grateful to these divine people.
What could be the best idea to remember Deepawali that we should spread light everywhere, spread positiveness and pray to eradicate the spirit of hostility.
Today Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is involved in this thing but now the governments of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that country celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way they realize 'Bharat'.
Friends, Festival tourism in the world used to attract itself.
Our India, which is a country of festivals, has a great potential for festival tourism.
Whether it is Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, it should be our endeavour to take part in the happiness of other states and people of other countries.
We have so many festivals in every state and in every region that people of other countries have a lot of fun.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in increasing tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, it was decided to speed up this Diwali.
I had said - let all of us celebrate this Diwali as the women power of India and the best success achieved by all of us.
Immediately after this, innumerable motivational stories started to grow in the medium of society.
Ramesh, Kochipaka here in Warangal, wrote on Namo App, My mother is my strength.
In 1990, when my daughters were funded, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today, we are among the five beneficiaries.
Ramesh Ji, my greetings to our mothers
Geetika Swamiji, who is active on Twitter, says that for him there are Laxmis of India on Major Khushboo, who are a bus driver, and he was the leader of all the Assam Rifles women.
For poet Tawari ji, what is the power of Laxmi of India, which is also his strength.
They are proud of their best paintings.
He has also secured a very good category in the field of CLAT.
Meghalaya Jain has written that a 92-year-old old woman is providing free water to travellers at the Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghalaya has been inspired by the humility and compassion of Laxmi in India.
Many such stories have been told by the people.
We must take inspiration and do something similar in our surroundings.
I salute all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well-known poet of the 17th century, Sanchi Honma had written a poem in Kannada language in the 17th century.
The same feeling, the word that we are talking about every Lakshmi of India, it seems that its foundation was laid in the 17th century itself.
How beautiful words, how beautiful feelings and how excellent ideas are in these poems of Kannada language.
Our daughters, these are our pride and because of the glory of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and the same future is bright.
My dear countrymen, this is 12th November, 2019, the day when Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated across the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but in the whole world.
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to the Gurudwara of Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji who can tell you, but for that many parts of Mann Ki Baat will be required.
He always kept the spirit of service at the top.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believes that no one can afford the service of the selfless devotion.
He stood firm against socially evil contradictions like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji delivered his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most travellers in our times.
They have lost their hearts because of their direct nature, humility and simplicity wherever they went.
Guru Nanak Devji performed a number of important religious tours which were called as Kashi.
With the message of harmony and equality, he met people, saints and saints everywhere, whether in the north or the south or the east or the west.
It is believed that the famous Santa Shankardev of Assam had also taken inspiration from him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had broken the water problem there.
Guru Nanak Jira Sahab is a famous place in Bidar, which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji, who always remembers us.
During an accident, Guru Nanak ji also traveled north, Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This has led to a strong relationship between the Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet where people considered him a Guru.
They are revered in Uzbekistan, where they went.
During one of his visits, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He settled in the minds of millions of people who followed their teachings with full faith and are still doing it today.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and this was the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these princes have not only visited the Golden Temple but also got the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Thereafter, many princes posted photographs on social media and also wrote glorious about good experiences.
I wish that the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will inspire us to bring his thoughts and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I believe that 31st October will certainly be remembered by you all.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who was a great man to listen to the country.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a unique ability to bring people together, on the other hand, he was able to facilitate with those who had their ideological differences.
Sardar Patel used to keep an eye on small things in a very open manner.
In fact, he was the Man of Details who called for a penance.
In addition, he was a representative of the organisation skills.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country would come to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the systems of the Convention.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
It has been decided that no one will want water.
Moreover, you will be surprised to know that Sardar Patel had taken care of going to a delegate's luggage or a pair of components at the accommodation site.
He urged the farmers to make khadi pizzas.
The farmers have made pisses and sold them to the delegates.
They used to wear their pairs in these pipelines, and they kept the pizzas with us and the tension of going to Chauri in the minds of the representative was removed.
On the other hand, the sale of khadi has increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a remarkable role in the constitution.
He did not have any discrimination on the basis of caste and creed.
Friends, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Home Minister of India, has done a very great bugle and historic task of uniting the institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai had such a special feature that he looked at every moment.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, there were discussions about certain regions in the integration of the country.
He told Mudaliar brothers, architect Ramaswamy Mudaliar and architect Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar that he should take the people of Travancore and sweep the Tricolor there, the first Tricolor in Lakshadweep.
Immediately after his order, the tricolor was thrown and the minds of the neighbouring country of Lakshadweep were quoted.
After this incident, Sardar Patel binded Mudaliar and said that he should ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope that we will visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, the effigy of unity created for the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world on 31st October, 2018.
This is the world's highest statue.
The height of the statue of the freedom fighter of America is double the height.
The tallest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
Every Indian is respected by the poor.
You will be glad that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists went to see the effigy of unity.
This means that everyday eight and a half thousand people will see the grandeur of the statue of unity.
He reiterated the faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in his heart. And now several attractive centres like Select Bag, Phulapakhru Garden, Jungle Safari, Children's Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery have been developing and this has led to local economy and people are getting new employment opportunities.
Keeping in view the convenience of the tourists coming here, the people of many villages are providing such a facility in their homes and homesteps.
Vocational training is also being provided to those who provide home stake at home.
I am sure that the people there have started the farming of dragon fruits and it will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, the topic of unity can be the subject of study.
We are all witnesses of how a place was developed as a world famous tourist destination in a year.
People from the country and abroad come here.
Several systems like transportation, infrastructure, guides, environment supplementary systems are developing one after the other.
There is a huge economic activity and people are building facilities as per the requirements of the passengers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, Last month, a statue of unity in 100 important tourist destinations across the globe has taken the lead.
I hope that if you all take some time out of your valuable time to see a statue of unity, then you will find it.
But I urge that every Indian who takes time to travel should travel at least 15 tourist destinations in India along with the families of his family and wherever he goes, he will be able to spend the night there.
Friends, Since 2014, 31st October is celebrated as National Integration Day every year.
This day inspires us to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country by giving us any price.
On 31st October, every year, the Run for Unity - Ekta Daudcha is being organized.
It will be attended by people from every section of the society.
The Run for Unity is contrary to the fact that this country is one and is moving in one direction and achieving a goal.
However, today people have seen a verse and a verse about marathon.
Run for Unity is also a very comfortable one.
It is also running here, for Fit India and at the same time we are connecting this objective of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body but also the mind and culture have run for India's unity and India's new heights.
You can get information about the run-for-unity in your surroundings.
In this portal, it has been informed about the locations where the Run for Unity will be organized.
All of us will run on 31st October - for the unity of India, for the sake of self-reliance
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has put the country in the grip of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a summit in our lives. And in a country full of diversity like India, on every path, on every path, on every aspect, we must keep on strengthening this mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and active in ensuring the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court on Ram Janmabhoomi had given its financing.
He used to remember that day.
How many people had come to the ground.
They used to play games for the benefit of the situation.
What kind of language was used to fever the environment .
Attempts were also made to fill in different voices.
Everything had taken place for two weeks to fever, but when Ram was born, the government, the political parties, the social organisation, the representatives of the civil society, the sadhus and the sadhus gave a very modest response.
Efforts to reduce stress in the environment.
But I still remember that day.
These things should always be kept in mind and they give us a lot of strength.
This is an example of how unity gives strength to the country.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the death of our mother Prime Minister Indira Gandhi occurred on the same day.
I pay my homage to the nation today.
My dear countrymen, today a story is being heard in every household, a story of every village is being heard in every corner of the country, from the north to the south, from the east to the west and every corner of India.
Every individual, every family, every village has a pleasant experience in terms of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is an effort of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Their results are also 125 crore Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience.
I have heard that I am thinking, let us also tell you.
Just imagine, the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature ranges from 50 to 60 degrees Celsius.
The air is also called as pranavayu.
Even in such a difficult situation, it is no less than a valour.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are protecting the borders of the country by pressing their chests, but they are running clean irrigation campaigns.
I compliment the countrymen for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I thank you.
There is so much cold that some disruption is also difficult.
In such a situation, merger and management of waste is an important task.
Thus, 130 tons of garbage from Glacier and its surrounding areas and that too in such a dense environment, this is a great service.
We all know that Siachen is a part that is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the meaning of running the cleanliness campaign here is to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower areas and also use water of rivers like Nubra and Shiko.
My dear countrymen, Festival is a new festival of awakening in all our lives.
And it is happening in Diwali, especially in every family to buy something or the other, to bring something from the market.
The more we try to purchase local goods, the more Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity.
And I urge you to purchase something that is constructed by our weavers, by the hand of our weavers.
We must have purchased a lot before Diwali.
However, there must be a lot of people who would get a little cheaper if they went after Diwali.
There must have been a lot of people whose purchases have continued.
On the occasion of Deepawali, I would like to urge you to purchase local items.
You can see how important the dream of Mahatma Gandhi can play.
But sometimes there is a fire that remains helpless.
Somewhere wounded.
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, be it any region, caste, religion, creed or language, is always there to express joy to our soldiers and to express their sympathy.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians of India celebrated Parakram Parv.
In 2016, we remembered the goals of the slaughter when our soldiers slapped the slaughter of those who fought against terrorism.
In different parts of the country, your armed forces have made exhibitions so that the maximum number of citizens of the country, especially the younger generation can know their strength.
You will be able to know how strong we are and how our soldiers are protecting our countrymen by fighting for their lives.
May the youth remember the glorious legacy of our Armed Forces and motivate us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is certain that our soldiers who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country will be able to convert their soldiers into smoke.
We have faith in peace and we are committed to encouraging them, but we are not able to tackle the dignity and the value of the country's sovereignty.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was an embarrassment made by our soldiers towards peace.
Even today, India is one of the countries sending more and more troops to the United Nations' rapid peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our soldiers have played a crucial role in ensuring peace across the globe by putting free helmets.
My dear countrymen, the story of the sky is different.
One of the excitements of the people in the Republic Day programme is the Fly Paste in which our air force lays rocks and lays down their capabilities.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who serve the nation.
In 1947, when the Pakistani casualties launched an unprecedented strike, the Air Force seized on timely arrival of Indian soldiers and materials in the battlefield to protect Srinagar.
The air force gave the enemy a smoke in 1965.
Who knows the freedom fighters of Bangladesh in 1971
The Air Force has also played a crucial role in relieving Kargil from the hut in 1999.
On Tiger Hill, the air force smoked them while showering bombs on the hostile enemy sites.
Whether it is help and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful to these brave soldiers of your Air Force.
Their work is amazing to tackle natural calamities and help the people of the country from dispute, flood to forest fire.
In order to ensure equality of women and men in the country, the Air Force has set up ideals, they have opened the doors of each of our departments for the daughters.
Now the Air Force is giving an alternative to the Short Service Commission, which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly proudly say that in our armed forces, along with male power, the same women power is being contributed.
Women are strong, they are also becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of the officers of the Navy, Abhilash Tommy, was giving a boost to life and death.
The entire country was worried about how they could be saved.
You all are aware that Abhilash Tommy is a heroic officer.
He is the first Indian officer to travel the world with a small name from any modern technology.
For the past 80 days, in the South Indian Ocean, Golden Globe Race, he used to keep his steadfastness in the sea, but the Bhagirathi Peace Platform created a crisis before him, but the brave Indian Navy continued to tremble in the sea for several days.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tomy. And this courage, his courage, his determination and his hard work will certainly inspire the young generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, children are also aware of the importance of this day on 2nd October for our country.
On 2nd October this year, we have another special significance.
Two years from now, we are going to organize several events across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The ideas of Mahatma Gandhi inspired the whole world.
Whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, everybody has gained strength from Gandhi's thoughts and has fought a long way to give equality and dignity to our people.
From today's Mann Ki Baat, I want to discuss another important task of our revered Bapu, which most people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, in 1945, the freedom struggle insisted on reforming these ideas.
Revered Bapu placed his thoughts in front of the countrymen on issues such as protecting the rights of farmers, villages and labourers, spreading cleanliness and education.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a folk collection .
It was his nature to connect people and to mix them with them.
Everyone had experienced this arson at all times.
He gave everyone the experience that this person is the most important and vital thing for the country.
The biggest contribution in the freedom struggle is that they have made this fight a mass movement.
Every section of the society, every section of the society, every section of the society, gave a befitting reply to the sacrifice of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom movement.
Bapu gave you an inspirational mantra.
Is it possible that we can gain control over our lives and our lives
Whether it will provide self-reliance to millions of people, those who are oppressed and their soul is insufficient.
Then you will find that your doubts have started decreasing and ego is getting over.
My dear countrymen, a mantra of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, the middle class of the country is growing, the growing economic strength of the people, the growing purchasing power, the purchase of something, can we remember Bapu for a moment
Whoever is fortunate, whose purchase will benefit directly or indirectly.
If we benefit the poorest of the poor, we will be very happy.
Keeping in mind the mantra of Gandhiji, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji in the days to come, we must keep in mind what kind of country we should build because of our purchase.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji. This is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that this small step can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest and the weakest.
But it was possible that India got independence.
Today, we can feel that this small task of mine can also contribute to my country's economic progress, economic empowerment and the strength of the poor to fight against poverty.
In today's era, this is the true patriotism, this is the responsibility of the revered Bapu.
He said that all these khadi clothes have been manufactured very well, every dhaga should be used.
The spirit of intimacy towards the nation and the spirit of affection towards the people of the country was bound up with the glory of the great man of this childhood.
Two days ago, along with the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we are also celebrating the birth anniversary of Scientists.
With the name of Scientists, the feeling of unlimited faith comes in the minds of our Indians.
His intelligent personality is always grateful to every citizen.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked very humble from outside but he was determined to climb the mountains.
The announcement of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is a recognition of his immense personality.
This was the result of his unwavering penance towards the nation that during the nearly one and a half years of work, he gave the mantra of achieving success to the soldiers and farmers of the country.
My dear countrymen, today we are remembering the revered Bapu, it is natural that we will not remain without talking about cleanliness.
The Swachhata Hi Seva campaign was launched from 15th September.
Millions of people participated in this event and I got the privilege of paying homage to the students of Ambedkar School, Delhi.
I went to the school which was laid by Babasaheb himself.
People from all over the country participated in this programme.
Institutional Yat Hiriri participated.
Students, college students, NCCs, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, private industries, all of them have contributed a lot of sanitation.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to all these cleanliness lovers.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the entire world.
At the same time, India is organizing the biggest World Cleanliness Conference in history, Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Convention, which means Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Cleanliness Ministers and experts from all over the world are combining their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention is scheduled to be held on 2nd October 2018 at the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit: "Justice is true to the roots of self rule, when there is a discussion of justice, the spirit of human rights is integral to it.
This is particularly indispensable for the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, deprived people.
The Constitution passed by Babasaheb Ambedkar to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12 October 1993.
In a few days, NHRC will complete 25 years.
The NHRC has worked towards enhancing human reputation along with the protection of human rights.
Our dear leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made it clear that human rights are not a different concept for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, all the buildings in the Vedic period are engraved.
The NHRC has created a comprehensive awareness of human rights and has also played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
In this journey of 25 years, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a hopeful thing for a healthy society and for a better democratic value.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the work of human rights at the national level.
It is the basis of SabkaSath, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas.
This year too, in your village, in the city and in the metropolitan cities, we should organize the 'Run for Unity'.
Sardar Saheb is the best way to remember him because he worked for unity throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to connect every section of the society with unity through the Run for Unity on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, the festival of Rakhipurni is being celebrated throughout the country.
My best wishes to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
Raksha Bandhan is celebrated as a symbol of love and trust between sisters and brothers.
Now Janmashtami will also be celebrated soon.
The atmosphere of 'Hathi, Ghoda, Palaki-Jai Kanhaiyalal Ki, Govinda-Govinda' is going to change.
The joy of going in the colour of Lord Sri Krishna is very charming.
Sir, Updated Sanskrit - Dinmasti.
Sanskrit languages Sarla Iti Sarva Vadanti
Brothers and sisters, the day of Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Diwas.
At the same time, we feel proud that from Vedas to the present language has played an important role in the propagation of knowledge.
In Sanskrit language and literature in this language, knowledge about every sphere of life is enormous.
Not only this, it is also being mentioned in Sanskrit language about the challenge of global growth.
You all will be happy to know that the people of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka still use Sanskrit language to speak.
You will be surprised to know that a special feature of Sanskrit language can create innumerable words in this language.
It is said in a well-known statement of the importance of Guru Nanak in life that the ekampi Akshramastu, Guru: disciples prayed.
My dear countrymen, immense hard work and hard work brings a new hope for our farmers.
Due to heavy heat, this rain is a boon for sand, dry trees and dry water bodies.
But for some time this extremely disastrous, catastrophic Mahapura can be taken .
At some places in the country, there has been heavy rainfall in the balance of other places.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity will soon improve their catastrophe.
But even during such a crisis, we see the philosophy of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody can help the producers at their own level, whether it is in Kerala or in any other district of India.
He tried tirelessly to save the lives of those trapped in the award.
Whether it is the Air Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Air Force, the Border Security Force, the CISF, the RAF and the Army have played an important role in the rescue and assisting operations.
Let us pray that in this sacred period of Onam, the country, especially Kerala, should get the strength to come out of this crisis as soon as possible and that the development journey of Kerala gets a good momentum.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the people of Kerala who have faced such a great crisis in the country.
For the last ten years, he had gone very far from active politics.
But after 16th August, the country and the world saw that even after 10 years of age Atal ji had a great affection for the common man of India.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Reform Act, 2003.
This transformation has led to two significant changes in India's politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of the States was restricted to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limits laid down under the Anti-Pacific Act were one-third, two-thirds.
Clear guidelines have also been made to ensure that the members who have been shifting their pairs become inadequate.
Atalji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time for holding the country's budget was changed in the House.
In the year 2001, Atal ji changed the time of deciding the budget in Parliament to the morning.
Some of the rules of this treaty have made it possible to break public space tricolor.
That is why more and more Indians got the opportunity to foment their national flag.
Atal ji has done a great job to bring our life-loving Tricolor closer to the people.
In this regard, people are considering themselves as opponents.
He saw that by reviving his resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay my homage to Atal ji.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and that of the Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will further protect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court here in Katni, Madhya Pradesh gave a five-day request and taught the culprits to be harassed.
In Rajasthan too, the courts there have been quick decisions on the grievances of women's atrocities.
This Act will play an effective role in preventing the atrocities committed against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
In this season session of Parliament, all the members have put together an ideal paradigm.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the stakeholders of the country at the public level.
My dear countrymen, today the attention of millions of Indians is on the Asian Sports Competition.
Asian sports are still underway.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who won medals for the country.
There has been an increase in the number of medal winners for the country, specially our participants, this gives a very positive signal.
Let us focus on our principles because a healthy, prosperous country can create a prosperous and prosperous India.
Namaste Spirit, I respect our feelings.
Everybody is surprised to see that Patna is a queen of queens built in the 15th century in Gujarat.
India's soil will have to be said as an engineering laboratory.
Several engineers from India are not only able to imagine these things but have also brought them in the realm.
In our tradition, we have achieved such an instance in the legacy of the great actresses.
This is Dr. Bharat Ratna.
M.
Visvesvaraya
Even today lakhs of farmers and people are benefiting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam which he built on the Kaveri river.
It is called 'Bhunga' in Kutch.
I have seen 3-3 earthquakes and experienced these houses.
I myself have experienced three earthquakes in this house.
But go inside and see that you do not see any harm or damage.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the geographical location of Nalanda.
After seeing that house, it was thought in my mind that even before several ages, the engineers of that period had constructed the house in accordance with the local conditions and had studied the way people could be safe.
When we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also think of the future.
Workshops should be taken at some places.
What should we learn in the changing times
What should people learn
How to connect
Nowadays, disaster management has been done a lot.
The entire world has to face natural calamities.
How can there be a new form of structural engineering
How are its different courses
What should the students learn about this
Several such things should be considered when the Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
At the same time, preparations for Diwali will also start.
We will be meeting in Mann Ki Baat and will be talking about it.
At the same time, we are working hard to take our country forward.
With this feeling, my best wishes to all of you.
However, the citizens of some areas are still waiting for Varunraj.
India is huge and there is diversity in it, but in this country, sometimes Varunaraja also shows its favouriteness.
In such a situation, the most important responsibility is that we all should become the protector of nature and protector of nature.
If we become such a nature, then the balance of things in nature will be simplified automatically.
You must have seen this incident on a television.
In fact, it takes usually a few hours to return to that cave.
Now it is not possible to come out, this kid has taken a pledge at a little height in the cave.
If they don't have a day or two, they would have stayed within 18 days.
Now we can imagine how their moments and moments would have taken place in a mental state when there is a direct death.
On the one hand, the entire world was united and manifested the Goddess human qualities.
Specially, after seeing everybody's very moderate behavior, I feel that this is a learning and a learning quality.
Those who were stubborn, their mothers and sisters did not feel sad or they did not feel tired of sadness.
But with patience and restraint, the peaceful behavior of the entire society is a matter of great importance.
In the entire campaign of this help, a soldier from Thai Navy had to lose his life.
These youngsters showed the bravery of patience and patience for those who were trapped in the cave in extremely difficult situations, which were filled with water and darkness.
This incident showed that when humanity was united, such miracles occurred.
But for that we only need to work calmly and steadfastly and focus on those things that we are working for.
A few days ago, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us alone.
Neeraj ji was a special feature.
He believed in himself with hope, belief and determination.
Everything of Neeraj ji can be very inspiring and powerful to all Indians.
Friends, July and August are very important for the farmers and all the youngsters.
Because there is a problem of admission of colleges in this period.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam come out of their lives and enter colleges.
Youngsters are stepping on a new path in their lives, so our focus is far away from the question and comes to the cut-off.
The attention of the students is now from the house to the Vastitute.
Students have come out of the umbrella of their parents and come under the umbrella of their professors.
I am sure that my young friends may be very enthusiastic about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, we should leave our homes and leave our villages and go out on the other side, we have to come out of a safe environment and become ourselves.
Many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a different direction to their lives.
I would like to tell you all that you remain calm and enjoy this life.
You have to study, but while learning, the natural eagerness of finding new things should be maintained in you.
Old friends have a special role.
I see that a student named Asharam Choudhary, a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, has achieved many academic success in combating many difficulties in life.
The entrance examination of MBBS for ASHARAM Jodhpurs AIIMS has been expedited in the first attempt.
Anushka Panda, a disabled Kanya of Gurgaon, is suffering from a genetic disease called 'Sapanel Muscular Atrophy'.
All of them have been watching the entire world with their determination and with all the difficulties faced by them.
If we look at it, we will be able to see several such examples.
Any good event in any part of the country or in any part of the country is giving energy to my mind.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I noticed that two youngsters had realized the dream of Modi.
On reading the news, I realized that today our youngsters use technology to bring about changes in the lives of the common man.
The incident was such that San Jose City of America was considered as the center of technology and once I was talking to the Indian youth there.
At that time, I appealed to them to think about how you can use your wisdom and talent for your India and take a little time out of it.
I had called upon the Brain-Drain issue to get the answer from Brain-Gene.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji accepted my request and brought an innovative pen.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have combined a SmartGov App using their professional skills.
This app not only connects the people of the villages to the entire world but also provides information and information on your mobile phones through this app.
The residents of Tadukpur village in Rae Bareli, the village head- Sarpanch, the district magistrate, the chief district officer, all have created awareness among the people to use this app.
Indeed, the legacy of Pandharpur is a wonderful journey.
Friends, this year, on 23rd July, Ashadi Ekdashi, Pandharpur is celebrated with great devotion.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
The legacy of great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram is on foot in the direction of Pandharpur while roaming silver and silver.
Vithal, who is also called Vithoba or Pandurang, is visiting Pandharpur for his vision.
It is a God that protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
In the minds of the people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, there is immense devotion and devotion to Panduranga.
Let us go to the Vithob Temple in Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
Important messages of goodwill, love and brotherhood have been given from the literature of these saints.
These saints gave the mantra of strengthening the fight against superstition.
He also spoke of the compassion, equality and integrity of the people.
Lokmanya Tilak means adventure and self-confidence.
The British tried their best to prove them by running the monarchy three times in 20 years.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen, an incident that took place on the effigy of Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
At that time, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad for their reception and during this visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel got the opportunity to interact with Tilak.
The personality of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak was very impressed by the ideas.
On August 1, 1920, Lokmanya Tilak was confronted and after that, Patel decided to build a memorial at Tilak in Ahmedabad.
On 28th February, 1929, Mahatma Gandhi inaugurated the memorial by Sardar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, this effigy is also very unique and Lokmanya Tilak has settled on a chair and has written, "Swaraj Hamara is the birth right" below Tilak.
Public Ganesh Festival, along with traditional reverence and devotion, became an effective medium for social awareness, collective action, harmony and equality among the people.
In that particular period, there was a need to fight unitedly against the British.
And because of the festivals started by the Tilaks, we have worked to unite everyone by breaking the walls of caste and sects.
The popularity of organizing these festivals in the Ogha of the time has increased and it has been noticed that today's youth is also very attractive for the brave heroes of our ancient traditions and history.
Today, in many cities, a pavilion of Ganesh festivals is seen in almost every street.
All the families of the streets together organize Ganapati festivals.
Youngsters get good opportunities here too, their leadership, festival organizers, programme organizers and coordinators can develop their qualities.
From the idol of Ganeshji to the decorated goods there should be some environmental affection .
Today, every Indian needs to get good results of good governance and development.
I talk about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad brought his life to him, but he never driven away from foreign rule.
I am fortunate that Chandrashekhar Azad village is Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and I got the opportunity to visit this village.
I also got the opportunity to pay my homage at Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad. Even if Chandrashekhar Azad did not want to die by the pillars of foreigners, he would continue to fight for freedom and sacrifice for freedom.
This was his specialty.
Once again I salute both the great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, the junior under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland has created a new history by winning a gold medal by winning a gold medal from India's brave daughter and a son of a landlord.
Another unity of the country has sent me an e-mail from Indonesia as a reply to my letter, and today unity is preparing for Asian sports competition.
Ekta in our e-mail has written that one of the most important moments in the life of athletes is the moment when the sportsperson holds a tricolor in his hands.
"Ekta, we all feel proud of you.
We are proud of you for brightening the name of our country.
World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 in Tunisia has won gold and bronze medals.
We should move forward, play and keep on developing.
My dear countrymen, several historical events have taken place in the month of August and several festivals also take place this month, but during the monsoon season, illness also takes place in the house for a while.
Once again, I must visit Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, I once again got the opportunity to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Just a few days ago, there was a historic confrontation of cricket in Bengaluru.
You must have noticed that I am talking about the cricket cassette between India and Afghanistan.
Both sides witnessed very good sports in this fight.
Rasheed Khan, a Roundtable from Afghanistan, performed very well in the IPL this year.
I thank our Indian friends for providing a platform to our sportspersons for their skills.
Responsibilities are the best and best in Afghanistan.
The experience of sportspersonship has come to us in this hour.
Sports is a very good medium to unite society and showcase the skills and talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will continue to play with each other in such a way that we will continue to grow.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, the fourth Yoga Day was a different view.
Whether it is the European Parliament, the United Nations headquarters in New York, or the Japanese Navy's warship, people are all seen doing yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, Yoga was a historic event and I got to know that this time women were guided to do many asanas.
In Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China jointly practiced Yoga on the snowy mountain ranges.
It is working to connect everyone with the boundaries of the borders.
Thousands of enthusiastic people of hundreds of countries have performed a very big celebration of Yoga Day due to differences in religion, region, color or sex.
If people from all over the world participated in such excitement programmes on Yoga Day, then wouldn't there be any excitement in India
The security forces of our country, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers, the soldiers and the soldiers.
Some brave soldiers performed Yoga on Panbudi.
Some soldiers practiced yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our Air Force warriors, the warrior Jawans, were surprised by Yoga in the sky at a height of 15,000 feet above the ground.
It is a matter of fact that he did not practice Yoga while sitting in the plane.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or playgrounds, yoga practices have been done in all directions.
We have come to the world with the feeling of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' since ancient times.
Our Saints, Muni and Saints have always emphasized on this idea.
Today, Yoga has proved it in the right way.
Today, the idea of Wellness is working on a revolutionary line.
We see Mother as God, mother gives birth to us and we consider her as a god, this is our culture.
Sometimes the doctor gives us reproduction.
The role of doctors is not limited to medication.
The Not Count Count Country But Also Heal (The Not Only Curie Potato Allso Hell) doctors have medical knowledge and they have a good experience of how their lifestyles can be influenced and what kind of impact they have on their health.
Indian doctors have made their own unique, independent identity throughout the world by showing their unparalleled potential and skills.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our fellow citizens on the occasion of Dr.
India has a rich history.
When I was in Gujarat, when I was working there, a large national conference was held by the people of the tradition of Saint Kabir.
In the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh, the village of Maghar, Saint Kabir Das had taken a pilgrimage.
But did you know that Kabir Das ji had chosen Maghar for the sanctuary
At that time it was believed that those who died in Maghar did not get a place in heaven.
And in contrast, those who harass Kashi go to heaven.
Maghar was considered to be an infamous place, but Saint Kabir Das was not convinced of such things.
Saint Kabir Das ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through credentials and enterprises.
This was his ideal.
We see this ideal from their creations.
The meaning of this is that those who understand the pain of others are true fakir and sant .
And those who do not know the grief of others are loyal.
Kabir Dasji had specially emphasized on social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time.
The knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and respect them.
Even today, Kabir's words are equally effective.
Today we have read and heard about the things of Kabir ji, it seems that these things are telling us about the knowledge of today.
We feel that their thoughts are in harmony with today's times.
Now we are talking about Sant Kabir Das ji and I remember one of his talents, he says: Guru Gobind Doo Dhe, Kake Application
There are such great Gurus, Jagatguru-Guru Nanak Dev.
He has shown the way for crores of people and has been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy means the service of God.
Wherever he went, he worked for the welfare of the society.
He brought forth a socially discriminatory kitchen, such a kitchen can be eaten by a person belonging to any caste, religion and community, and Guru Nanak Dev himself started the method of 'Langar'.
Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrating the 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
The horrific incident in Jallianwala Bagh will be completed in 2019, which was a blow to the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always victorious.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee's birth anniversary and in today's programme, I am Dr.
During 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was a great contributor.
He was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Let us move, let us all, Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
It will be said that they have got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of people due to the benefits.
In remote-modern villages, the youth are providing service facilities to the elderly through common service centres from the age group of villages.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister used to collect Sitafal and do business of making her ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing medicines at affordable rates in nearby villages.
I am extremely happy that the success of the common man is more than the success of the government in this entire programme.
In such a disappointing environment, we will not be able to give credit to the government for the hope, new enthusiasm and events happening in our lives.
The incident of a small girl from a small village in the remote and remote areas also inspires 125 crore countrymen.
With the help of technology, interacting with the beneficiaries through video bridge, a moment spent in their presence has also become a very pleasant and inspiring moment.
In another way, new joy, new enthusiasm and new inspiration were given to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge programme and they gave me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
On the one hand, there are professionals and technologists and on the other hand our farmers who work in the fields are brothers and sisters.
Now we will also be thinking that agriculture and technology are both different businesses.
Successful efforts were made to prepare the scheme and increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, from the production of crops to its marketing, the role of the farmers is important, while on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the participation of the farmers.
Friends
This work done in youth is really inspiring the youngsters.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
I would like to give maximum credit to the states for improving One Nation One Tax.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example in which all the States together decided for the interest of the country and thereafter tax reforms were possible at such a large scale in the country.
So far 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and people from different political viewpoints have gathered in this meeting.
Before GST, there were 17 different types of tax systems in the country but now the new system has been implemented in the entire country.
GST is a victory of authenticity and it is also a festival of authenticity.
Earlier, there were several complaints regarding Inspector Raj in taxation.
GST, perhaps, the world's largest tax reforms.
Generally, a period of 5-7 years would have come to an end to improve the situation in such a large numbers, as well as to ensure complete stability of the entire scheme.
Recently, 21st Commonwealth Sports Competition was held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
Whenever there is such an environment, someone can remain untouched by it.
This was the time when people from all over the country had to think about who would play games today.
How many medals would be India's performance and all these were very natural.
Our sportspersons also performed well by fulfilling the expectations of the countrymen and won a medal in a syllabus.
Whether it is neembaji, cosmetics, logistics, table tennis or badminton India has made the best performance.
26 Gold, 20 Silver 20 Bronze India has earned a total of 66 medals.
Every Indian is proud of this success.
It is a matter of pride and joy for every sportsman.
This is a moment of great pride for all the people of the country.
Perhaps my words will be reduced to express that feeling.
But I want to tell you what I have heard from these players.
This is the reason why there were many such things that happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won medals in all the competitions she participated.
This is the first Indian female sportsperson who won Indias first gold medal in the individual table tennis competition.
India has received the highest medal in Nambaji.
15-year-old Indian sportsperson Anish Bhapar became the youngest sportsperson in the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Choudhary, who won a medal in the Commonwealth Games, is the only Indian Para Power Lifter.
The sports competition was also special because most of the medal winners were female players.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, sportspersons, women sportspersons have performed well.
Everyone was keen on this fight, both medals were available to India.
The sportspersons who participated in the competition had come from different parts of the country from small towns.
He also contributed to his friends who elevated their morale in every situation.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I had invited the countrymen, especially our youth, to Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India and represent Fit India.
And I am very happy that people are participating in it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have written letters showcasing their text, have sent letters and shared their health mantra- Fit India story on social media.
A household Shasikant Bhosale has written sharing his picture in the water conservation pond - My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written - I feel happy and healthy because of Morning Walk.
And further say - For me - fitness cames with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that happiness is healthy.
Dhawal Prajapati shared his photograph of mountaineering that this is Fit India for me, travel and trekking.
I am very happy to see that many famous people are encouraging our youth in a very attractive way for a Fit India.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences in Fit India.
I believe that such movements are extremely beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
I would like to tell you one more thing - Fit India is not spending any money.
The significance of International Day of Yoga is now remembered by the whole world.
You will also get ready from now on.
Your cities, your villages, your departments, your schools, your colleges, every individual, male or female, should try to participate in Yoga.
I want to talk to you today to invite you for a new job and I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new this time.
My young friends, I request you to join a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, Human Resource Development, Department of Drinking Water, have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Green Internship 2018.
Students from colleges, students, youth of NCC, youth of NSS, youth of Nehru Yuva Kendras, those who want to make changes in society, want to become representatives
And when we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from October 2, we will get the pleasure of doing something before and I also tell you that the best administrators who have done excellent work in colleges and universities will be given the National Awards.
Moreover, the UGC will also provide two credit points to those trainees who will complete this.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of this internship.
You can register on MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youth will definitely succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us use these holidays as an opportunity for a new experience.
This group of youngsters has launched a massive campaign for the education of children living on roads and slums.
Initially, the situation of children who had been demanding a road or doing a small job left them so much that they gave up their lives in this work.
Beginning with 15 children from the nearest slums of Gita Colony in Delhi, this campaign has now reached 2,000 children from 12 locations in the capital.
Young and educators associated with this campaign have been involved in this vibrant effort to bring about a social change by taking two hours from their daily routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers in the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become inspirational for the farmers of the country.
He has changed the fate of not only himself but also of our region through collective efforts.
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, pickles of Mandwa, Chowlait Maka or Java are taken.
They started making biscuits from these farms and started selling them.
These farmers have set up a cooperative society in Munnar village and have opened a factory to prepare biscuits there.
Taking a dig at the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only in about 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual upheaval of the institute has not only reached Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs, but it has also reduced the livelihood of more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be war for water in the world in the future.
Everyone speaks this but is it not our responsibility
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Every person should have the responsibility.
Our ancestors have done this for centuries.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
He has discovered new measures to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu may have written a large number of scriptures in some temples of Tamil Nadu in the context of irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will be able to see a lot of pictures everywhere.
Even today, various giants are popular as tourist destinations, but we do not forget that these live tests of water conservation campaign of our ancestors are also alive.
The queen of Adlaj and Patan in Gujarat is a UNESCO World Heritage and its magnificence is worth seeing.
Vihiri is in a way a water temple .
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Chand Vihar in Jodhpur.
This is India's largest and well-known leader and the most important thing is that there is a lack of water in the region.
It is April, May, July, when there is a good opportunity to collect rain water and if we prepare it earlier then we will get more benefits.
The funds of MNREGA are also used in the work of water conservation.
In the last three years, everyone has tried their own way towards water conservation and water conservation.
In addition to the MNREGA fund every year, 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management.
If we talk about 2017-18, 55 of the total expenditure of 64 thousand crore has been spent on work like water conservation.
Approximately 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted due to water conservation and water conservation measures in the last three years.
The district administration under MNREGA has taken up the responsibility of land and water conservation in a big way.
With the help of people from around 40 to 45 villages, these dry rivers have been revived.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, farming or villages, this is a big success.
I would like to say that once again in April, May, June, July, we are in front of us, we should take some responsibility for water conservation, we should also formulate some schemes and we should do something.
When Mann Ki Baat is there, I get messages, letters and phone calls from all around.
Ian Kumar Banerjee of Deotola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written on MyGov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know the philosophy of the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore's calm, beautiful and accurate life.
Please discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat programme.
I express my gratitude to Ianji that he has attracted the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was an individual of knowledge and wisdom, whose writing has created a stagnation on all.
Rabindranath was an impressive, multi-disciplinary person, but every moment he was a teacher.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Sangeet at Radio early in the morning and when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems, Aguner and Poroshmani then I got a new feeling.
You must have enjoyed Rabindra Sangeet and his poetry.
I pay my homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The holy month of Ramzan will begin in a few days.
The month of Ramadan is celebrated throughout the world with full faith and respect.
The collective purpose of the day is that when a person is self-harming then he also feels the hunger of others.
When he feels thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammed.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once a person asked the Prophet - what is the best thing in Islam
Prophet Saheb said, Giving food to the poor and the needy and enlightening everyone, whether you recognize them or not.
He believed in the knowledge and compassion of the sent Mohammad.
They didn't have any ego.
He used to say that ego defeats knowledge.
The sent Mohammad believed that a person was not due to wealth, but because of his sacred spirit.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people all over the world.
This Buddha Purnima remembers Lord Buddha and reminds him of the responsibility of following the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, unity and brotherhood.
These are human values that are the most urgent in the world today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar insisted that his social philosophy is inspired by Lord Buddha.
Babasaheb empowered millions of people be it dalits, victims, exploited or deprived through knees.
This cannot be a big example of compassion.
In order to understand the grief of the people, Karuna was one of the great qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that the Buddhist monks travelled in different countries, taking the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha along with them, and it always happens.
In Asia, the legacy of Lord Buddha's teachings has been obtained.
Several Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar have deepened many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings. This is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect important Buddhist sites in South East Asia with the important Buddhist sites of India.
I am very happy that the Government of India is a partner in the revival of several Buddhist temples, including the beautiful Anand Temple of Bagan in Myanmar, hundreds of years ago.
Today, everywhere in the world, there is conflict and human misery, and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to finish the passion.
I convey my best wishes to all those who believe in the principle of compassion and respect for Lord Buddha all over the world.
Lord Buddha asks for blessings for the entire world so that we can fulfill our obligation to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the pillars of Laughing Buddha, it is believed that Laughing Buddha brings good fortune, but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in the history of India's defence history.
Now you are wondering what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and India's military power
That was Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May 1998, at Pokhran in Rajasthan, at Paramnu test was conducted.
20 years have been completed and Buddha Purnima was tested with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias test was successful and thus India showed its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that those days have been marked in the history of India in the form of its military strength.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when we are strong as a nation, we walk a peaceful path with everyone.
In May 1998, it was not only important for the country but the way it was conducted is important.
This incident showed the entire world that this land of India is the land of great scientists and India can achieve new heights with diverse leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra Jai Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
We are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 11th May, 1998, when Atal ji gave us the mantra of 'Jai Vigyan' for India's strength, we should resolve to contribute to the creation of a modern India, to build a powerful India, to build a strong India.
Participate your strength in the power of India.
We can also get a new joy and a new solution to take forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, visit the next Mann Ki Baat programme and shout further.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the sacred festival of Ram Navami .
A few days ago, when all the leaders of the ASEAN nation had come here on 26th January, the art path of that country had also come here.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of his countries have presented Ramayana in front of us.
It means that Ram and Ramayana are not only in India but also in this land of the world.

I have written to them on the thanks given by Anga, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai behind the book Ekjam Warrior.
I would like to tell you all that these letters of yours break the tiredness of my life.

Even if I decide to tell you the same thing today, I will have to say the same thing for months or months.
This time more and more letters have been sent to the children and they have also been asked about the examination.
Your plains have told me on leave.
In summer, animals and birds do not get water, they are worried about it.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to the farmers about the things they do in the country.
Some awakening citizens have taken steps to ensure water conservation.
Since we have started this Mann Ki Baat through radio with each other, I have experienced a way since then, most of the papers come on the subjects related to summer.
Previously, there are letters regarding the examination of students before the examination.
That is, things in mind change according to the season and perhaps it is true that these things in our minds can change the weather in others' lives and cannot change
Whenever I get to read in your letter, I get to know how the recipient of Kareemganj in Assam, Ahmad Ali, has built nine schools for the poor under his will, then I get to see the country's rare will power.
When I got to hear about Dr. Mohan Choudhary from Kanpur, he goes to the pavement to feed the poor and he also provides free medicines, then I get the opportunity to feel the feeling of brotherhood in the country.

These initiatives have succeeded in the efforts of Akher Sadul Laskar after collecting 12 years of money.

Today, the vision of the entire world towards India has changed.
Today, when the name of India is taken with great pride, it is the strength of the sons and daughters of Mother India.
A positive atmosphere of self-confidence has been created with hope.
This self-confidence, this will fulfill our resolve of a New India.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months, our farmer brothers and sisters are very important.
Be it Mahatma Gandhi or Scientific, Lohiaji or Chaudhari Charansinghji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, the farmers and the farmers consider these as an integral part of the country's economy and normal life.
At the same time, Lal Bahadur Shastri also used to emphasize on the safety of trees, plants and plants and better agricultural structure.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged farmers to use new technologies, innovation and use them.
This state with a very small area has done a great job.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record production during 2015-16 as compared to last five years.
They have proved through their experience that when the goals are certain, strong resolutions, will power to realize them.
Brothers and sisters, A significant decision has been taken in this regard to ensure that the farmers get the right price in the country's economy.
It has been decided that more than one and a half times the value of their production cost will be given to the farmers in the prescribed manner.
The cost of cultivation, the cost of cultivation, the cost of cultivation, the cost of cultivation, the cost of cultivation, the cost of cattle, the cost of cultivation, the cost of cultivation, the price of all types of fertilizers, the interest paid to the State Government, the farming land on the harvest, the farming land on the harvest, not only the crops, but the farmers themselves, whoever works in his family, the value of his labour will also be linked to the cost of production.
Besides, the work of improving the agriculture sector across the country is also going on at a rapid pace so that the farmers get the right market.
Efforts are being made to bring together local markets in the villages, geographical markets and global markets.
In order to ensure that the farmers do not have to go far away to sell their goods, they are being modernized by providing the necessary infrastructure to 22,000 rural markets in the country, after which they will be linked to the Agricultural Income Market Committee and e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect the agriculture with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is our pledge, apart from this, how can we bring together 125 crore citizens to best practices for Gandhiji
How should Gandhi 150 vision be logged
Together we will pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and inspire our country to scale new heights by remembering Bapu.
Today, in the field of health, the country has moved ahead with a traditional approach.
The responsibility of doing all the work related to health in the country was already understood by the Health Ministry.
But now all the Ministries and Departments, be it Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Department of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ministry of Women and Child Development or State Governments, all the departments are working together for a healthy India.
The preventive care of health is the cheapest and easiest solution.
This will benefit the people, the family and the society as much as possible to take care of health.
Besides, work is on a massive scale towards setting up health facilities across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity in the world today in the field of preventive healthcare.
The body remains healthy and strong by yoga
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement because of the bitterness of Yoga of all of us.
This year's International Day of Yoga, which means that there are more than 100 days casting on 21st June.
In the last three years, people from all over the country and around the world participated in the International Day of Yoga with great enthusiasm.
This year too, we should do Yoga ourselves and motivate our entire family, our friends and all others to do yoga.
We have to do the work of popularising the new, attractive methods of Yoga, youth and senior citizens and women and men of every age.
However, the country's telecommunications and electronics broadcasting programmes have been organised throughout the year.
But can we do some programmes to create awareness about Yoga as a campaign till today
My dear countrymen, I am not a practitioner but a Yoga practitioner.
However, some people have made me a practitioner by using their imagination and have made some thrilled animated videos of my Yoga.
I am able to teach you this video pochevan together asanas and practices.
Today, more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines are available at a very interesting rate.
The work on starting another new centre is also going on.
I urge the workers of Mann Ki Baat to ensure that the information of these Janaushadhi Kendras is delivered to the needy people, that is, their medicines will be reduced to a great extent and they will get a great service.
The cost of stents required for heart patients has been reduced by 85.
The price of equipment for knee implants has been reduced from 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, nearly 10 crore families, that is, for the treatment of nearly 50 crore citizens, Rs. 5 lakh will be provided by the Government of India and insurance companies in a year.
The total number of seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
New AIIMS hospitals are being opened in different states to provide better treatment and better healthcare facilities to the people of the country.
A new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
We aim to make the entire country free from tuberculosis by 2025.
This is a very big task.
Your help is required to be awakened to every individual.
To get rid of tuberculosis all of us will have to work together .
My dear countrymen, on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had called for industrialization in the country.
He said that the poorest of the poor will also be provided employment by the industries.
Today, the 'Make in India' campaign is being successfully launched in the country.
In such a situation, Dr. Ambedkar has inspired us to dream of becoming an industrial super power.
India has become the world's largest FDI destination in the world.
The world is looking at India as a hub of investment, research and development.
Further, this idea was launched by the Smart City Mission and the Urban Mission to provide facilities like good roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had firm faith in self-respect.
It was not acceptable to anybody to lead a life in his duties.
He also believed that the poor will not be able to get rid of their poverty by providing them with a comfortable facilitation.
Young researchers and young entrepreneurs are making initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start Up India and Stand Up India.
He had seen the Jal Shakti as a nation power.
Babasaheb's vision was to identify the importance of waterways in the development of the country.
Today, historical efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are developing on different seashores of India and infrastructure in old ports is being strengthened.
In the decade of 1940, there were major issues of discussion, other major conflicts, coolness and conflicts.
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar lay the foundation stone of Tim India in a way.
He spoke of the importance of the federal system and stressed on working together by the Centre and States for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every department of the government.
And most importantly, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is the inspiration of crores of backward classes like me.
We need not only be born in a reputed family, but those who are born in a poor family in India can also dream of fulfilling the dreams and can succeed in it.
Sometimes many people have taken the help of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India which belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor and the backward.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan will be organised from 14th April to 5th May on the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
There will be various programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to participate in this programme in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, several festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi are coming in the coming days.
It is a day to learn from Lord Mahavir Jayanti i. e.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who preached non-violence, are inspiring for all of us.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
The Easter said that the Lord remembers the inspirational teachings of Jesus and gave the message of peace, goodwill, justice, compassion and compassion to the people.
In April the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India .
Many thanks
We are the first to see the colour of the sea blue, but in everyday life we feel that water is colorless, it is not colorful.
Whether it be the river or the sea or the water in it looks colorful, should we ever think of it
This question came to the mind of a young man in the decade of 1920.
A great scientist of modern India emerged from this question.
He was honored with the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light screening.
Raman Effect is his discovery.
On 28th February, Raman was considered to have discovered Light Scattering, so we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day every year, he received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
He gave several great scientists in the field of indigenous science.
On the one hand, there was a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta while on the other hand, Sushruta and Charak have a place of pride in health care.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Gobind Khurna to Satyendranath Bose, the scientists are Indias pride.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose has also been given the name of Boson Part.
At the same time, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme of the Wadhwani Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It was a great pleasure to know about the magnificence of science.
Through artificial intelligence, it helps in creating robots and smooth working machines.
Nowadays the machines are swimming their own wisdom with self-education.
This technology can be used to simplify the lives of poor, deprived and needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community how to use artificial intelligence to facilitate the lives of disabled brothers and sisters.
Can we imagine the natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, the Prime Minister of Israel had the opportunity to visit Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There a young man had developed a digital device that he was not able to speak. He had written that he was transformed into a voice. And he can interact with this person as he talks to a person.
I believe that in many such places we can use artificial intelligence.
The machine works as we wish.
But what we want to do with the machine is dependent on us.
The use of science for human welfare and the use of science for the highest height of human life.
Thomas Alva Addison, who has discovered the philosophy of windows, has been used many times in his many experiments.
When asked about this, he said that I have found ten thousand methods of winnership, that is, Addison has made his necessity strong.
Today, by Yoga, I have assumed the workplace of Maharishi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, demanded resistance against their rule.
As a great saint, he presented questions on every aspect of his life.
His answer was discovered and showed the path to humanity.
The feeling of repeated questions is important to know the truth.
This is also the inspiration behind scientific research.
Whether or not the answers to these questions should not be restored.
On National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to all those associated with our scientific and science sector.
May our younger generation be motivated for the discovery of truth and knowledge and be motivated to serve society with the help of science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages on the issue of survival and disasters during the scarcity and crisis.
From Pune, Rabindra Singh has written on Narendra Modi Mobile Power about professional security in his response.
He wrote that the quality of safety in our country is not good at factories and construction.
On the occasion of the National Security Day of India, on March 4, the Prime Minister said that Safety should be taken up in this programme, which will enhance awareness among the people about safety.
When we talk about public security, two things are important, they are ready and ready.
Safety is of two types - one that is necessary at the time of calamity and the other is essential in everyday life.
We were not aware of the safety of everyday life, but it was difficult to gain salvation during disasters.
If we follow the necessary rules, we can save our society from great misery along with protecting our lives.
We see that many things have been written about safety in the workplace but it does not seem to be the same.
The municipal corporations, municipalities, who have uncontrolled cars, should go to school once in a week or month at a rapid pace to drive a mock to the students.
It will have two benefits, the Agricultural Party will also have the habit of staying alert and the new generation will also get education. And it is not necessary to spend a lot of money in a way, in a way it becomes part of education.
When we talk about disasters and crises, India is geographically diversified.
This country has suffered some natural, man-made, disaster and chemical and industrial accidents.
National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on the country's disaster management.
Disturbed NDMAs such as hunger, floods, plains and landslides are running rapidly.
Training and awareness have an important role.
Thousands of people had to lose their lives every year in the heat wave of two-three years, after which NDMA launched a campaign to create awareness and organised workshops.
It can be noted that if we give priority to security then we can achieve security.
The Agricultural Service, the National Disaster Response Team, the Armed Forces, the Bahadur Jawans of the Armed Forces, do not sacrifice their lives during the crisis, they help the people.
NCCs and Scouts also assist in this work and impart training.
The joint disaster management of the countries of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Nepal was the first and widespread effort.
These values should become an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in this period's budget, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, wealth and waste have been emphasized on the development of energy from the waste to the villages through biomass.
The initiative has been initiated and named as Gobar Dhan and Gallehanaging Organic Bio Agro Resources.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from the sewage and biological fertilizer, but it has not been fully utilised in India.
We are moving in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural.
Animal Husbandry seeds, farm waste and kitchen waste have been used for manufacturing based energy on biomass.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmers and brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged to see the crops and waste as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in cleaning the villages.
Farmers and animal husbandry will help in increasing the income.
Employment opportunities will increase due to collection of waste, transportation and sale of biomass.
An online bench for implementation of Gobar Dhan Yojana will be created through which farmers will be connected to the consumer and they will get the right price for sugarcane and agricultural produce.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India, to take advantage of this opportunity by creating a set of books and cooperative societies.
I invite you to become a partner in this movement for clean energy and green employment, and take a lead in transforming the wealth of our villages into wealth and transforming the wealth of the waste into wealth.
Specific artworks were created using waste.
Workshops were organised to educate people about all aspects of waste management.
Each one of them made an idea of cleanliness, performed it, performed poetry.
A festival has been created on cleanliness.
Particularly school students took part in this.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation and Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which this festival was celebrated.
8th March every year is celebrated as International Women's Day.
Several programmes are organized in the country and around the world.
Women doing remarkable work in different fields are honored this day.
Today, the country is moving ahead in the direction of women development under the leadership of women.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's ideas, he had said, Adarsh women's resolve is freedom.
125 years ago, Swamijis idea of women power in Indian culture is reflected in the minds of women.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are a part of a tradition where women are recognized by men, the son of Safioda, the son of Kaushalya, the son of Gandhari.
Women are empowered, strong, equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of New India.
A few days ago, a person had suggested a good thing to me. He said that on 8th March there are several programmes on the occasion of Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat Representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahi 50 thousand Raj Mistry
You can imagine what a big event is.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is the power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into a peoples mind.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I had reached the village Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You know that this island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
For 70 years, the life of the people of Rajbandar, Morbandar and Seat Port had spread darkness in three villages in Elephant.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves of Elephanta have now emerged.
This is not just a electricity but a new beginning.
What can be a matter of greater happiness in the lives of the countrymen
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated Mahashivaratri.
This month is a special feature of the month of March.
We love this month for the festival of Holi.
Holi will be celebrated with enthusiasm across the country on 2nd March.
Holi is very important. This is the day for Holika Dahan to beat the evil trend.
May this festival be happy in the lives of our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, thanks a lot, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
For the first time in 2018, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you.
Two days back, we celebrated the Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
This programme was attended by the Chief Guests of Hon'ble Supreme Court of 10 countries.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathi.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that women are progressing in every field of India, moving forward and the values of the country are rising.
It is a matter of great pride for the entire world, for the honour and contribution of women in our country since ancient times.
There is a great tradition of great scholars in India.
Several disciples of India have an important contribution in the creation of Vedas.
Lopamuda, Gargi and Maitreyi will be able to take several names.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the entire society and her family in the threshold of unity.
Whether it is a great scholar of Vedic times like Lopamudara, Gargi, Maitreyi or a great wise and devotee like Akka Mahotsav and Meerabai, or a government system like Ahilyabai Thiruvananthapuram or a valour of Rani Lakshmibai, women power is always inspiring us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He has written that the journey made by our Dhadasi Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman through the Sukhoi-30 aircraft inspires him.
Emotionalism, Mohna Singh and Avni Chaturvedi have become three women fighters who are now training in Sukhoi-30.
A few days ago, the Hon'ble President started a new chapter.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed a gathering of women who have performed extraordinary work in their respective fields for the first time.
Our women power has done extraordinary work and established a new record of breaking the chain of traditionalism of the society.
He showed that if there is any difficulty, if there is any difficulty, if there is any hurdle and hard work, if there is a resolve, then it can be done by crossing them and by crossing them, we can create a new path.
Now this path inspires not only our contemporary people but also many generations of the people.
This book is available in the form of 'Narendra Modi Website'.
Today, the women power of this country has a very important role in the positive transformation in the country and society.
Today, when we are talking about women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station here.
Now we must have got the idea of a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Mumbai-Matunga Railway Station.
There are women employees in all the departments in this station.
On seeing the path breaking of the Republic Day, a number of people wrote on the Twitter and other social media that all the women participated in the BSF Bikar Continent.
These women were experiencing very adventurous experiments and they were surprised to see that they were adventurous.
Both words of empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today, our women are leading.
They are becoming self-reliant.
But our tribal women and women of Chhattisgarh have produced a new picture in front of the country.
The campus of Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism.
The emphasis of violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols and the Maoists on the threshold have created a very hot atmosphere here.
In such a dangerous area, tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running e-rickshaws.
The introduction of life of a society is based on whether the system of transformation or improvement has been developed.
Continuous efforts are being made at individual and social levels in our country against social evils, evil practices and practices.
Just a few days back, a good effort was made in Bihar.
In order to completely eradicate social evils, a human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometres was created in the state, which was the longest human chain in the world.
In this campaign people created awareness among the society against evil practices like child marriage and hunting.
The entire state has taken a pledge to fight against evils such as Hunda and Balwant.
Young people, mothers and sisters, all of them participated in this campaign.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan, this human chain was connected to the border of the state.
Our society should be free from such evils, so that all the people of the society need to get the benefits of development.
Let us all take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain.
However, after getting information about Jan Aushadhi Kendras, he has started buying medicines from there and now his father's medicine cost has come down by 75.
This gives huge financial assistance to the common man, especially the senior citizens who are suffering from drug addiction.
The generic medicines being purchased are similar to the standards set by the World Health Organization.
This is the reason why good quality medicines can be made available at affordable prices.
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides cheap medicines but also provides new employment opportunities to the individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and at Amrit Stores of Hospitals.
All these schemes are aimed at providing affordable and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country, which will create a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Yut Mangesh has sent a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App from Maharashtra.
My focus on the separation of this photo will be on it.
In this photo, a grandson along with his brothers participated in the Clean Moon River Cleanliness Mission.
I got to know that the people of Akola have started a programme to clean the 'Morna River' in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Another difficult thing is that in the character of the river wild grass and hydroelectricity was blown up.
Waste and dirt were being thrown at a large scale on the rivers and its banks.
The villagers constructed an artificial framework and constructed a Swachh Morna Mohim on January 13, before Makar Sankranti, according to which, in the first phase, two bays of river Morna were cleaned at four places in four kilometers area.
I have come to know that till now the river Morna is not completely cleaned, Akolkar will continue this campaign every Saturday morning.
This shows that if a person decides to do something, then something is impossible.
It can bring about a big transformation through a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of talk about Padma Awards and you must also hear it.
Every year there is a tradition of awarding Padma awards but the entire process of award has been changed for the last three years.
Now any citizen can give a name for this award.
This entire process has become transparent due to online.
Now the importance of the work done by that person is being taken care of and introduced to the awardee.
You must have heard that you will be happy to know the work of Arvind Gupta ji.
Aurobindo ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has spent his life in making sports for small children.
They are constantly trying to find out the science of use of waste and waste products to the children.
For this, he went to three thousand schools across the country and showcased the paintings made in 18 different languages and inspired children.
This is the story of Karnataka's Sitawa Jodhatti.
They are not addressed as the goddess of women empowerment.
For the past three decades, Sitawa has been a major contributor to transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
He had himself dedicated himself as Devdasi in the seventh year of his age, but Sitava spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdasi.
Not only this, he has also done a great job for the welfare of Dalit women.
You might have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh and Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor, tribal family.
He used to do a simple job for potholes, but he had a mood of painting and painting traditional tribals.
It is because of this verse that he has not only received honour in India but also in the entire world.
His paintings have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The Padma Shri award has been conferred on him by recognising the talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who has named India abroad.
He has built more than five hundred trees on the basis of his memories.
He has been honored with the Padma Shri award for his social work by discovering and discovering such fame persons.
Today, I am happy to mention another name here that the 75-year-old sister of West Bengal Mistri has also been selected for the Padma Awards.
Subhasini Mistri, the woman sold utensils and vegetables in the houses of others to build hospitals.
He was inspired to build a hospital for the poor due to this crisis in his life.
Today, free medicines are being provided to thousands of poor people in the hospitals created by their tireless efforts.
The Padma Puraskar is a medium and I would like to tell the countrymen that those who work for the society around us, those who live for the society, those who dedicate their lives to the society, those who work for a specific purpose, those who work for the entire life, sometimes they should be brought to the society.
Such people do not work at all for honor.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas every 9th January.
Revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India on 9th January from South Africa.
On this day, we are celebrating a festival of immense bonds between Indians living in India and around the world.
You will be happy to know that the Mayor of Indian origin from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Briton, Suriname, South Africa and the United States and many other countries, had participated in this programme.
I would like to thank the European Union for giving this information to the people of the world through a remarkable work, identifying the people of the original Indian origin and through the direction.
The 30th of January is the death anniversary of Bapu who showed us a new path.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, be it India or Duniya or the individual or the family or society.
Namaskar
This is the last anniversary of Mann Ki Baat and see Yoga today is also the last day of the year 2017.
In the entire year, we talked about a lot of things together and shared a lot of things.
Innumerable letters, reactions from you for Mann Ki Baat, exchange of views from them would always give me new energy.
This year is going to change in a few hours, but it will continue to be like this.
In the coming year too, we will interact on new topics and share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on 25th December, the festival of Christmas was celebrated all over the world with great enthusiasm.
We can also see the essence of service in the Bible.
The Sun of Main Hase Low, Not to B Sarhad, But to Sarah, And to Give Hij Life, Age Blace To All Humankind.
These beneficiaries show the importance of service, greatness and greatness.
Whether there is any religion or tradition in this world, but the invaluable form of humanity is introduced by this spirit of service.
In our country, we are talking about "innocence" and "deservation".
We are also called 'Service Paro Dharma'.
Life-service is Shiva-Seva and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans have said that livelihood should be served with emotions.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji's bravery and auspicious life are inspiring for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and he also lived on the basis of the same values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji has inspired people in all such roles as Guru, poet, philosopher, great warrior.
He fought against tyranny and injustice.
He gave the people the teachings of ethnic and religious bonds.
In all these endeavours, he felt a lot on personal level.
But he never gave up his spirituality.
He continued to preach love, sacrifice and peace every moment in his life.
This shows how great and special his personality was.
On the occasion of 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji, I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to participate in the Prakash Festival organised at Patna Sahib.
One January, 2018.
You will be surprised to know that the New Year will come and one January will also come every year.
But when I say "specific" then that thing is really special.
And urge all of us to register our names as voters.
The entire India is keen to welcome itself as a voter in the 21st century.
Being a voter in the 21st century, we must also feel that we have got a respect.
Our opinion is the basis of 'New India'.
This is the biggest strength of vote in democracy.
This is the most effective tool for bringing about positive changes in the lives of millions of people.
We just have the right to vote.
So, what kind of India should we be in the 21st century
You will also be able to become the builder of India in the 21st century and it will start from January 1.
I am confident that the dream of 'New India' will be realised by the zeal of skills for this energetic youth.
Whenever we talk about New India, it should be free from poisonous poisons like casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
He should be free from untouchability and poverty.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India should be our guide power.
Let the youth of New India come forward and discuss how a New India should be.
They should also set a path for us and those who have been associated with it will become such a big group.
We should continue to move forward and the country will also move forward.
When I was talking to you now, I had an idea in my mind that can we organize a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Whether the youth of the age group of 18 to 25 years can come together to discuss the issue of 'New India' and find various ways and plan the same way
How can we fulfil our resolutions before 2022
What can we do to build India in the dream of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi gave the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, today the need of the hour is that we should also create a mass movement for a grand India in the 21st century.
Today, innumerable opportunities have been created for the youth.
Our youth are coming forward from skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship and are also successful.
I believe that we should create an independent robust system by considering how the youngsters of New India can get the information about these schemes.
My dear countrymen, I had told you about the importance of positive in Mann Ki Baat last time.
Any work is easily possible for those who have positivity and enthusiasm.
People in English say: In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had called upon the countrymen to share the positive moments we experienced in the year 2017 and welcome them in a positive environment in 2018.
People gave a very positive response to the social media, MaiGov and Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Some people have made special achievements in their personal lives and have also shared them.
My name is Meenu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One and Delhi.

My name is Dipanshu Ahuja.
I salute Mohalla Sadatganj in Saranpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a very serious problem of water in our area and forty years we depended on the waterways of Armi.
Now we have become free waterways.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy that comes from such small things, let us take a firm resolve to move forward from a positive India to a forward-looking India.
Now we are all talking about positiveness, so I am also keen to tell you one thing here.
Recently, I am very encouraging to know about Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, who has been ranked amongst the top executive services in Kashmir.
He was the first to visit the Kashmir Administrative Service Exam from the atmosphere of terrorism and terrorism.
He wrote the story of success with his own hands.
Today Anjum has become an inspiration not only for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjuman has proved that however evil the situation may be, through positive action, the frustration and destruction of despair can be done.
Recently, in the last week, I got the opportunity to meet some people of Jammu and Kashmir.
I used to talk about the vision of the will power and enthusiasm that was there in them.
In what field he wanted to progress in his life, he used to say that it was a world-class manufacturer with a lot of hope.
I felt that there was no disappointment between them.
They had enthusiasm, joy, enthusiasm, energy, great dreams and resolutions.
I got a lot of inspiration from them as I spent my time with these Kashmiri daughters.
This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to know about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala not only in our country but also in the famous religious places of the world.
Millions of devotees come every year to bless Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world famous temple.
P.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every traveller understands a part of the worship of God and works smoothly.
Now no one has any big celebrity, no matter how rich or very big, everyone is participating in this 'Punyam Punakvanam' programme like a common traveler.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
There is also a strong resolution of cleanliness along with hard survivors.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, on the occasion of the revered Bapus birth anniversary, all of us have together made a pledge to make 'Swachh Bharat' free from untouchability.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
The participation of people in rural and urban areas is also showing change.
The worlds largest Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March 2018 to assume the success of the Swachhta Mission in the urban areas.
Such surveys will be conducted in more than four thousand cities of the country and around 40 crore population.
It will be explained in this regard whether the city is free from open defecation, waste collection, waste transport system, waste management or the efforts made to change the habits of the people, how much people are involved in this work, how many innovations are being used for capacity building and cleanliness.
During this survey, various road cities will be tested.
They are talking to the citizens and knowing their reactions.
The Swachhata App is being used and will be analysed for improving different types of services.
This is not just the government's task of keeping cleanliness.
It is also a great responsibility to maintain cleanliness of every citizen and civil society.
And I urge every citizen to participate in the Swachhata Survey in large numbers.
And you should make a pledge that your society should not lag behind in terms of cleanliness.
You must have had the habit of classifying dry waste and wet waste. I believe that you will be using dust and green potatoes.
Reduce, Reuse and Re-cycle principles are very effective for handholding.
If the population of our city is more than one lakh, the population of the entire country is more than one lakh and if there is less than one lakh population then we should have the highest number of regional orders.
And we should also make efforts.
And all of us must have a dream of your city- our effort, our progress and progress.
Let us once again commemorate the revered Bapu and commemorate the efforts to fulfil the resolution of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that seem to be very small but if we look at it as a society then it becomes our identity.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
I was told that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go to 'Mahram' or her male child.
Specially, such bonds, rules and regulations are not in Islamic countries.
But in India, only Muslim women did not get this right.
And I am very happy to be here that our governments should take care of this thing.
I have full faith and I firmly believe that the journey of India's development will continue to grow on the strength of our women and power, on the confidence of their rivalry.
And that is why our constant efforts should be made so that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities with men. And we need to move forward on the path of progress with women and men.
My dear countrymen, 26 January is a historic festival for us.
This year, 26th January 2018 will be remembered with special significance.
This year, on the occasion of Republic Day celebrations, all the ten ASEAN leaders will come to India as chief guests.
This year, there will be 10 main guests, not one on the Republic Day.
The year 2017 was special in terms of both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and in 2017, Indias partnership with ASEAN completed 25 years.
It is a matter of pride for all of our Indians to join these great leaders of 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, the days of festivals are going on and our country is a country of festivals in a way.
Perhaps no such day can be said that no festival is celebrated that day.
May the coming New Year bring a lot of happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us all move forward with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new joy and new resolve.
This month, Makar Sankranti is celebrated in the month of January, which is associated with Nature.
In Rajasthan, Sankranti is called Magh-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu.
All these festivals are usually celebrated on 13th 17th January.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now we are going to talk about this again in 2018.
Indian citizens will not be able to discover that they do not have respect for them.
That age is greater than all of us and those witnesses of different phases and different periods of the country.
I had the privilege of interacting with Deepawali before departing for a foreign visit.
It was a lovely interaction with us in such a way that we should speak with a small voice.
I don't really carefully talk about such personal conversations.
Listen to the fact that even on this trend of life, Latadi is eager for everything related to the country.
The spirit of satisfaction in his life is connected with India's progress, with a changing India, with a new height of progress.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I was in the air travel.
Lata ji: Good, good.
What to celebrate the birthday.
And what we have achieved has been achieved through the medium of resources and penance.
I am not really anything.
Lata ji: Ho
I also get your letters and I also get your visits.
I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see how much work you are doing and how many things you have to think about.
Modi ji: My mother was very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: But I am soon young.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for several weeks.
Your homes will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of the happiness of these festivals.
The darkness under the wall is called.
Maximum of these words are not just words, but it is an order for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
When we come to our homes with sweets, clothes and gifts, we should go out for a moment.
And if we dont use the things that are more than the requirements of our house then we must do the work of providing such things to the needy outside.
In many cities, several such organizations work with the start-ups of young colleagues.
They collect clothes, cereals and food items from the houses of the people and discover them and deliver them to them.
The joy of laughing at the faces of many poor families will bind our joy of sanctity, we will be able to glow more on our faces, our lamps will be more illuminated and our lamps will grow even more.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi is welcomed as a traditional home in Diwali in the form of good fortune and prosperity.
Can we welcome Laxmi in a new way this year
In our culture, daughters have been regarded as Lakshmi because they bring good fortune and prosperity.
Can we organize honourable programmes for girls in our society, villages and cities this year
Can we do this programme in Diwali for the honour of these Laxmis of India
There are many daughters around us who are doing extraordinary work.
If someone is doing the job of teaching the poor children, someone is doing the job of creating awareness about cleanliness and health, someone is serving the society by becoming a doctor or engineer, while trying to provide justice to someone.
Our society should identify such people, honour them and take pride in them.
The programme of such honour should be held across the country.
One more thing can be done.
Share more information through social media and use Bharat ki Laxmi hashtag for the success of these daughters.
We had launched this great Selfie with the daughter and the world had spread it, in the same way, we would also like to say that India's Laxmi should also be Mohim Rabbu.
Promoting this initiative of Laxmi of India means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had just said that Mann Ki Baat had a great advantage of the programme that I had the privilege of communicating directly or indirectly with many familiar and unique persons.
A few days ago, Alina Tayang, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, has sent me a letter and he has written in it, I read that letter before you.
I live in Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This year, when I was enjoying my examination, some people asked me if you read this book with Exam Warriors.
I told them that I have not read this book.
But again I bought this book and read it two-three times.
After that my experience was very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before examining it, I would have benefited a lot.
I believe that if you think about the new spirit of this book then you must include some other mantras for the parents and teachers and some other mazkurs.
I am extremely grateful to you all for reading this book twice or thrice.
My small friend has also empowered me to do something.
I must follow our orders.
I will certainly try to write something for the parents and the teachers in this book when it comes to the new spirit of this book.
But I urge all of you to help me in this work
What are your experiences in the world
I once again express my gratitude to this young friend of Arunachal, the student of Alina Tyang.
My dear countrymen, through the newspapers, through television, you will get to know about the programmes for the Prime Minister of the country.
But you are aware that I too am a common man like you, a common citizen. And that is why the impact of things on an ordinary life also affects me in my life, because I am also one of you.
Then I also heard that speech and also saw a fight.
Just a short while ago, 19 times before the address, the Grand Slam Patker and the Emperor of the Tennis world, Rafael Nadal, were overwhelmed in the final tour.
The visitors present there welcomed him with enthusiasm to speak .
He also commended the Daniel winner Nadal, how Nadal has inspired youngsters to play tennis.
Even after being defeated in the face of temptation, he commended his rival Nadal and put a good example of sportsmanship in front of the world.
In fact, on the other hand, winner Nadal also praised Daniel's sports.
There is a lot to learn from every section and every person of the age group.
These are moments, whether they win or beat, when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The idea of our ancestors was really compassionate.
Students like Hartin Nancy Kasya Manujya Manujsya Mani Kanchan Sanyog: Janayati Loksya Lochan Andham, when eligibility and humility in a person simultaneously, will that person not win the right mind of anyone
In fact, these young sportspersons have won the hearts of all the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say is really going to be for our good.
The debate will continue, the differences in the parties will persist, but if some things are stopped before they are spreading at a rapid pace then it will be of great benefit.
It becomes difficult to stop the things that go on growing at a rapid pace.
But initially, if we are awakened and stopped then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, today I feel like talking to my dear youngsters.
You all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful for the health and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction .
Because of the nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in them .
Because of its consumption in adolescence there is adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I want to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that the restrictions on e-rickshaws were imposed in India at the earliest.
ECG is such an electronic appliance different from regular calories .
Because of the heat of nicotine substance in cigarette a kind of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is consumed .
We may be aware of the dangers of always cigarettes, but a guarantee about e-cigarettes has been spread that there is no danger due to e-cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals are used so that other cigarettes do not spread its dirt.
We have observed that in many households, children are chainsmokers, but they stop and stop others from smoking.
It is a different matter of E-China.
If someone smokes around us then he understands us from his place.
Even if there is a smoke of cigarettes in someone's pocket then he understands only from Vasar .
However, it is not a matter of fact that many youngsters and youngsters are proud to be fashion statements and sometimes in their books, in their papers, in their pockets, e-cigarettes in their hands and then become depressed.
Young generation is the future of the country.
These types of intoxications have been imposed on calories so that they cannot be used to quench their youth.
These restrictions have been imposed so that the dreams of the family can not be saved, the lives of the children should not be applied to the countrymen, the habit of intoxication should not spread in the society.
I urge all of you to leave this addiction of tobacco and do not take any precautions about EC.
Let us together build a healthy India.
You remember Fit India, aren't you
Fit India does not mean that we should go to the gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
Fit India will have to stay away from all these addictions too.
My dear brothers and sisters, Our India has been the birthplace and workplace of many immense people who have spent their lives for the welfare of the country and others.
India is the birthplace of many such exceptional people. And these are the people who have sacrificed their lives not only for themselves but also for the welfare of others.
One such great person will be honored on October 13 in Vatican City.
It is a matter of great pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will proclaim the 13th of October as a saint.
The work that Mr. Marium Thresia has done for the welfare of mankind in the short life of just 50 years is a unique example for the entire world.
He was very happy about the social service and education sector.
He built several schools, arches and orphanages.
He established the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family which is fulfilling the values and values of their lives even today.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and convey my heartfelt congratulations to the Indian people, especially our brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not for the whole of India but for the entire world that while we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have pledged to be free from single use plastic.
Today, the eyes of the countries of the world are being implemented towards India by looking at the leadership that India has taken in the direction of environment protection.
I am confident that you will be participating in the mission to be free from single-use plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way. However, a youth of our country has started running a mission in a unique way.
When I noticed his work, I interacted with him on a telephone and tried to know his new experiment.
Perhaps the conversation with them will be useful for some other people of the country.
Shri Yut Ripudman Belliji is making a unique effort.
When I heard the word 'plogging' for the first time, it was also new to me.
You are playing this entire programme in an innovative way and particularly in a way that you will like the youth.
I convey my best wishes to you.
Friends, The Ministry of Sports is also organizing Fit India Plogging Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of respected Bapu.
Plaguing two kilometers on October 2.
This programme will be organized across the country.
We have heard from the experience of repudiation of how to do this programme, what to do in the programme.
Through this campaign, awareness about cleanliness is also increasing along with public awareness about health.
I believe that if 130 crore Indians take a step towards freeing single use plastic, then India will move 130 crore steps at the same time.
Repudman ji, once again thank you very much.
I convey my best wishes to you, to all of you and to all of you.
I want to tell you a little bit about one thing.
In fact, I would surely tell you about the next episode of Mann Ki Baat programme in detail, but today I have been asking you to get the opportunity to prepare.
You must remember that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary is on 31st October.
So we should start preparations for that.
There is a lot of time to talk about this.
Some people can start Sarava and some other schemes will also be formulated.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022, we should visit the shrines of India.
Please do the programme of smooth conduct of nights and nights.
Let us see India, understand, experience it.
We have this diversity.
And when people come on holidays on the occasion of Diwali, they definitely go to tour, so once again I urge you to visit any corner of India.
My dear countrymen, on 27th September, the World Tourism Day was celebrated and some of the responsibilities of the world present a series of tourism programmes and you will be happy to know that Indias position has improved in the competitive mandate of tourism.
And this has become possible only because of the cooperation of all of us, especially because of the importance of tourism.
If we do more, we will certainly get top positions in the world's main tourist destinations when we complete 75 years of our independence.
Enjoy and enthusiasm should also be there.
Our festivals are celebrated collectively and celebrated collectively, so that the culture also gets a new strength of collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
The Times Group's Vijay Karnataka newspaper launched a programme in which he urged the children to send letters to the Prime Minister.
He has also written that if children give more information about naturopathy then they will be useful in future in terms of environment protection.
Laxmeshwara's daughter, Rida Nadaf, has written that she is the son of a soldier in the army and she feels proud of it.
Who cannot proud of the soldiers of the army
And it is natural for you to be proud of what you are like.
Irfan Begum from Kalburgi has said that his school is at a distance of 5 km from his village, so he has to come out of his house early and he is also eager to return home.
He has informed that he does not have much time to play with his friends, he should have a school near his house.
Friends, I got the opportunity to save this letter from me.
This was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1949, this day, the Constituent Assembly had accepted the event of India.
On 26th January, 1950, the implementation of the Constitution was initiated and that is why we celebrate 26th January as the Republic Day.
The kingdom of India is the soul of our democracy.
This day is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
He spent nearly three years of hard work to create a constitution.
Any area of life, no subject of nature has emerged from it.
Equality and sensitivity to all is the identity of our kingdom.
It is our duty to follow the letters of our kingdom.
Be it citizens or administrators, everyone should follow the Constitution.
It is a message of state defamation that no one should be harmed.
The Massuda Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of that Committee.
He used to play a very big role.
He spoke of the welfare of every section of the society.
On 6th December, we remember him on his Mahaparinirvana Day.
Baba Saheb has a great contribution in making the country prosperous and empowered.
15th December is the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel, the son of the farmer, who made identities like iron male, also performed a unique task of binding the country in a uniform framework.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Legislative Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
However, the country cannot forget that the terrorist attack on Mumbai on 26-11 days today, nine years ago.
The country remembers those brave men, police and security guards who lost their lives today.
The country will never forget their sacrifices.
It has been decorated to destroy the human power.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to enrich our social structure by weakening it.
And that is why the need of the hour is to be more aware of the humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on December 4, we will celebrate the Naval Day.
The Indian Navy protects its maritime edges.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our culture has developed in the coastal areas of the rivers.
Be it Indus river, river Ganga or river Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important in both economic and strategic aspects.
These are the gates for the entire world.
This country and our land have an intimate relationship with the oceans.
When we look at history, 800-900 years ago, the boats of Raaj kings used to be used in the most capable boats during the Raaj dynasty.
During the extension of the Raajma Masjid, the Naudla Singh of his navy was insisting on bringing the Nawabs into the form of economic superstition at that time.
Several examples of Raam Naudla's campaign and research journey are still available in Sangam literature.
Most of the ships in the world have been permitted to include women in the later times.
However, Raam Naudla and that too 800-900 years ago women had played the role of pearls.
Women were also involved in the war.
The Royal rulers had the latest knowledge of ship building.
How can we forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his boat when the boat is mentioned
The territory of Konkan, situated in the maritime version, was included in the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several tourist resorts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjeera and Golden Durg associated with Shivaji Maharaj were in the sea shore or were standing in the sea .
The boats of Marathas were protecting these forts.
The Martians included large and small boats.
Their naval personnel were capable of attacking any enemy and protecting themselves from the casualties.
It is impossible to mention Maratha Armaan and Kanhoji Angra.
He gave the Arma of Martials a new grandeur and laid the foundation stone of Martian soldiers at many places.
Even after independence, the Indian Navy has performed ceremonially.
Whether it is the Goa Mukti Sangram or the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.
The Navy's INS Sumitra helped in quick rescue and supplied several fishermen safely out of water to Bangladesh.
This year, in the month of May-June, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka, three boats of our boat reached there quickly and they helped the government and the people there.
The warship of our navy INS Hariyal had helped human beings in Rohingyasandarbha in Bangladesh.
In the month of June, the Papua New Guinea government gave us the SOS message and helped us save the fishermen of their fishing boats.
On 21st November, the INS Trikand of our navy flew on a merchant vessel in the West Gulf.
This is a day of pride and respect for the security forces of the country and this year the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special drive from 1st to 7th December.
The entire week, the children, the elders, all of them put the national flag.
A movement should be organized to honour the soldiers across the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flag of the Army.
Our mothers and sisters, if anyone in our familiarity is related to the soldiers, then their experiences, their hard work, their paintings and photographs can be posted at the Hashtag Armed Forcesflagday.
They will be able to get more information about the work of the army by inviting people from schools and colleges.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about the tourists.
This is also an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all the soldiers of our defence forces.
This fund is used for the welfare of the soldiers, the wounded soldiers and for their rehabilitation through the Sainik Welfare Board.
Today, let us also contribute to raising the morale of our armed forces.
We should also put our hands on their welfare.
My dear countrymen, 5 December is World Soil Day.
I want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters too.
Soil means soil is an important element of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Just imagine what will happen if there is no nutritious soil in the world
How is life tight damar
This was discussed a long time ago in our culture and that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, the feeling of devotion towards agriculture, soil and respect was natural in the minds of the people and at the same time many scientific methods used to nurture the soil.
Two things have great importance in the lives of the farmers of this country, their devotion to our soil and their scientific perspective.
We all feel proud that the farmers of our country are connected with traditions and are also aware of modern science.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj Block and the farmers of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used chemical fertilizers in an unbalanced manner, so that the soil quality there was reduced.
Production has come to an end, thereby reducing the income of the farmers and the productivity of the soil.
Some awakened farmers of the village were familiar with the situation and after that the farmers of the village tested their soil, the amount of fertilizers, nutritional salts and biological fertilizers they were advised to use.
You will be surprised to know that the guidance provided to the farmers through soil health cards has shown positive results.
In 2016-17, the production of cow dung increased by three to four times and the income also increased by four to six thousand rupees.
If we take care of pickle then we should take care of the soil and if we take care of the mother of the dam then it will also take care of us.
More than 10 crore farmers across the country have prepared soil health cards so that they can get better information about their soil.
We worship the mother of the dam but did you think of how difficult they are for the health of this dammala like urea
More than necessary urea causes damage to the soil, it has been proved by many scientific experiments.
The farmers are the sons of this dam mother and how can they make her mother sick
The need of the hour is to revive this relationship between mother and son.
Can our farmers make a pledge to utilize urea for our farming by 2022, that is, 75 years of our independence
Once upon a time, the sons and daughters of the dam mother had made a solemn pledge that the health of the dam and the soil will be improved rapidly and the production will also increase.
There will be a change in the lives of the farmers in the true sense.
We are now experiencing the changes in the environment.
There was a time when the winter had started just before Diwali.
Now it has come to December and it is getting very cold.
It is our experience that we don't feel like getting out of the throats.
However, even in such a weather, people with awareness work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
But the determination and determination were greater and stronger.
Eight-year-old son was unable to speak, but he took the help of a slap.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, this son used to go to the house of the village and ask him not to do anything on the open.
This pottery village has become Open Defecation Free due to the efforts of this child who taught cleanliness everyday in 30-40 houses.
Every moment we get to learn something new.
Today they are performing well in every field.
Whether it is sports, competitions, social initiatives, our disabled persons do not lag behind in any case.
You all remember, in the Rio Olympics competition, our disabled sportspersons had earned 4 medals in their best sports, and the World Council for the T-Twenty Cricket of Blind.
There are several types of competitions across the country.
A few days ago, 17th National Para Water Conservation Competition was organised in Udaipur.
They do not have meat in 80 percent of their body but see their meat, resolve and affection.
He also won the Golden Jubilee in the 70th National Para Water Conservation Competition and was selected by the Sports Authority of India for 20-20 Paralympics.
They include 32 Para waterfalls and all will be trained at the Excellence Centre in Gujarat.
I convey my greetings and best wishes to the young Jigar Thakkar.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day the Prophet Hajrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
I extend my warm greetings to all my fellow citizens and hope that this festival of Eid will inspire all of us to enhance peace and harmony in the society.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Neerja Singh from Kanpur.
I request you to once again tell us the best of the things that you have said through Mann Ki Baat throughout the year, so that we can recall those things and we can learn more new things.
We have made very good information.
After listening to your speech, I want to change it even more.
The old people who live in our villages always tell us, forget the grief, do not forget the happiness.
Whether it is photographs, short stories, or in small sound images, I invite you to welcome the year 2018 in a grand atmosphere, we have to do it with good memories and with positive ideas.
On Narendra Modi App, on MyGov or on social media, share positive aspects with Positive India.
Refresh the incidents that inspire others.
We all see the strength and impact of these collective efforts together.
I will certainly try to reach out to the people of the country in the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I once again interact with you all for Mann Ki Baat next month.
Many things will get the opportunity to speak.
Many thanks
Six days after Deepawali is one of the best celebrations of our country.
In which traditional rules are being followed from diet to washing.
Anupam Parva of Chhath Puja is completely associated with the supremacy of nature and nature.
The sun and water are the centres of the sixth edition, while bamboo and soil-made utensils and candles are useful in this worship.
Duniya worships growers, but in Chhath Puja, he also commends us to worship them, whose movements are certain.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also inherent in this era.
Cleanliness of the entire house, along with rivers, ponds, shores, shores and pujas, all the people are very enthusiastic.
Suryavandana or Chhathpuja is the backbone of prevention, disease prevention and recommendation.
Generally, we should eat something, this is a small thing, we should understand the feeling of inferiority
But in Chhath Puja after midnight, after asking for Prasad, this is a special tradition.
This is the reason why Prasad was asking for food that the ego is destroyed and the ego is such a feeling that the progress of the individual is stagnant.
It is very natural that the people of this great tradition of India are proud.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am convinced that Mann Ki Baat has been constructed in 100 per cent of the Mann Ki Baat with the public opinion of the country.
Take the examples of Khadi and Handloom.
I always appeal to Gandhi Jayanti for handloom, khadi and you will be happy to know what is the result.
I was told that on 17th October this month, a record sale of Rs. 1 crore twenty five lakhs was recorded at Khadi Gramodyog Bhawan Store in Delhi.
You might be happy to know that Khadi and Handloom are sold at such a large scale in a single store.
During Deepawali, the sale of khadi gift coupons has increased by nearly 680.
The sale of khadi and handicraft items has also increased by nearly 90 percent this year as compared to last year.
Today, youngsters, elderly, women and people from all walks of life like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine the benefits of this business to the poor families and the families working on handlooms.
But, from the experience of the past few years, I can say that Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion have now taken the place of Khadi for Transformation.
Khadi has become a means of empowering the poorest of the poor by bringing about a change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role for Gramodyog.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he wanted to know about the experiences of my security forces and he wanted to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gayakwad also spoke on the Narendra Modi App whether the sweet security forces of our arms can be arranged
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweetness of our house should reach the soldiers of the country.
We must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali has brought a special experience for me too.
I salute every soldier of the security forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of the security forces who fought against the border with difficulty and torture.
Whenever we get time, we get vacancies then we should know the experiences of the soldiers and take pride in them.
Many of you do not know that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also playing an important role in world peace.
Everyone knows the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace throughout the world and their positive geography.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is my family in the world.
With this belief, India has been active in various UN initiatives since the beginning.
You all are aware that both the words of the Woe The Piple were published in India's introduction and the introduction of the UN Charter.
India has always emphasized on women equality and the UN declaration on human rights is the same live example.
The Proposal made in his Initial Frame was changed by the efforts of Indian representative Hansa Mehta and later accepted the All-Human Bingj R Barne Free and Equal.
If you look at it then it changes a little, but a powerful thought was seen from it.
India's role in the UN Peacekeeping Operations has been a major contributor to the UN.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
In the current situation, seven thousand soldiers were added to UN Peacekeeping and this is the third highest in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served in 50 operations in 71 piecekeeping.
This effort of peace came from some countries like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Cango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, 20 thousand patients were treated in the Indian Army's hospital and saved the people from the numerous.
The Indian security forces have not only protected the people of different countries, they have also won their hearts.
Indian women have also played an important role in making peace.
India is the only country that very few people know that India has sent women police units to the Peace-Abhiyan Mission in Liberia.
And this step of India will inspire the countries of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
We will be proud to hear that India's role is not only related to the Shanti Abhiyan but also in 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our Bahadur Peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peace-Abhiyan, this is not an easy task.
Our security guards have to go to the far-flung areas and do this.
His memory blossoms the glory of every countryman.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, the brave man who was honored with Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji made a special identity in Cyprus.
In 1989, in the 72nd year he was appointed as a Force Commander for Operations and he served the nation for its independence.
Gen Thimayya, who was the head of the Indian Army, also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and laid the foundation stone for peace.
India has always given the message of peace, unity and harmony as a peace messenger.
We believe that everyone should move ahead with the vision of peace, harmony and a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has been decorated with such great personalities who have served humanity with a sense of selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call sister Nivedita, is also one of these immense people.
He was born in Ireland as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name Nivedita.
Nivedita means fully dedicated
Later, he proved himself in accordance with the name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
The work of Swami Vivekananda was so impressed that he sacrificed his happiness and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita, the oppressors in the British Raj were very much disturbed.
The British not only made our country a rose but they also tried to make us mentally retarded.
Our culture has been less written in the form of inferiority and emotions.
Brothers and sisters, Nivedita ji re-established the glory of Indian culture.
He worked to keep people together by awakening the national consciousness.
He went to various countries across the globe and raised his voice against the opponents of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is known for his revolutionary poetry Pudumri Penn, New Year and Women's Empowerment.
It is believed that his inspiration was sister Nivedita.
Brothers and sisters, Niveditaji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Basu helped in research and propaganda through his writings and coordination.
This is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
This is the best example of Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
In 1899, a plague was made in Kolkata and hundreds of people lost their lives.
Sister Nivedita did not take care of her health and started cleaning the roads.
She was such a woman who could lead a comfortable life but she was associated with the service of the poor.
People took inspiration from them and helped them in service work.
He taught people about cleanliness and service through his work.
Speaking on the occasion, he said, "Heer Reposition Cister Nivedita Hu Gave every All-to-India is resting here, who gave all to India.
Indeed, he did this.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children of my first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on his birth anniversary.
These are the heroes of building a New India.
In the last stages of the life of the disease, they are now seen in small children as well.
Youngsters also used to suffer from this disease.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are now known as lifestyle disorders.
In youngsters, there should be such diseases i . e . reduction in physical activity and change in dietary practices .
Societies and families need to pay attention to these things.
When we think about it then we will realise that there is no need to speed up anything.
There is only a need to change your habits by regulating the right ways and by changing your habits.
Instead of going to the lifton the children should adopt the habit of climbing up the zina .
After dinner, try to walk with the entire family.
Yoga for Young India
This Yoga, especially our young friends, will be able to achieve a sustainable lifestyle and to avoid lifestyle disorders.
In the past 30 minutes, the specialty of Yoga is that Yoga is easy and universal.
And I would like to tell you that Yoga can easily be done by any person in the field of Yoga.
It is easy for us to learn simple methods and to do everything possible.
There is no need for special resources and fields for that.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been good reports in the last few days in the field of sports.
Our sportspersons have emerged in different fields.
India won Asia Cup hockey trophy in Hockey.
Our sportspersons performed the best games and India became Asia Cup champion after 10 years.
Earlier, India had become Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to these hockey swings and their friends on behalf of the nation.
After the hockey, there is a trend in badminton too.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has played a crucial role in winning the Denmark Open Trophy.
This is his third Super Series Premiere Award after the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, The FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup will be organised this month.
Several associations from across the globe came to India and showed their talent on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to see a fight.
There was a lot of enthusiasm in the players and sportspersons.
This big event of the World Cup was watching you all over the world.
I am glad to see such a big fight and the energy, enthusiasm and fertility of young players.
The World Cup organised successfully and all the associations performed well.
Even though India did not get a chance, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of everyone.
India and the entire world have enjoyed this festival of sports and this entire competition has become thrilling and entertaining for football lovers.
Footballs are indicative of the future.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the players.
My dear countrymen, I will have to do this programme Mann Ki Baat everyday to justify the feelings of those people who have written to me about Swachh Bharat.
Some youngsters send photographs of their efforts and some of the youngsters are among them.
If there is a story of a new initiative on cleanliness, then the zeal of an officer keeps on changing the mindset.
Just a few days ago, I received a detailed report in which the story of the Kayakalat of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra has been narrated.
A voluntary organisation named Eco-system Protection Organisation has undertaken cleanliness drive at Chandrapur Fort.
In this two hundred-day campaign, people did not stop or tired, they did the work of cleaning the fort.
I was amazed to see the photos and whoever sees this photo, whose minds are disappointed with the virtues of the virtues around him, he might have seen how the dreams of cleanliness will be fulfilled then I would like to tell my people that you can see the live image of the youth of the Eco-Protection Organization, their sufferings and their resolutions.
Your disappointment will change in your belief.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
Guru Nanak Devji is not the first Guru of the Sikhs but he is a Jagadguru.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire humanity, and addressed all castes as equal.
He emphasized on women empowerment and women's dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28 thousand kilometers and during this journey he taught the truth about humanity.
He interacted with the people, showing the path of truth, sacrifice and duty.
He gave the message of social equality and this teaching was not just spoken by him but also by his work.
He started an anchor, which created a sense of service among the people.
The eclipse of unity and equality in the people was awakened by the gathering of food.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of meaningful life - Remember Paramatma, do hard work, work and assist in the need.
Guru Nanak Devji created Gurbani to share his element.
In the coming 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us try to walk on the path of their message and teaching.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October.
You know that he had laid the foundation of an integral modern India.
Today we can learn a lot from the life of this great saint of Mother India.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is that he was not only a transformative thinker, but he was also bent on exploring practical solutions from complex problems to achieve that.
He was skilled in realizing the ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has made India a summit.
It is sure that crores of Indians will be brought under the umbrella of a nation and a constitution.
He empowered them to overcome all the difficulties.
Wherever it was required to be honoured, he respected it.
He used force in the area where the need to use force was created.
He set a goal and resolved with that goal.
It was only possible to keep the country together.
He dreamt of such a nation where all the people should be equal.
I feel that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels ideas are always inspiring.
He said, We cannot stop any discrimination of casteism, all are the daughters of India, we should love the country and we should make a future for each others love and harmony.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and inclusive for the vision of our New India.
And his birth anniversary was celebrated as National Ekta Diwas.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
Dear Countrymen, after Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new resolve, all of us have come to life every day.
Congratulations to my countrymen, let all their dreams come true
Thanks a lot.
My dear countrymen, greet you all
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat through AIR.
Today it is 36th.
Most of them are those who inspire me.
There are many things to improve the government.
There are also some personal complaints.
I take half an hour in a month, but people keep sending their messages on Mann Ki Baat for twenty-four days.
This has resulted in sensitivity in the government.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is an adventurous journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps in such a short span of time I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country and I am very grateful to the countrymen for that.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one thing of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba always used to say that non-governmental, non-governmental are the results.
This thing has been kept away from the political color and instead of being drenched in the subject that has been drenched at that time, instead of being drenched in it, we have tried to connect with us with a stable mind.
I am aware that after three years, social researchers, universities, researchers, intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyze this.
Moreover, I believe that the idea of doing so will prove to be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future.
I had once said in Mann Ki Baat that it should not be eaten while eating. Therefore, it is necessary to take as much food as is needed.
I have seen that I have received letters from every corner of the country in large numbers.
Several social organisations and many youngsters have already been working on this thing.
I got to know that there are many people who have been working for the food processing system and how they can be used collectively.
Once I saw a selfie with the dotor of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I told all of them in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only in India but also in the whole world, such a huge campaign of self-reliance with dotor has started.
This is not just the issue of social media.
Each Kanyala became a new self-confidence, a new pride.
A few days ago, I was talking to the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people going out, wherever you go on the subject of 'Incredible India', photographs were sent and lakhs of photographs were received.
In a way, this is a great achievement for those who work in the tourism sector.
I have experienced this thing because of Mann Ki Baat that how a small event can create a big movement.
I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat for three years. At that time several incidents of last three years have touched my heart.
Every moment is being considered to go the right path of the country.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the other, for the betterment of the society, for the progress of the country.
I have understood and learnt from the countrymen in this three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
I salute the countrymen with all my heart.
I once talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat and said that Khadi is not a cloth but a thought.
Once again I would like to urge you to start the Khadi campaign.
If we buy khadi then we should work with this feeling that we will burn the binoculars in the house of the poor.
This work will give strength to the poor of our country and that is why we should do this.
How can new technologies be brought about, how can we increase production capacity, how can we handle solar power
The idea of how to revive the old 20-20, 25-20-30 years has been closed down.
Now the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh, but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been linked with it.
Many people were provided new employment opportunities.
In Pampore, Kashmir, Khadi and Gramodyog resumed their training centres once again and there is a lot to contribute to Kashmir.
Now this training centre is going to help in modernizing the new generation, cotton marketing and involving new things. I am very happy that whenever they meet the big corporate house, they have recently started providing Khadi goods.
People have also started giving Khadi goods while visiting each other.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our Hon'ble President started this work and the entire nation participated in it.
Whether it is Abal-Vridh, men or women or cities, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness mission today.
Whenever I say, "Sankalp se Siddhi", we all see how this cleanliness mission is moving forward towards a resolution.
Everyone accepts this movement, cooperates and is contributing something or the other to realize it.
I thank the Hon'ble President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has considered it as its work.
It is a matter of great pleasure for me that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people participated in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign and I have seen that some people are continuously working, the results will continue to work till these days.
It is a matter of fact that we have to clean up somewhere, the other thing is that we should not be cautious and we should not be cautious, but if we want to make cleanliness then we also need a ideological movement.
Several competitions have been held this time in collaboration with Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the essay competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of kids took pictures.
Using our imagination, we have taken pictures on the subject of cleanliness.
Several people wrote poems and in these days, I post the pictures sent by our children and children in social media.
I never forget to thank the people of the media when it comes to cleanliness.
These people have carried forward this movement in a very good manner.
They are also leading this Swachhata movement in their own way.
We can see in this Swachhata Hi Seva movement how much of our country's electronic media can serve the country through a printed media.
Just a few days ago, somebody noticed about the 18-year-old newborn Bill Dar of Srinagar.
No, nothing like that.
Bilal Dar works for five to six years of cleanliness from the 12-13 years of his age.
The biggest pond in Asia is near Srinagar, whether it is plastic, polythene, waste or dirt, all these ponds will be cleaned.
Bilal Dar is younger than the age, but it has become an inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the future history is born from the womb of history and when it comes to history, it is natural to remember the great men.
This month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on October 11 and the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on September 25.
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was the center of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left his political career and stayed engaged in the work of Gramodya and it is natural for him to be respected for his village work when he is celebrating his centenary year.
The President of India, Shri Abdul Kalam ji used to talk about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh when he had interacted with the youngsters.
With great respect, he used to mention the work of Nanaji, and he himself went to the villages to see the work of Nanaji.
Deendayal Upadhyay ji used to talk about the last person in the society like Mahatma Gandhi.
Sardar Saheb had brought together the entire country.
Now we should also run for unity and move ahead with the mantra of unity.
We are very simple and naturally saying that unity in diversity is the specialty of India.
We are proud of diversity, but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to reiterate to my countrymen, especially to my younger generation that we are awakening.
There are days of sunrise, Diwali, somewhere in our country, somewhere or the other.
People go out as tourists and it is very natural.
But sometimes it is a matter of concern that our people are not only watching our country but also knowing the diversity of the country.
You must go to the outside country, I don't oppose it, but sometimes we can see the places in our country.
When we look at the life of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our mother, President Abdul Kalam ji, it is a matter of fact that when all of them visited India, they came to India and at the same time they were inspired to live for this country and to sacrifice their lives for this country.
All these great men had made extensive visits to India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
There will be value addition in tourism at a time when we do not go to Paramukh as a mere child, we should go to a student and try to understand his life.
I have got the opportunity to spend the night in more than four and a half hundred districts. And today, when I assist in this great responsibility in India, I am feeling immensely immensely immensely impatient.
There is no time at all.
I appeal to all of you that unity in diversity in this vast India is not just a declaration, it is a barrier to our unconventional power.
How many types of food habits are there in us .
Even if we keep eating a new food all day long, there are so many innumerable ways that the first thing will not come again.
Now, this is a great strength for our tourism.
I believe that if you go out somewhere this time too, you will carry forward my first mission.
You must send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you meet the people there, send their photographs.
There is a thought in my mind that in order to promote tourism in India, what can be the best tourist destinations in our state, every Indian should know about those seven special places in our state.
If possible, it should go to seven places.
Can we provide some information about these places
Can we provide this information on Narendra Modi App
Can we know about Hashtag Incredible India
Just imagine, if all the people in a state start giving good information then I would like to tell the government that they should communicate with the information and prepare propaganda literature about the seven things that have come from every state.
In a way, how can tourist destinations be encouraged by the people's intentions
The Government of India will work on it.
Yes, you should be associated with me.
You can also become a big and important partner in promoting tourism in the country from October to March.
I am inviting you for that.
My dear countrymen, many things touch my mind as a human being.
I feel hungry.
Some things get overwhelmed on my mind.
In the end I am a human like myself.
The Indian Army has got two heroes in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi.
It is a matter of immense pride that both the sisters of Swati and Nidhi had also been martyred in serving Mother India.
You can imagine how the mindset would be if the culture grew up in such a young age
But the letter of Shaheed Karnal Santosh Mahadik, Swati Mahadik, decided to face this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and finished his life to fulfil his dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, his husband Mukesh Dubey was acting as a hero in the army and was martyred for his motherland.
Their wife Nidhi decided that we should be in charge of the army and they fulfilled their determination.
It is natural for every countrymen to have respect for their parental power and their brave hearts.
I heartily congratulate both of these sisters.
My dear countrymen, there has been a great opportunity for the youth of the country in the middle of the festival of Navratri and Diwali.
FIFA World Cup is being held in our country this year under 17 years.
I am sure that the people around will have to hear the announcement of football.
Each generation will have a favorite increase in football.
It will not be possible to see our youngsters playing in the fields of schools and colleges of India.
Friends, The entire world is coming to play on the land of India and we will also make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is time for the worship of Mother Durga.
The entire atmosphere has been covered with sacred fragrance.
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the entire country celebrates the festival, on the other hand, there is a lot of violence in any part of India, then it is natural for the country to worry about it, this is the country of Buddha and Gandhi.
Sardar Patel is the country of those who have sacrificed their lives for the country's listening.
Our forefathers have accepted the values of public life, non-violence with equal respect.
We have heard of 'Ahimsa Paro Dharma' since childhood.
I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that violence will not be used in the name of faith, although it is communal belief or belief in political thinkers, if there is faith in the person, if there is faith in tradition, no one has the right to take the law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the countrymen that the country will never tolerate the laws, those people who suppress the path of violence or groups and no government will tolerate it.
Everyone will have to face the law.
Thousands of years of cultural traditions because of cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, perhaps in 365 days there should not be a single day in which there would not be a single day.
Now we must have seen that our eternal values run according to the nature cycle.
There is a simple relationship with nature .
Most of our years are connected to the farmers.
First of all, I would like to call you Matchami Dukkadam.
Yesterday's festival was celebrated in Jain society.
In the Jain community, the festival festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadrama.
The last day of the festival is the day of sanskar .
This is a unique tradition.
The festival day is a symbol of fortitude, non-violence and friendship.
In a way this is also going on for a fortnight and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other Mishtami Dukkadam .
We have heard about this thing and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the specialty of a strong man.
Shakespeare has written in his drama the importance of efficiency in The Marchant of Venice. "Marcy is two blest, it blest, it should give him the gift and him the takes. And whoever has been empowered, both receive the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great joy in every corner of the country.
When the subject of Ganesh - Chaturthi comes then it is natural to speak on public Ganesh festival .
Ganesh Chaturthi runs for 10 days.
This Mahasana is considered a symbol of unity, equality and goodwill.
My best wishes to all the nation builders on the occasion of Ganesh.
At the same time, Honam was celebrated in Kerala.
Onam is one of the major festivals of Kerala in the diversity of India.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
These days our festivals seem to be the reason for the attraction of tourism.
I would like to tell the countrymen that like the Navratri festival in Gujarat or the Durga Festival in Bengal in a way has become the attraction of tourism.
Our other festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in that direction.
In the series of these festivals, Id-ul-uha festival will be celebrated across the country within a few days.
Happy Id-ul-uha to all fellow citizens.
Sana is a symbol of faith and belief for us.
We have to make our New India a symbol of cleanliness.
In family life, we are connected with cleanliness.
Preparation of Sana means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But there is a need to be a social character.
Cleanliness in the form of public is not just home, but in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country, we must become an integral part of our society.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernisation is changing.
Eco-Friendly Ganapati has been a big campaign.
If you look at the youth tube, then every household is becoming a mother-in-law and we are making a guarantee by bringing the soil.
Someone is colouring the vegetables, somebody is sticking to the papers.
Different types of experiments are being done in every family.
And it seems bad when new experiments are known.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
The toilet has reached nearly 67 points from just 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of the flood was reduced, everywhere there was awakening dirt.
At present, the workers of Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hind in Dhaner, Banaskanth district of Gujarat cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques in a systematic manner.
Autonomous sweat, all the people came out.
The best example of unity for cleanliness, inspiring examples of everyone, was given by all the workers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.
If this becomes our sustainable spirit, then where can our country go
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, the Swachhata Hi Seva was like saying earlier, 'Jal Seva is the Prabhu Seva', 'Swachhta Hi Seva'.
Make the environment of cleanliness in the entire country.
Whenever we get the opportunity, we should explore opportunities.
But we all come together.
On holidays or on Sundays we will come together and work together .
We will go to the nearby areas but we will work with a movement.
I urge all NGOs, schools, colleges, social and cultural political leaders, government officials, artisans and Sarpanches to create an atmosphere of incredible cleanliness for 15 days before Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation MyGov.
In this, a department has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can write your name and the name of the family that you have helped.
My social friends can run some creative campaigns and will actually become an inspiration for the world.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is being organised by the Ministry of Water and Sanitation in which essay competition, short film making competition and painting competition are being organized.
We can write essays in different languages and there is no bond of age in them.
You can make a short film with your mobile.
You can create a 2-3 minute film that will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness mission.
I would like to reiterate that this time, on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti, we should take a pledge to celebrate 'Clean 2nd October' and that is why, since 15th September, this Mantra of Cleanliness will reach home.
Some steps have been taken for cleanliness.
It should be part of it by doing its own hard work.
You see how Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after the 15-day Cleanliness Campaign, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, we will be happy to pay homage to the true revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I want to specially accept my loan today.
I express my heartfelt gratitude and not because we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time.
I get the opportunity to understand the spirit of the people of the country.
I look forward to our message as soon as you look forward to Mann Ki Baat.
I am indebted because I get to learn something from all of you.
I express my gratitude to you all for your contribution.
We are connecting our mobile phones and we become a part of these wrong habits.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed Aparna from Pune.
I would like to tell my friends that they are always trying to help the people but I was tired of seeing a habit of it.
I once went to the shopping mall with it.
We dont make any payment at large, but we harvest our hardworking bondmen and show their distrust.
Do you not think that there is always a relationship between the sellers, the small shopkeepers and the sellers of tea and coffee near our homes, when we come to our relationship with the people of Oto-rickshaws then we feel goods with them.
Not only this, you tell me to pay less than two or five rupees. And we have to go to a big hotel so that even the bill does not pay the money.
The question for him is not Rs.
He was poor and hence he had doubts about his honesty and that he could not change his life by two-five rupees. However, did he ever think of this small habit
Madam, I am grateful to you. You have given me a message by calling the heart touching phone.
I am confident that my countrymen will also give up their behaviour with the poor.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire country is celebrating as National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of great hockey player and hockey architect Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to hockey is incomparable.
I want to remember this thing that I believe that we should connect with the new generations of sports in our country.
Sports should become part of our lives.
If we are young countries of the world, then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports is physical fitness, intellectual sustainability, emotional harmony.
I believe that what should be more than this
In a way, sports is a heaviness connecting the heart.
Our youth should move forward in the field of sports. Today, in the age of computer, I want to tell you that the field of sports is more important than the sports stations.
Play FIFA on the computer but showcase something on the outer field.
The joy of playing cricket on the open ground is different from the cricket on the computer.
There was a time when the kids of the family used to go out and you would be like this.
Today the situation is such that as soon as the children come home, they sit around and watch the games on the mobile and watch the films.
This was the time when the mother said to the child , Have you ever had such a time come that you will never go out .
It is a matter of great pleasure for our youngsters that FIFA World Cup is being organised under the 17th anniversary of October 6-28.
Today, when I was talking about sports, there was an incident in the last week that I would like to tell the people.
I got the opportunity to meet a young girl, some of whom were born in the Himalayas.
Sometimes 30-30 days have been spent in the waters of the sea and this is the first incident in the world by Himmati.
Who will be an Indian who will not be proud of the unbelievable daughters
I salute these daughters and I congratulate them and they will share this experience with all the countrymen.
I will also make available a separate place for the benefit of Narendra Modi.
Because we must read their experiences because it is an adventurous story of adventure, a story of auspiciousness and I am happy that the story of these daughters has reached us.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we celebrate all the teaching days.
The birth anniversary of former President of our country Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President but he was presenting himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
Awakening the joy of creative emotions and knowledge among our students is an important quality of the teacher.
Can we together make a pledge when we celebrate the Teacher's Day
We can enjoy the success of our lives by enjoying our resolutions for five years.
There is such an incident in every teacher's life that his efforts would have changed due to changes in his life.
If we make a collective effort then we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I work for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University, Mumbai.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is a matter of discussion not only of India but also of Pandits across the world.
This scheme was started on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Yesterday, the scheme is being completed by 3 years.
30 crore new families have been linked to bank accounts.
Today, I am glad that the poor people of the society have been made the heir of the economy of the country.
Now there is an atmosphere of restraint.
He feels that money will be used for children.
You can do some good work in the coming days.
Moreover, the poor who sees RuPay card in their pockets feels like Mrs.
He feels a comfortable.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the bank.
This is their strength in the present times and the details of the accounts that have been opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also been removed.
The Prime Minister's Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana has created a lot of faith in the poor today due to this insufficient amount of Rs.
If something happens to the mainstream of the family due to a rupee bill, the family will get Rs. 2 lakh.
Today there is not much time but I will tell the people of the bank to upload it to my gov. in.
My dear countrymen, once again we are sweet.
Thanks a lot.
The human mind is such that he feels very happy in the rainy season.
Pushu, birds, trees, nature and everyone are happy with the arrival of monsoon.
But this rain sometimes spreads in a record form and then it feels that it is even stronger to bring about destruction in water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but sometimes it is terrible to see in the natural calamities of floods and hunger.
Whatever changes are taking place in the changing climate and environment, they have a very negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, the North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, are facing natural calamities due to extreme surge.
The entire area is being monitored.
Be it the soldiers of the army, the people of the air force, the people of NDRF, the executors, all those who are victims of the disaster in such a situation.
Farming, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electrification, connectivity is the result of this.
People are also telling their problems.
We can simply prepare our work records according to the weather conditions so that the potential losses can be avoided.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I can see the citizens of the country preparing more than me.
On this occasion, I have received a lot of letters on the subject of GST, a lot of phone calls have come and people are still very happy about GST and also expressing their happiness.
You will also hear a phone call from it: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I speak from Gurgaon to Nutu Garg.
I have heard the speech of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, in our country this star of last month was started by the GST.
Whether or not the results were received after one month or not, what should we tell Shakal
I want to hear your thoughts about this.
The GST has been implemented for nearly a month and its benefits are also visible.
When a poor person writes to me about how the prices of essential things have been reduced due to GST, how things have become cheap then I feel very satisfied and happy.
What was the reason for not being aware of GST, but now he learns about this thing that how much work seems to be easier than ever before, he wrote somebody living in the forests in the remote mountains of Ishanya.
All these facilities are available, but they are also getting support for the economic momentum of October.
The speed at which this transformation has been made smoothly, the speed at which it has been replaced, the new registration has created an atmosphere of trust in the entire country.
In the field of economics, scholars from the field of management and intellectual research, Indias use of GST is sometimes considered to be an ideal system in the world.
For many universities of the world, this will be a testimony and a case study.
It is a big step to successfully implement this tax in such a vast country with the participation of crores of people.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre together.
Consequently, every government has decided that GST should not be burdened on the cost of foodgrains of the poor.
You are well aware of the fact that the GST App is available on mobile phones, what was the price before GST, what was the price in the new situation.
I congratulate all the ministries, departments, central and state government employees for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of Indias collective powers.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a concept but a system that strengthens a new authentic culture.
In a way, it is also a mission of social reform.
I once again bow down to crores of people of the country for carrying out such a big task in a simple manner.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a way, in the month of August, there have been several such incidents which are associated with the history of freedom.
This year, we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people would be aware that Dr.
Yusuf Meher Ali had given away.
Your new generation should know what happened on 9th August 1942.
Who can be a bigger motivation than this
Indias uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had prepared a pledge to liberate the entire country from British politics.
This was the time when the Indian public opinion against the British rule, every corner of India, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, be it cities or be it cities or be it uneducated or uneducated, be it the poor or the poor, be it Shrimant or be it the people of the country, India had become a part of the Chhoto movement.
Millions of Indians who sacrificed their lives in the struggle by taking the mantra of 'Karo Maro' in response to Mahatma Gandhi's call.
Millions of youngsters of the country had given up their education, had left their books.
The great men like Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan played a key role.
Gandhiji's two different forms are seen in the 'Aadhaar Andolan' and 'Bharat Chhodo Andolan' - 1920 and 1942.
And in 42 years, such a situation has emerged that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karo'.
People were supported, people-powered, people-to-people, people-to-people were behind all these successes.
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I feel that if we look at the leaves of history then India's first freedom struggle was built in 1857.
This freedom struggle started from 1857 till 1942, in which part of the country was going on every moment.
This lengthy period awakened the spirit of freedom in the minds of the countrymen.
Everyone is committed to do something in that direction.
The generations have changed, but the resolutions have not collapsed.
People were coming, connected, expelled, new people came and the country was making every effort to overthrow the politics of the British.
Five years would have been decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today, the year 2017 is going on.
The incident took place about 70 years.
During the period, governments came and gone.
The system has been changed, changed, changed, increased.
Everyone has tried their best to make the country free from problems.
Efforts have been made so that poverty can be overcome and development can be achieved in the country.
Your parents have also suffered in their own way.
Got success too.
It was higher than expected.
It was five years since 1942 to 1947.
Similarly, from 2017 to 2022, I see that the five-year period in the journey of accomplishment is now in front of you.
We should celebrate this 15th August of 2017 as a pavilion of resolutions and when we complete 75 years of independence in 2022, we will complete that pledge.
Today, it is not for this announcement of 'Karenge' but for connecting with this resolution of a New India.
We have to keep this resolution alive and fight.
I would like to run a grand campaign from the resolution to its achievements on 9th August in the month of August.
Every Indian, social organisation, local system, schools, colleges, different organisations, everybody should make a new pledge for New India.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We should become a part of this resolution and today we must not be anywhere else but online.
Therefore, I invite my young friends, especially those who come to the online world, to come forward to contribute in their innovative ways to build a New India.
Using technology, bring all these things like videos, posts, blogs, glasses, new concepts.
Give this mission the form of a mass movement.
uit India uiz will also be launched for young friends on the Narendra Modi App.
This is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country with the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will be able to spread and spread it on a wide scale.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Minister of India, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort.
I am just a representative.
You must send your thoughts on MyGov or on NarendraModiApp.
I read it myself and try to convey this idea in the time I get it on 15th August.
In the last three years, I have heard a complaint about my 15th August speech that my speech is a little longer.
I will complete it in maximum 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And that economist never writes less.
Our festivals are not just a matter of joy and happiness.
Our festivals, our festivals are also the means of social reform.
At the same time, we have a direct relationship with the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
In a few days, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, after that Ganeshotsav, the fourth moon, after that Anant Chaturthi, Durga Puja, Diwali will come together and this is the time when the poor get the opportunity to connect their economy.
And a natural joy is also mixed in these festivals.
And if we talk about the economy then hundreds of families start making arrangements through small housing industries several months before the festival of Rakhi.
Today people have started giving more interest to the households and the households.
Businesses of thousands and thousands of people are linked to this festival.
It is directly related to those poor families who have made small lamps of soil.
But today, while talking about the economy of the poor people associated with saints and saints, I want to take up the issue of environment.
And they have urged me to speak about the environment in terms of Ganeshotsav i. e.
First of all, I am grateful to these awakened people.
He urges me to decide this topic beforehand.
This year's public Ganesh festival has a special significance.
I am sure that you all will be connected with this resolution.
And this will provide employment to the poor and the poorest of the artists and the poorest of the poor.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor and the economy of the poor, let us enjoy the economic benefits of the households of the poor and let them enjoy economic prosperity.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals.
We feel proud and proud of our daughters.
Just a few days ago, our daughters performed their sports in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
I felt very good talking to them, but I realized that there was a lot of misery in the minds of the world speaker.
Their faces seem to be strained and stressed.
I told them a different analysis.
I said, "Look, today there is a time for fame middlemen to increase their expectations.
It has been increased so much that when success is not achieved then the same aspirations are converted into zeal.
We have seen many such games in which if the sportsperson of India becomes oppressed then the anger of the country is expressed on those players.
Some people leave their limits and talk about things that are very painful.
But this was the first time that even if our daughters were not won by the world, 125 crore citizens of the country took the burden of those defeats on their shoulders.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the country.
I once again congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters.
Every citizen of the country should take a pledge and every citizen of the country should initiate this pledge in the next five years.
Let us come together and move ahead and do something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The weather is changing.
The sun was also very strong this year.
However, the monsoon rains have driven on time and their next movement is going on smoothly.
In many parts of the country there is a hazardous atmosphere due to heavy rainfall.
After the rains, the guarantees have received relief from the scorching heat of the past few days.
And all of us have seen how many challenges in life, however stress, personal life, public life, the arrival of monsoon changes our mindset.
The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm in many parts of the country today.
At present in some parts of the world the festival of the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated .
The poor of the country is connected with Lord Jagannathji.
The people who came to Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has been taught and he must have seen that he should commend the temples and their traditions because social justice and social harmony were inherent in them.
The holy month of Ramadan was celebrated with holy respect.
Now it is Eid.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitrah.
Ramzan is a month of donating puja.
It is a month of enjoyment and the more enjoyment you can enjoy it.
Let us gather together and take inspiration from these sacred festivals and take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, a very motivated incident of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of nearly three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village. In a way, the population of our Muslim families is more.
During this Ramzan, the villagers have decided to build toilets together.
The government also gets help from this individual toilet and under this assistance approximately Rs. 17 lakhs have been given to them.
You should spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the villages.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy day into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
One of them is also very inspiring.
And most importantly, he made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free
You know that Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared open defecation free in our country.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared open defecation free this week.
I am particularly grateful to the administration of these five states, government and people for completing this work.
Then there was a movement of the body and mind.
This is the theme of cleanliness.
These evil habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everyone will have to take care of it.
A good motivational event will be remembered again and again.
And I am glad that now cleanliness is not a government programme.
It has become a movement for the common man.
And when the people sitting in the government take this step forward with the participation of the people then its strength increases manifold.
Recently, an excellent incident has come to my notice that I want to tell you.
This is the incident in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration has taken up a major task in public participation.
100 hours of tireless campaign.
And what is the goal
Construction of toilets in 10,000 houses in 71 rural households in 100 hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours has been successfully completed.
71 villages became Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate the people of the government, government officials and the citizens of that village in Vijayanagaram district.
Awareness towards the democracy of Prakash Tripathy is curiosity.
And democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
Awareness of consciousness is the price of liberation.
Regular awareness of democracy is essential and hence we used to remember the neglects of democracy and move forward towards the good things of democracy.
June 1975-25 was such a period that no democratic lover could forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into tricks.
The opponent was pressed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were present at the earliest.
Even the judiciary has not been able to escape the horrific shadow of the crisis.
The newspapers were made completely unemployed.
Today's journalists, students from all over the world, people working in democracy are constantly trying to increase the awareness of democracy by remembering that black period.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in a hurry.
Atal ji had written a poem when he completed one year and he had described it as his poetry.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is proud of the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world was Yoga.
People from the sea to the mountains used to welcome the sun rays in the morning and evening through yoga.
There would be such an Indian who would not be proud of it.
It is not that earlier Yoga was not there but today when Yoga was built in the threshold, Yoga has become the reason for the connectivity of the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga.
The Great Wall of China, where people practiced Yoga, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 meters from the sea level, Machu-Pichu, the world heritage site in Peru.
People performed Yoga in the shadow of the IFFL tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India gave a different dimension to India's friendship by practicing Yoga on Afghan friend Dam, Salma Dam.
Yoga classes were organized with Yoga Masters at the headquarters of the United Nations.
In Gujarat, around 55 thousand people from Ahmedabad recorded a new world record by doing Yoga at the same time.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time, I am fortunate to do yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also practiced yoga in Siachen where there were 20, 25, 40 temperatures.
Be it our Armed Forces, Border Security Forces, ITBPs, CRPFs, everyone has made Yogasanas their heritage with their work.
I had said this Yoga Day that three generations, because this is the third International Day of Yoga, so I had said that when the three generations of the family were together, I would send their photographs to me.
Some television channels also took up this issue.
I have received several photographs and some of the selected photographs have been collected on the Narendra ModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit a very interesting programme.
In Kerala for a few years P.
N.
A good programme is organised during Panikar Pilgrimage, and it is celebrated on the eve of reading and reading months to make people aware about book reading and reading public books.
I also remember the things that I had taken care of.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we should not give a floral floral floral floral floral floral floralism, we should give a book or welcome it.
That too is the handicraft of Khadi so that Khadi can be promoted.
When I was in Gujarat, we all had a habit, but after coming here my habit was lost.
But she went to Kerala and once again she became aware of the habit.
And now I have started informing the following people in the government.
We can also gradually become a nature.
The lives of Pushpaguches were very low.
Once upon a time, I'll keep it up.
But if the book is given then in a way it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a part of the family.
When I am talking about this then how historical value was there in such things .
When I went to England last year, Elizabeth, the queen of Britain, had invited me to eat.
But Rani Elizabeth has taken over the role of Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I went, I was very happy.
And when I was looking at it, it was their request that I should touch it.
A small visit to Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am sure that these habits do not change in the night, and whenever they say this, they have to be rich in vaccine.
However, we should try to tell such things.
Now I cannot say where I went and whoever gave me Pushpaguchcha, I would not let him go.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister has done a lot of things in this regard.
However, I have developed a habit for me that I read some of the letters from me everyday and that is why I get the opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters come up and write fast-paced Manse letters.
I want to tell you about it recently.
Arulmozhi Saranan, a homemaker from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, far away, sent me a letter.
And when the letter was made, he wrote that he thought of taking some economic initiatives keeping in mind the education of children in his family so that the family could get some financial help.
I took money from the banks under the Mudra Yojana and started work towards supplying some goods from the market.
Some people were asked, I have registered it on my own, I would like to tell the countrymen that you should also get such an opportunity.
It is a new kind of system to visit the GeM.
Those who want to provide goods to the government, they want to sell trees and vegetables, if they want to send tables then they can register their names on them.
All the departments of the government are watching the people who register under EEGM.
Without agents, many things get cheaper.
The Arulmozhi Madamani Government has registered all the items that they can supply to these indicators.
The letters he has written to me are very interesting.
He has written that once he got money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started, I wrote about what I can provide on e-GeM and I received orders from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what the Prime Minister's Office would have demanded.
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arulmozhi didn't write to me letters, I wouldn't have noticed that a housing hole is working in the e-GeM system, it can be purchased from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Bazarpet-GeM
I wish that those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way, they should add more and more to it.
I believe that this is an excellent example of the government and the Kamal administration. And what is the goal of achieving affordability, efficiency and transparency
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can also be proud of our success in space sciences.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground for Yoga, then our dreams are to overcome the horizons in the sky.
A few days ago, India has done a lot in the field of sports and science.
Today, India is bridging its address not only on the ground but also in the space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 small satellites including cartosat-2 malaria satellites.
And in addition to India, there were 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
And this Small Scale Scale Scale Campaign of India will help in the field of agriculture and natural disasters.
You must have noticed that a few days ago, ISRO successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And this is one of the weightiest satellites that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it with the weight of elephants.
You can imagine how many things our scientists have done in the space sector.
On 19th June, the Mangal Mission completed 1 thousand days.
All of you would be aware that when we successfully got a place in the area for the Mangal Mission, this entire campaign was for 6 months.
It is sending photographs, giving information, scientific information, it has been working for more than a fixed life.
It is important for us to complete one thousand days for our scientific journey.
We are also seeing in the field of sports that the performance of our youth is rising.
Indias Badminton Film Kidambi Srikanth conquered the Indonesia Open Competition and enhanced the country's pride.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to him and his apprentices for this victory.
A few days ago, I had to run P.
T.
I got the opportunity to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Synthetic Track of Usha School of Athletics.
The more we encourage sports, the more we can sports.
Sports play an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in overall personality development is otherwise.
There is no dearth of talented players in the country.
If the children of our family have juice in sports then they should be given the opportunity.
They should not be taken out of the field and stopped in the room, they should not be practiced.
They should also study and show shining performances in them but if they are fond of sports, then schools, colleges, families and people around them should be encouraged and encouraged.
Everyone wants to dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget this year's summer.
Just wait for the rain.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramadan has started.
I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and around the world, especially the Muslim community on the auspicious occasion of the holy month of Ramzan.
In Ramzan prayers, spirituality and religion are given great importance .
We are extremely fortunate to India that our ancestors have created such traditions and today India can proudly proudly proudly proud the 125 crore countrymen that all communities of the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and those who deny God.
There are people who worship the idol and people who oppose the statue are also there.
Every kind of thinking, every kind of pooja, every kind of tradition is here and we have inspired the art of living with each other.
Whether it is religion or community or tradition or tradition, all these things give us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This sacred month of Ramzan will certainly be helpful in taking forward this path of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again convey my best wishes to everyone.
I am very happy to say that many people have responded to it.
Individually, everyone showed me the enthusiasm to tell me about our minds.
I have not been reading everything, I have not heard the message of everyone, so many things have come up.
But if we look at these messages then some people have tried to learn music according to what we saw, some people are trying to put their hands on new words, some people are trying to learn new things by using YouTube and are learning new languages.
Some people are learning art, some are learning dance, some are taking dramatic tests.
Some people have written that we have started writing poetry now.
Some people are trying their best to understand Nalanda and live with nature.
I am very happy that I would like to tell you a phone call.
"My Daksha Katyal speaks.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I felt that how much struggle we had to fight for India's independence, how many sacrifices we had to sacrifice, how many freedom fighters have hurriedly laid down their lives.
I was very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I request you to give some message to the new generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is interested in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.
My dear brothers and sisters, the great souls spent their lives in the hurricane for the freedom struggle and climbed on the throne of several young fans.
And that is why we can breathe in a free India today.
You must have seen one thing that the great men who fought in the freedom movement during the time of independence had done a great job of writing, studying and their scriptures also strengthened India's independence.
I had gone to Andaman Nicobar a few years ago.
He had also visited the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote the book "Majhi Janmathep" in Turung.
He used to write poetry and write on the walls.
They were closed in small places.
How the freedom fighters must have suffered
When I read this book of Savarkar's birthplace, it inspired me to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a sound drive programme which is very inspiring.
There should not be a single state in India, there should not be a single linguistic group of Indians who would not have spent their strings in that cellular tunnel at the earliest of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
This is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
It is our duty to take care of the world that we have not seen.
If you are very tired then open the doors, open the doors, breathe in the fresh air, you get a new chaitya.
Whenever there is contact with those five great personalities who have formed their bodies then there is a new chaitanya place in our body and a new energy is visible.
This is experienced by all of us, but we never see it, we dont bind it in a single thread, we do not bind it in a single thread.
You must have seen that whenever we get connected with our natural conditions, there will be a new chaitanya inside us.
And that is why the global mission of connecting with the Nature of 5th June should be our self-reliance.
We are getting some benefit from our ancestors protecting the environment.
Now if we protect the environment then the generations coming here will benefit from it.
And if we see an economy then it is the biggest guideline of the environment and it should be written thousands of years ago.
"Mata Bhumi: Son Aham Prithvi:"
It is said in the Vedas that the purity that we have in us is due to the Earth.
Dharmati is our mother and we are her son.
If we recall Lord Buddha, one thing is certainly visible that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana had taken place under the tree.
But it needs to be done in modern terms and with modern techniques.
We have linked the world with Yoga.
The way Yoga connects the body, mind, mind and soul, that is why today it is bringing together.
Todays lifestyle is becoming increasingly difficult due to rising hazards due to running and running.
Even from a young age this stressful mind is coming to the fore.
Yoga has an important role in leading a stress-free life in such a way that the medicines should be taken and the days should be covered.
Yoga is a means of ensuring health and well-being.
Yoga is not just exercise .
It is possible through yoga if we want to experience the interaction with the health of the body and mind and thought.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to all the governments and leaders of the world.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to Yoga, some Bakshis have been announced.
The work will progress in that direction smoothly.
I have received an information and I congratulate those who have made this valuable imagination.
There is a very psychological information.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day of Yaad and you should urge the three generations of the family to do Yoga this day.
Aji-Azoba, i-Baba, son-in-law-three generations should do yogasana together and upload their photographs .
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, there will be such a beautiful difference that will give Yoga a new dimension.
I am grateful to you all for this imagination. And I also feel that the way we had launched a mission of selfie with a very interesting experience, similarly, the photographs of three generations of Yoga will be awakened in the country and around the world.
You must send a collective photograph of those three generations of people on Narendra Modi App and MyGov where three generations are doing Yoga.
Yesterday, there will be photographs of tomorrow, which will ensure the future of the golden future.
I invite you.
International Yoga Day is still expected to be held for three weeks.
In a way, this is the movement for healthcare.
I invite you all to participate in it.
When you people gave me the responsibility of our Chief Servant, when I got the opportunity to speak first from the Red Fort on the 15th of August of my tenure, I had talked about cleanliness.
Since then, my journey has been going on from different parts of India. And I have noticed that what Modi is doing, what Modi is doing, what Modi is doing, what Modi has done.
The reason for this has come to me in a very cautious telephone and I must have thought in the same way as he said.
But I am grateful to them for this thing.
You can also hear this telephone.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am talking to Nana from Mumbai.
I always look at Modi Ji on television and social media that wherever you go, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, according to your request, people should collectively take cleanliness as a mission.
There is also awareness about cleanliness in children.
Small kids see the elderly many times while barring the roads from dirt.
The cleanliness mission that you have started from the valleys of Kashi has taken the form of a movement by your inspiration.
Your belief is that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleanliness but recently it is seen celebrating the festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days prior to my arrival, seven days prior to my arrival, a massive cleanliness programme was launched ten days ago.
Just a few days ago, I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a very big cleanliness campaign.
But I didn't know about these two things.
But after this telephone call, I have thought that this thing is true.
You can imagine how much pleasure I might have been able to understand this thing.
What else would be the matter of happiness for me that the relationship of cleanliness is linked to my visits
There is a habit of preparing for the reception of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness has become a key factor in it.
This is also a matter of happiness and inspiration for those who love cleanliness.
It is very good to imagine, but I have to think about it.
However, it is true that this movement should continue to stand up and instead of meeting some goods and memories, it is a good thing to give a gift to the Amuk tons of garbage coming out of the cleanliness mission.
It will be a greater humanity.
Once we started assuming the wealth of this waste that many new methods of waste management will come in front of us.
Youngsters associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and new instruments.
The Government of India has decided to open a massive campaign of waste management with the help of the governments of the states and the representatives of the cities.
On 5th June, the World Environment Day will provide appropriate means of collecting dense waste and liquid waste in about four thousand cities.
Two types of garbage will be made available, one of them will be green and the other will be blue.
Two types of waste are manufactured - one wet waste and the other dry waste.
These wastes will be kept in four thousand cities and we will put dry waste in blue waste and wet waste in green waste.
The waste that comes out of the kitchen should be vegetable salads, boiled food, egg shields, potatoes, potatoes.
Other types of waste materials such as rubber papers, lips, iron, glass, cotton, plastic, polythene, rubber, rubber, carbohydrate etc. are dry waste.
I am sure that we should develop such a culture and we should take a new step in the direction of cleanliness when we can fulfil the dream of cleanliness that Gandhiji had seen.
Today, I want to mention one thing with pride that even if one person decides on his mind, he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is one such thing.
Citizens have been suffering for nearly 80-90 weeks and have made Versova sea shore clean and beautiful when thousands of tons of waste have been wasted.
Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV) had taken up the responsibility of this task.
Brothers and sisters, today, I am happy to share one more thing with you that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Riyasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become Hagunadari free.
I congratulate all the citizens of Reasi Block, the administrators there and Jammu and Kashmir for putting an excellent example.
And I have also been told that the leadership of this entire movement was women living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out a torch pearl for spiritual awareness and inspired people from their homes and streets.
I congratulate those mothers and sisters, I congratulate the administrators there who have started making a Block Hagunadari free on the soil of Jammu Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, a record record of three years of work done by the present government on TV channels, social media and the present government has been taken from the newspapers for the past few months.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
During these three years of work, every cassette has been recorded.
People from all sections of the society have analyzed it.
I consider all these things important. Somewhere in it, somebody has given some support, some error has been recorded.
I also thank those people who have made critical and important responses.
If there is light on errors and deficiencies then there is a chance to improve them.
For a conscious nation, this movement is very important for a Chaitanya nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common man like you and the impact of a good White will be on me as much as it will be on the minds of a common man.
It seems as if I am talking about the things of the house while sitting in the family.
And there are hundreds of families who have written this thing to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, when we meet again, every nook and corner of the country, the weather has changed, the financing of exams, the start of a new student life will begin and a new joy and fresh fragrance will come along with the arrival of rains.
Let us all move ahead in such an environment with love for nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like a seeker, there is also an eye on the numerous contributions made to the people who have fallen into the society, on the other hand, often the government is not being looked into.
The information that comes every time for Mann Ki Baat was a comprehensive analysis of the government.
What are the types of information, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
Ordinarily it has been found that human nature is to advise others.
Immediately, if someone is coughing on the bus, if someone is coughing on the bus, then immediately ask him to do this.
Advice, information, feeling that something is in our nature.
Most of the people who give information are those people who try to reach me, who really do something in their lives.
And when we realise these things, I realise that these are not common information, these are the words of experience.
Some people also do the information because they feel that if these ideas are being done there, wherever they are working, if the other people hear that and if they get a comprehensive look then many people can benefit.
And that is why they have a natural desire to mention this in Mann Ki Baat and all these things are very positive in my view.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to most of the people who have worked for the welfare of the society.
Not only this, whenever I mention something, I feel very happy to see such things.
Last time some people in Mann Ki Baat had informed me about food and I had expressed concern about it.
And after that, many people from every corner of the country used innovative ideas on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov.
I have never thought that today, especially the younger generation of our country has been doing this thing for several years.
We have heard that some social organizations are doing this for a few years but the youth of my country are involved in this work.
Many have sent me a video.
There are several places where there is a bank of poultry.
In the banks of these pools, people deposit their potatoes, deposit vegetables and take away the necessities from them.
Even those who give solutions do not seem to be inadequate.
This is an example of how the society works with the help of society.
Today is the completion of the month of April, the last day.
The States of Gujarat and Maharashtra are being established on 1st May.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the States have consistently endeavoured to scale new heights of development.
We have contributed to the progress of the country and inspire us to remember these great personalities in every sphere of our society and in every sphere of our society.
We have to plan for that resolution and move forward with the participation of all the citizens.
Nature has changed all the rules of sports.
The sunshine in our country in May-June has enabled us to experience it in March-April.
And when I was informing people about Mann Ki Baat, people have informed me about what to do in the days of summer.
s.
Many such friends of Kartik have expressed concern about the birds.
He said that water should be kept on the verandah, on the glass and I have seen that small children from the family like this.
Once they came to know that they had to fill the water by dodging it ten times a day. Whether there is water in the utensils or not, whether the birds came or not.
We believe that this is a game for them, but indeed it is a wonderful experience to awaken this sensitivity in the minds of children.
You will also feel a new joy in seeing the animals and birds.
A few days ago, I had sent a book from Gujarat, Save the Sparrows, and he had expressed concern about the decreasing number of chimneys, but he himself did what he tried to protect them in the form of a campaign.
In our country, we have painted animals and nature with them in this color of co-existence. However, it is essential that such efforts should be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the religious leader of the Dawoodi Bohra Samaj, Syedna Saheb, had completed 100 years.
He spent 103 years.
And on his 100th anniversary, the Bohra community had launched a massive campaign to save the image of Burhaani.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate it.
He had distributed about 52 thousand bird feeders to every corner of the world.
He has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are suppliing ourselves, we are suppliing ourselves with milk, vegetables, postman, but we forget that the days of summer are the days of summer, if they want water.
Friends, I have to make some mistakes with you too.
Sometimes I am concerned that many of our younger generations are happy to lead a comfortable life.
Mothers and sisters are also combining them in a defensive situation.
There are some other points, but most comfortable situations are observed.
Now the examinations are over and plans have been made to enjoy holidays.
It feels good even after sunrise and heat.
However, I have to say something about how you will be able to live with a friend.
I am sure some people will definitely use it and tell me.
If you use this holiday, I offer you three proposals, it is a very good thing, but try to do something out of three.
New place, new experience, new skills.
Sometimes seeing something on television or reading in books or listening from familiarities and experiencing that thing on its own , there is a difference between land and property .
Experiments should be positive and comfortable.
We are from middle class families and are from a happy family.
I don't want to say again, do it once again.
The time of the evening, take your football, take a volleyball or go to a poor village with any sports literature.
You will get to see that you have never had the joy of playing with those poor children.
Whenever you will get the opportunity to play with you, you have ever thought how big a change will be brought about in their lives.
And I believe that once again it will be a jewel.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several NGOs are working in service.
Sometimes there are very hot camps .
Personality is of development, there are many developments and can be a part of it.
But at the same time, you feel that you have done such a hot shield, you have done a practitioner of personality development, you should not take any change to those people of the society who have not got the opportunity to learn what you have learnt.
You can teach them how to do it.
I am also concerned about the fact that technology has come to reduce the gap, technology has come to abolish the limit.
Every technologies have surpassed the other.
Today is the era of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot of in life is a good thing and the idea of doing something is a good thing.
But we also see that the human element inside us is not thorny, we are not far away from human qualities.
Can the skill development be given a little bit
Attempts are made to spend time with yourself away from technology.
Whether it is Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Malayalam, Gujarati, Malayalam or Punjabi, whether it is Tamil or Tamil or any other language.
And if we look at the country with so many diversity then we can find a person who does not teach anybody around us.
If there is no swimming then learn swimming , extract pictures and not best pictures, but try to roll on paper.
The sensitivity inside you will have to be revealed.
Sometimes we talk about small things that we dont want to learn.
You see, all these new experiments, these skills will give you joy and you will not be able to get out of what you have built in a square of life.
Do something of Chakoribahar, my friends.
This is the opportunity to make life.
And you are wondering if all the exams are over, if you learn about the new aspects of the work then that opportunity will not come.
And that is why I tell you that if you have the verse of learning joke then learn the joke of letters.
Keep showing your friends and friends.
You must try to know something that you don't know.
Your inner strength will be conscious and there will be a great opportunity for development.
I tell you from my experience that we cannot imagine what we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new towns, new villages, new campuses.
He stayed there for three days and four days after his departure.
Then go to another place, stay there for three days and four days.
You will get to learn a lot from this.
Whenever you go, you must send me a photo.
What's new
Where do you go
You can share your experiences using the hash tag incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has given you a lot of opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from the behaviour of barriers.
You can also earn a lot of money through this scheme.
The Government of India has a plan.
If you download Bhima App, you are also using it.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you have done it by 20 people in a day, you can earn 200 rupees by evening.
You can also earn businessmen, students can also earn.
And this scheme is till 14th October.
You will have a contribution in making Digital India.
He was a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience was telling us that the red light was on the vehicle, it was on the car, but gradually this VIP culture was on the verge of rotating in the head and in the head.
Now only the Red Fort has been laid so that no one can claim that the red lamp in the head must have come out.
I have received an interesting telephone.
He has also expressed condolences in this telephone but this telephone shows that the common man does not like these things.
He feels a kind of inadequacy in it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I say Shiva Choubey from Madhya Pradesh.
I was very proud to hear that the evergreen India is a VIP on a road. And I was happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't want to interfere in the traffic congestion and I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to thank you for this decision.
It is a part of the system that goes to red divine through government decisions.
But we have to remove it from our minds.
If we all make a conscious effort then we will be able to get rid of it.
Our concept of New India is to increase the importance of EPIs in the country rather than VIP and when I say EPI in place of VIP, my feeling is clear - Everi Person is Important.
Every person has the importance, every person has the spirituality.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore countrymen, if we accept the importance of 125 crore countrymen then how much power will be united to fulfil the great dreams.
All of us have to do together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we should recall our history, our culture and our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are commemorating a thousandth birth anniversary of 1. 25 billion countrymen, Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
For some reason we were so stunned that we were thinking for more than a century.
For other countries around the world, centuries have a lot of importance.
But India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years old memories about it.
Just imagine something .
Even today, there is a lot of difficulty in saying that social customs are breaking.
How would it be a thousand years ago
He himself had done his service to the society who was untouched by his conduct.
Thousands of years ago, he had campaigned for the entry of his temple and successfully entered the temple.
How fortunate are you that in every age, great men have been born in our society to eliminate the evils of our society.
While celebrating a thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharyaji, we must take inspiration from him to awaken the spirit of social listening and organisation.
The Government of India will also publish a postage stamp on 1st May for the memory of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
I salute Saint Ramanujacharya ji and pay homage.
My dear countrymen, the 1st of May is one more important.
It is also celebrated as a Workers Day in many parts of the world.
And it is natural for me to recall Babasaheb Ambedkar when the issue of Labour Day was discussed, labour was discussed and workers were discussed.
And very few people would be aware that today we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the salutation that has been received by the workers.
The contribution made by Babasaheb for the welfare of workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, I talk about Saint Ramanujacharya ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka, Guru Basweshwar ji.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
He had a programme to dedicate his pledge to the nation.
In the Kannada language, he had said - 'Kay Kailas' means that you can obtain the carvings of Lord Shankar's house by your hospitality, that is, heaven is achieved only by doing karma.
In other words, this is Shiva.
I once again talk about 'Shreshtha Jayate'.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattapanth Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world .
Buddha's thoughts are very relevant when the world is facing the problems of violence, war, destruction and armed forces.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of his journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that on this great occasion of Buddha Purnima, Vesak Day is celebrated on the occasion of United Nations.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this holy occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
They will get the opportunity to brighten their memory.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And when we say 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
On 5th May, Rosie India will launch South-ASEAN satellite.
The capacity and facilities associated with this satellite will be very helpful in fulfilling South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
In most parts of the country, a lot of families will be covered under the supervision of their children.
There will be a slightly stress-free environment where the tests have been conducted and those whose examinations are still going on, there will be some tension in those houses.
However, I would like to tell you this thing that at the last moment, I had heard from Mann Ki Baat what I had told the students.
We will certainly be able to use those things during the examination.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Wang-Brothers.
Today, on this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh should progress and develop and I assure the Bangladeshis that India is a supportive partner of Bangladesh.
We are a good friend and we will continue to participate in peace, security and development in the entire department by sharing our shoulders.
We all are proud of the fact that this is our shared heritage of Rabindranath Tagore and his memory.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, while the British had also given him the title "Nighthood".
When in 1919, when the British in the Jallianwala Bagh massacred a large number of civilians, Rabindranath Tagore was one of those great men who had raised their voices against this incident.
This was the period when a child of 12 years had a unique impact on this incident.
During the adolescents, those who laugh at the fields, those who laugh at the excavations, those children who laughed at the excavations were given a new inspiration for life by the brutal genocide of the garden.
In 1919, this 12-year-old boy is a brother-in-law, the son of all of us, the inspiration of all of us is martyr Bhattasing.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, Bhatta Singh ji, his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were taken over by the British and we all know about that incident on 23rd March.
Bhattasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were at that time satisfied with the service of Mother India and there was no fear of death.
He had sacrificed his life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes are still inspiring for us.
The words of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be incomplete.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit that place and I felt that there are special feelings in that land. And I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to visit Punjab, we must visit the shrine of Bhagsingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagsingh and Matoshree and Patukeshwar Dutt.
This was the time when the spirit of freedom, its intensity and its spread continued to grow.
On one hand, heroes like Bhattasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for a strong revolution.
So, just a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha on 10 April 1917.
This is the century of Champaran Satyagraha.
The emergence of Gandhian thought and Gandhian style in the Indian freedom struggle was seen during the Champaran Satyagraha.
This was an important step in the entire journey of freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of struggle.
This was the time, the end of the workers of Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Ahmedabad and the deepest impact of the thoughts and work style of Mahatma Gandhi Ji.
In 1915, Gandhiji came back from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot assess the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the statue of Gandhiji in our mind.
Imagine that a person returns to India in 1915 and works only for two years.
The country didn't recognize them, they didn't have any effect, it just started.
We can imagine how hard they had to face and how hard they had to face.
Champaran Satyagraha was an event in which Mahatma Gandhi's organisation skills, the power to recognize the foundation of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the power of Mahatma Gandhi Ji to fight against the British monarchy, organising, motivating and fighting for the poor and the underprivileged, all these unparalleled powers. And that is why we experience the separation of Mahatma Gandhiji.
This was the time when Gandhiji, Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani had sent everyone to the treasury.
And the British didn't know what was the way Gandhiji's work was done.
On one side there was conflict and another construction.
On the one hand, the carriage officer and on the other hand should be automatically involved in constructive work.
Efforts to transform and transform the 125 crore countrymen are going to lay the foundation of a New India.
New India is not a government programme or a political party.
New India is an appeal to 125 crore countrymen.
There are many people who go to the hospitals and serve the patients. There are many people who run for blood donation at the required cost.
Many people worry about the stomach of those who have forgotten.
Our country is multi-purpose.
Peoples service means service to the Lord is divided into our nerves.
If we look at it in a collective way and look at it in a combined form then this is a great power.
If every citizen resolved that I should follow the rules of transportation, if every citizen decides that he will perform my responsibilities honestly, if every citizen decides that I will not use petrol-diesel for one day in a week, then how small is it
You will see that the dream of a New India and 125 crore Indians will be fulfilled before your eyes.
It means that every citizen should follow his citizen's religion and follow his duties.
My dear countrymen, I want to thank you today.
In the last few days, an environment has been created in our country that people have participated in digital payments and digital movements.
After demonetization, there was an increase in the different types of digital payments.
BHIMP has started for just two-and-a-half months, but till now about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, the fight against black money and corruption has led us to justice.
25 billion Indians will make a pledge to dedicate 2. 5 thousand crore digital phones in one year
We have announced in the budget.
It is not necessary for the 125 crore countrymen to wait for a year.
This work can be done in six months.
2500 crore digital transactions, if we are going to pay the fees in school, dont fill the roads, digitally, we will make digital payments in the air travel.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several Digital Fairs have been organized for public education and public awareness.
It is a pledge to make 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
There was also a Bakshis scheme in it.
Nearly 1. 5 lakh people have been benefitted under the lucky scheme.
70 thousand traders have earned their income.
On completion of 100 days, a big event will be held in the end.
There is a big settlement in it.
I am confident that we will propagate Bhima in the number of days that are still in our hands for Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti.
We will be involved in reducing the risk risks and reducing the use of nutrition.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to say that every time I ask for information from the people for Mann Ki Baat, there are several different kinds of information but I have seen that there is information about cleanliness every time.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, my Namaskar, first of all I congratulate you for your victory in these elections.
I want to tell you about my mind.
I want to say that people should themselves understand the need for cleanliness.
I go to that river everyday where most people pollute the river by putting garbage in large quantities.
This river flows from the bridge of 'Rispna' and reaches my house.
I would like to say that we should inspire this thing through a group or a new paper.
"Look, brothers and sisters, how much trouble has been faced by the girls who have learnt in Akrav.
There is so much anger on seeing the garbage in the river .
I consider this as a good symptom.
I want this thing that 125 crore countrymen have to create tricolor on dirt.
Ever since the launch of the Swachhta Abhiyan, awareness has come to people.
Everyone has been connected with it positively.
Now this campaign has taken the form of a movement.
Tricolor is on the rise in untouchability.
Awakening, increasing active participation has a different significance.
But cleanliness is more related to habits than movement.
This is a movement to change the habit of hygiene and this is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be in collective form.
The work is difficult, but we have to do it.
I believe that the spirit of awakening among the new generations, children, students and youth of the country is indicative of good results.
Today, I would like to tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri has been conveyed by Gayatri from Mann Ki Baat.
Have you ever thought that how much of the waste of food that we put in
Have you ever thought that if you don't waste food then how many poor people can have their stomach
This is not a subject that will have to be understood.
When our mother grows up, she says that the more she wants, the more she wants.
Some efforts are being made, but the distress about it is a social treachery.
This is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if the savings take place, the family will get financial benefits.
I don't want to talk much about this, but I believe that awareness should increase.
Some youngsters are aware of this kind of campaign.
He has prepared a mobile pill.
Where such food is eaten or boiled, they talk to other people and use that food .
The youth of our country are making such efforts.
We will find such people in every state of India.
Their lives also inspire us not to waste food but also to increase food as much as you want.
See, there are ways to change and those who are aware of health always say that the stomach should be kept empty.
I will tell the countrymen, there is no incurable disorder.
A psychological environment has to be created and treatment starts.
Its first mantra is to be revealed instead of pressing cruelty.
Tell your colleagues, friends, parents, feelings and teachers openly what happens to you.
Sometimes the problem of integrity is more for students living in hostels.
They don't come with food tables.
Have you ever noticed this thing
We know that this is the first step in the direction of integrity.
If he avoids staying with his family, if he goes into a single coach, it will not happen.
Those with whom he lives openly, he will be in the company of such people.
Inspire him to become a victim of laughter, open his tumor somewhere in his mind.
This is the best solution.
Abnormality can become the cause of mental and physical diseases .
The way diabetes invites all diseases, it reduces the ability of fighting, adventure and decision-making.
Friends, Your family, your environment can keep you away from being afflicted with adversity.
There is one more solution.
If we cannot be open to the people of our neighbourhood, do one thing, go to a place where the work is being done with the help of service.
If we try to understand their grief with the spirit of service then a new confidence will be created in our minds.
By connecting with others, serving someone and serving with the spirit of selflessness, stress of mind becomes simple.
As such Yoga is also a good way of keeping mind healthy .
Yoga is very useful for emancipation from stress, emancipation from dabwa, happiness and taste.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
You should also prepare from now on and celebrate the collective yoga festival in the number of lakhs.
If you want to inform you about Yoga Day, then you should send your message to me through my mobile plication.
You can create poems and poems in Yoga so that these subjects can be easily accessible to the people.
In the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is a matter of great welcome that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
The responsibility of the family is assisted by the financial responsibility of the household, which sometimes causes injustice to the neighbours.
The Government of India has taken an important decision on this.
Women employed will now be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery, during pregnancy, the first 12 weeks of maternity leave.
In this regard, two or three countries of the world are ahead of us.
India has taken an important decision for our sisters.
The basic objective of this should be to take care of the newborn who is the future citizen of India.
In the condition of pregnancy, if he gets mother's love, then this child will be the patriot of the country tomorrow.
This will also improve the health of mothers and hence the benefit of this important decision will be about 18 lakh women.
Let us get inspiration from the lives of all these great men, let us have the power to resolve for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukal is a model, a year of Pratipada, a new year, a new year.
It is time for the farmers to get ready after the breakfast and the farmers to face the fruits of his health .
New year is welcomed in different parts of our country in different ways.
New Year is welcomed by Gudhipadwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Santsar Puja in Awadh province, Jud-Shital in Mithila region of Bihar, Satwani in Magadh province.
India is a country that has been divided by countless diversity.
My best wishes to all of you on this New Year.
Many thanks.
The window is now over.
The weather has entered the lives of all of us.
Fruits of summer season start appearing in the fascinating splendor of unbearable humidity .
At the same time, the flowers of peacock in the fields give a new impression to the minds of the farmers.
The blooming flowers of the pancreas indicate Holi .
Amir Khusro has described this moment of change in nature very fun.
Amir Khusro wrote, "Fool Rahi Sarson becomes gross, Amba's feet, Tesu flowers, Koyal speak, Dar-Dar.
"When nature is happy, when the environment is happy, humans also enjoy the entire weather.
The festival of Chamba Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi fills the color of happiness in human life.
Falgun is the last month in the atmosphere filled with love, brotherhood and humanity and we are decorated for the welcome of the coming Chaitra month.
The monsoon season is a confluence of two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of people of the country for this thing that when I ask for information from you people before Mann Ki Baat then I get a lot of information.
Our gratitude to you for remembering this pride of India.
Whether it is poverty alleviation, prevention of diseases, connectivity with the world, knowledge, information, technology and science have underlined our importance.
15 February 2017 is a day of great pride in the life of India.
Our scientists have raised the head of India in front of the world and we all know that in the last few years ISRO has successfully completed several missions.
In the last few days, ISRO has established a world record in the space sector after successful launch of a flight under the Mangal Greater Mars Mission.
This success will not only be for ISRO but also for the entire country.
ISROs Coast Effective Efficient Space Programme has become a wonder for the world and the world has openly acknowledged the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites is Cartosat-2D. It is India's satellite and Mola will be used for photographs, information, mapping, infrastructure development, development information and urban development plans.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water is available across the country How can they be used
It is also a matter of happiness for us that our young scientists and women scientists have led this all-round campaign .
This huge participation of youngsters and women is a tribute to ISRO's success.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the people of the country.
For the common man, these scientists have maintained the use of space science for the service of the nation and are recording new records.
Whatever we congratulate our scientists and their pearls, it will be a little less.
India's scientists have done this.
The capacity of this area is such that even from a distance of 2000 kilometres to attack India, if there is any hurdle in attacking India, it will finish it in the space.
When we see some new technologies and some new scientific research then we are happy.
Those who do not get the same answer, they are not healthy.
And if we look at the journey of thousands of years of human excellence then we can say that this development journey is not complete anywhere.
New science, new technologies emerge from it and every technologies give rise to a new era in the form of every new science.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have told Mann Ki Baat that our young generation should be attracted to science.
The country needs many scientists.
Todays scientists can become the reason for a sustainable change in the lives of the future generations.
A few days ago, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organised a special event on 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Social useful research was invited.
Sometimes the problem underlines the importance of science to find answers.
In Mumbai in 2005, there was an overwhelming increase, Mahapura came, seas were also flooded and many difficulties were created.
Whenever there is any natural calamity, the most observed crisis is there on the poor.
Two people worked tirelessly and developed home residue in such a situation that will save the households, save the lives of the households, save water from coming home and save the diseases arising out of polluted water.
Mechanisms are also being implemented.
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, there has been an increase in the emphasis on DG-Dhan.
Especially the younger generation has a habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I believe that this is a good symptom.
In the last few days, our country has received a good reciprocity for the 'Fortunate Consumer Scheme' and the 'Digit-Fund Business Scheme'.
About two months have passed, 15 thousand people are getting one thousand rupees per day.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making digital payments in India a public movement has been welcomed across the country.
It is a matter of joy that today 10 lakh people have been benefitted under the DG-Dhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand traders have been given remuneration and more than Rs.
There are more than 100 consumers in this scheme, who have received one lakh rupees as a refinance.
There are 4 thousand traders who have got 50-55 thousand rupees.
Shriman Santosh from Mysore expressed his happiness that he received a thousand rupees in the lucky Consumer Scheme.
But I believe that he has written an important thing to you.
He has written that when he got a thousand rupees, he realized that a poor woman's house had a fire and all the goods were burnt in that fire.
Santosh ji, our valour and our work are satisfying all of us.
We have done a very big motivation.
Brothers and sisters, in the last twenty-five years of Delhi, Bhai Sabir has now been associated with digital transactions and he has got a lakh rupees in the government's lucky customer scheme.
A young student from Maharashtra is practicing practitioners and practicing practitioners, how RuPay cards and e-wallets are used in their families and how much joy they get.
One lakh rupees are important for him, but he has taken up this task as a worker and connects others with it.
This movement has played a very important role in fighting against justice, corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work, from my viewpoint, the country's most corruption cadre, the opponent of corruption is the path.
In a way, you are the soldiers of Shukti.
On 14th April, a huge settlement of crores of rupees will be released.
There are approximately 40-fifteen days sculptures.
Remembering him, we should teach 125 people to download Bhima App.
Let us learn how Devan-Ghawan becomes.
Teach them, especially those who are small and medium traders around us.
Babasaheb Ambedkars Jayanti and Bhima App gave special importance to this occasion.
And that is why I want to tell you that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
By going home, by connecting everyone, we have to send Bhim App to 125 crore hands.
The movement that has started since last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in many urban settlements, several categories and several cities.
My dear countrymen, the farming sector has a huge contribution towards the root cause of the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
Today, I want to tell you about a great pleasure.
Our farmers brothers and sisters have filled the cereals with hard earnings.
This year's record production is due to the sufferings of the farmers of our country.
All the records are telling us that our farmers have brought all the records in the past.
This year, there has been such crops in the fields that everyday it seems that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand and seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
It is more than eight coins of the previous record in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented success.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
Thanks to the fact that with the traditional wages, the poor people of the country should think of producing pulses because the poorest of the poor get the maximum pulses.
I am happy that the farmers of my country have heard the voice of the poor and they have logged different pulses on about two hundred thousand hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but it is a great service to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters are eligible for special blessings for the way my farmers have harvested and produced pulses.
My dear countrymen, some initiatives are being taken by the government, by the society, by organisations, by everyone in terms of cleanliness.
In a way, everybody is aware of cleanliness.
The government is also making constant efforts.
A few days ago, under the leadership of our Secretaries, a programme of 23 senior officials of the State Governments was organized by our Government of India for drinking water and sanitation.
What is the significance of the work of sustainable sanitation, not symposium in the closed rooms of the state of Telangana
Toilet Pitt Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February using it .
The toilets of six houses were cleaned by evacuating the pits and most of them showed themselves that the pits used by the Twin Pit toilet can be used again by evacuating them.
He also showed how comfortable toilets used by these new technologies are and there is no difficulty in cleaning them and there is no mental obstacle.
We can clean the toilets as well as clean the toilets.
And if we look at the garbage collection in the toilets then it is black in a way.
We can see how we get wealth from waste, and this has been proved.
A standard twin pit toilet for the family of six people is filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and left in the other pothole.
There was a dissolution of waste collected in six to twelve months.
Nutrition, phosphorus and potassium are full of nutritious elements and it is considered to be a very good source of farming.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken such initiatives.
Now a special programme has been started on Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as possible.
Different departments of the government organise Swachhta Pandharwada regularly.
In the second quarter of March, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, these two other departments will undertake Swachhta Abhiyan.
We are aware that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, then the entire country feels a new energy, self-confidence increases.
We welcomed the achievements of our disabled sportspersons in the Rio Para Olympics.
The country is proud of the success of these disabled colleagues.
I always believe that the differently abled brothers and sisters are capable, they are determined, they are determined, they are determined.
Every moment we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind them.
They have moved ahead with their steps and their success has brightened the name of the country. Just a few days ago, our women association won the silver medal in the Asian Rabi Savings Trophy.
I convey my best wishes to all these players.
Womens Day is celebrated in the world on 8th March.
In India too, there is a need to increase awareness among the families and the society and increase sensitivity.
This campaign is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today, this is not just a government programme.
Today it has become a movement of social sensitivity and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been linked to this initiative.
Every corner of the country has played a crucial role in discussing this vital issue.
There has been a change in the minds of the people about the old customs that have been going on in the rainy season.
It is a pleasure to see the festival celebrated after the birth of a daughter.
In a way, positive thought about daughters is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kudalur district has brought a ban on childbirth under a special campaign.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, a lot of efforts are being made by the district administration to ensure that the orphan girls get their education along with planning the Gram Sabha.
In this programme of 'Har Ghar Dak' in Madhya Pradesh, education campaign for every household girl in villages is underway.
Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya campaign in Rajasthan is underway to motivate the girls who have left schools to re-school and motivate them for education.
New ideas are being linked to him.
They have changed according to local needs.
When we celebrate the Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling: Woman, Woman, Shakti, who is the woman of India, who is not in jealousy, who is the right to work, who is right in Sab My dear countrymen, you all get the opportunity to communicate something from Mann Ki Baat.
We too would have been actively involved.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to you.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every nook and corner of the country.
Recalling India's jurisdiction, the duties of the people, the rights of the citizens and its commitment to democracy, this festival, in a way, is a celebration of the responsibility of spreading democracy over the generations to come.
However, the widespread discussion of the rights and duties of the citizens in our country does not happen anymore.
I hope that at every level, the more important rights are given, the more important tasks should be given to them.
This morning, at 11 o'clock, we pay homage to martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country.
On the 30th of January, at 11 a.m., we must become a society, as a nation.
I congratulate the brave soldiers who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
These awards consist of several categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishva Seva Medal, Special Service Medal.
I am particularly grateful to the youth of the country and you are very active on social media.
Can you do one thing or can you find out the details of the heroes who have received this honor at this time and write two good words about them and reach out to their friends
When we talk about the courage, valour and courage of these brave soldiers, we are surprised, proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were happy to read the message of 26th January when we were enthusiastically celebrated. At the same time, the soldiers of the country had to lose their lives due to the heat wave.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers and bow down to them.
My young friends, you are aware of the tricks that I keep telling you about my Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March and April is a period of great casualties in every family.
About one or two children are tested in every household, but the entire family used to be covered under the scanner of that examination.
This time is very good for interacting with my student friends, their parents and teachers because wherever I go for several years, the exams of those who visit them seem to be very careful.
The family is contemplated, the students are careful, the teachers are in a dilemma.
When I was talking about this thing then many teachers, parents and students sent me messages, asked me questions, sent some information, problems and difficulties.
I would like to share with you all the thoughts that have come to my mind by reading them.
I got a telephone message of creation.
Sir, let me tell you that in the days of examination, there was a very dangerous atmosphere in our house, neighborhood and society.
Therefore, if the minds of the students get steadfast then we dont get upset.
I want to ask you so much that this environment cannot be pleasant.
The Prime Minister said, "It is true to the creation, but it will be embarrassing in our hearts.
There are very few people who see such a place in the examination.
For most of the people there was a pressure.
It is a prescribed prescribed that you have to make a decision of pleasure.
The pleasures, pleasures and enjoyments of this exam will get the same tricks and the time will come for the west of the processure.
Therefore, I believe that you should face the exams as if something should be done at a time.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family should play the role of fulfilling this festival with enthusiasm.
On seeing the picture will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there are three-four months of examination.
For these three-four months, according to your traditions, transform your family into festivals.
And that is why I will tell you, Smile More and Score More.
In a stressful situation, all the doors are closed, nothing can go inside and can not come out inside.
The process of thinking stops and these things are lost.
And you dont have knowledge, there is lack of information, there is a lack of concentration.
But if you are stressed then your knowledge and your information are diverted to it and stress is curtailed.
It is important to keep in mind that A chapy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes we feel that we do not look at the exams in the right direction.
It is our mentality to think that there is a question of life and death.
Whatever study you have done in the year, it will be a test for the same.
You dont have to face the criterion of your entire life.
It is not a test of all these things that you have lived in life, how you are living, what kind of life you have lived ahead.
Besides the examinations taken by the businessmen in the class, you have gone through several casualties.
The President of India, Dr.
J.
In today's era, the biggest challenge facing education is that of education.
Marks are getting a lot of importance.
Therefore, the competition has increased and the stress on the minds of the students has increased greatly.
I want to know your ideas about the present and the future of this education system.
He has answered in his question, but Rishya wants me to convey my views on this subject.
There is a limited use of qualities and qualities.
If you believe in these things then Mark will come back from us and you will never need to run behind them.
You will be able to utilize your knowledge in life, your talent will be useful, your self-confidence and determination will be used.
Would you like to see a mark sheet when you go to a lawyer to fight a big fight
This is a successful journey in the field of experience, knowledge and skills.
That's why Markan's misery sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
Richaji has also considered the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a very big mental battle.
I want to tell you that sports related examples are easy to understand.
Most of the successful sportspersons were very special that their competition was automatically.
We should take such examples by Sachin Tendulkar.
They have been travelling twenty years continuously, knowing about their own records and going ahead after losing themselves.
We should be very amazing because they followed the path of self-confidence rather than competing with others.
In every field of AYUSH, you have asked yourself about this question.
Whether we should get up early in the morning or not
Isn't it possible to get sleep due to exam stress earlier
He further said, "My mother has not learnt a lot.
Yet they settled near me and had to leave me mathematics.
I would just like to tell the parents that they should emphasize on three things, give them acceptance lines, teachings and time.
The parents will experience that their teachers have many problems with their children.
The burden on you will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask a single question about the details of that person.
In the past, he started listening to Vinodi.
Within four-five minutes, the atmosphere was flooded.
The RV patients are scared of the diseases that are going to meet them .
I want to tell the parents that sometimes we are very well aware of the love with the children.
Have we ever thought of giving the children a happy, laughter-smiling environment during the exam
You will see that the atmosphere will change.
I have received a phone call from another big stuff.
He said, "Namaskar Prime Minister, I cannot tell myself the name because my child has done my job.
I had once tried to copy my child.
And when I tried to make a direct copy, I was caught in it and I had a great deal of trouble with many of my close friends.
These shortcut roads become the reason for copying.
You must have heard this many times.
I will say the same again.
In any way the opposite of copying will be seen .
This is the creativity, if the time is spent on that examination then perhaps there is no need to make a copy.
I have received a phone call, he says, "My name is Monica, I am a 12th student so I want to ask you some questions related to board exams.
My first question is about increasing tensions during these tests, how can it be reduced
"If I talk about sports in the days of examination, then your teacher and your parents will come to me.
He said that the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister to show how to play children during the exam.
Because it has been noticed in sports that less attention has been given to us.
This idea is basically true.
The problem is the original.
Let us take a few moments out of your studies and look at the sky, look at the trees of Atibhovati, slightly shake your mind and then sit in your room for study.
Whether it is for five minutes or not, the rest should be given automatically.
You would have seen that the work was done even more.
Whether everyone likes it or not, but my experience tells me this thing.
There is no need to sit in the room for that.
Go to the glass, breathe for five minutes and then sit in the study.
Some people believe that if you wake up at night then you will get a lot of exercise.
But not.
Definitely take as much sleep as is necessary for the body .
Your efficiency will only increase.
When I go for the election campaigns, sometimes my voice is raised.
In such a situation, I had come to visit a folk singer.
He asked me, "How many hours do you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously.
If this is the case then you will keep your houses on me.
It is a very big medicine for keeping mind , intelligence and body alert .
Friends, You are engaged in the preparation of exams and I am busy with my thoughts.
Kunas Thauk, perhaps this speech of mine will help in removing the tension of your mind.
But at the same time, I would also say that do not take any action against what I have said.
If you are accumulating then do it or do not do it, otherwise it will be an ocean.
I am also sure that I have told your parents that I should not bear the burden of expectations on children.
Our determination is to confront the observers with self-confidence.
My best wishes are with you.
In order to cross every cassette, make that cassette a festival.
And then no test will be there.
You should move ahead with this mantra.
Dear Countrymen, on 1st February, 2017, the Indian Technical Team is completing its sixty years.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers and soldiers of the Takshak Dal for their service to the nation.
The Indian Technical Team, along with 126 aircraft and 62 aircraft, is regarded as the world's fourth largest Technical Team.
In order to secure the maritime boundaries and maritime regions of the country, the soldiers of the Takshak Dal are on the verge of Ahoratra.
Last year, the people of the Tarkashak Dal, along with their responsibilities, made the sea shore of our country clean.
Thousands of people participated in it.
They are truly grateful to them for taking care of the cleanliness of these shores along the seashores.
Very few people would be aware that in our country's technicians, not only men, but also women have been able to fulfil their responsibilities by putting their shoulders on their shoulders.
Our women officers of the Takshak Dal are arbitrarily, supervisors and are also responsible for the power of the powercraft.
Today, as the issue of security of coastal areas on the world level, I salute the Indian counterpart Dala on his 40th anniversary to keep Indias shores safe.
On 1st February, the 55th Panchmi will be celebrated.
It is considered the time of the prayer of the University.
Moreover, this is the period of inspiration for the heroes.
The song 'Mera Rang De Basanti Chola' shows the same inspiration.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
My dear countrymen, while spreading Mann Ki Baat, AIR also has a new colour in it.
Mann Ki Baat gives you a great opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, many congratulations to you all.
Todays day is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and doing.
Yes, it is our acceptance to the poor, not our neglect.
St. Luke has written in Ganspell that it has not only served the poor but also served the poor and it is indeed empowerment.
A story related to this is well-known.
It is said in that statement that Yesusu was standing near a temple treasure.
Many Shrimantas came and they donated a lot of money.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and he kept the name of two copper in it.
Now if we go to see what is the value of two copper twins
There was surprise in the minds of the devotees standing there .
He said that the widow has donated the highest donor to the widow, but the woman has donated everything to her.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Varanasi, which was the backbone of Malviya ji.
I laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and Maji Pradhan Mantri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never forget the contribution made by Atal ji.
Under his leadership, the country's values have also been raised in the field of nuclear energy.
Whether it is Party Leadership, Members of Parliament, Ministers or Prime Minister Atal ji has created an ideal in every geography.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray for his good health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are awakened to my eyes today.
When I tweeted this morning, I also shared an old picture of how Atal ji's affection as a small activity will definitely be seen in the picture.
Today, the citizens of the country will get the benefit of two schemes as a visit to Kolkata.
In a sense, two latest schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn and understand from each other.
In order to promote this process, the central government's incentive scheme for consumers and small businesses is being launched from today so that there is a habit of e-payment so that mobile banking is strengthened.
Bhagyavan Grahak Yojana is a scheme to promote customers while Digi Dhan Business Yojana is a scheme to promote traders.
This scheme will start from today and the next 100 days will continue.
Every day, 15,000 people will get Rs. 1,0000 per day.
At the same time, for such customers, one day will be released a week, in which lakhs of rupees will be paid and after three months, on April 14, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary will be a Mahasod, where crores of rupees will be deposited.
Digi Money Business Scheme is mainly for businessmen.
The traders should themselves participate in this scheme and also include customers to stop their behavior.
Independent seats will also be given to such traders and these numbers will also be in thousands.
The traders will continue to be self-employed and they will also get the opportunity to win the boxes.
This scheme has been formulated keeping all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class citizens at the centre.
Those who purchase more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of these bucks.
The poorest of the poor can also purchase goods using USSD through feature phones or simple phones, sell goods and also provide money and they can become beneficiaries of this scheme.
In rural areas, they can purchase and sell through AEPS.
30 crore citizens can join this Bakshis scheme immediately.
It is very simple that the ease of sending messages on Whatsapp is as easy as possible.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to see that the awareness about how to use technology in our country, how to do e-payments, how to make online payments.
In the last few days, uninterrupted behavior has increased by 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
The businessmen will be able to guess how big this decision is.
The income tax suit has been given to such traders who will facilitate online payments instead of barriers in their carriage through digital routes.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
A committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes on their behalf and started their implementation.
Someone told me that the Assam government has decided to provide 10 percent availability through digital payment of goods tax and trading permit fee.
The poorest of the poorest of the poor will get Rs. 50,000 through the government.
He also announced a saving of Rs. 5 lakhs under the Govt. of Indias Digital Business to 100 digital behavioural villages by 31st March 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced a discount of Rs. 5,000 to the first ten farmers who are fully digitally filled with seeds and fertilizers under Digital Farmer Shiromani Yojana for farmers.
I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate all the governments for taking such initiatives.
Several organisations have made several successful experiments to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers of the villages.
Someone told me that in a short span of days, about 35,000 farmers have purchased and purchased 5 lakh grams of cereals by filling them with a digital route.
It is a matter of pride that in comparison to last year, the company's sales have increased by 27 per cent.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, the scope of the informal sector has increased in our lifestyle. And most of these people are given the money of money, money of work or rental money, Rock Payments and therefore the absorption of labour continues.
Wherever you get 100 rupees, you get 80 rupees.
At the same time, they are also authorizing the benefits of other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easy for us.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have also made great progress in the field of start-ups.
These are the golden days of digital movement.
Our youngsters can empower this region with new vision, new technologies and new technologies.
At the same time, we should also participate in full swing in the mission to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month I appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat to share their thoughts with them.
This time, 80-90 percent of the claims received by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi are facing conflicts against corruption and black money.
When I saw all these things, I dedicated them to three parts of the country.
Some people have given me a detailed account of the difficulties faced by the citizens and the problems faced by the guerrillas.
The other types of people have written that despite all the good work for the welfare of the country, such a sacred work is going on in some areas and how new roads are being explored.
Third kind of people have requested that this fight continues with the support of what has happened.
Fraud and black money should be completely eradicated and the number of citizens who urge them to take necessary stringent steps is also significant.
I express my gratitude to all the countrymen for sending me a lot of letters.
Shri Gurumani Kewal said that this step taken to prevent black money transactions is compassionate, he added.
We are fighting against corruption and black money like military forces.
The words written on the notes are true, the rates of sweets have increased, the deduction of two thousand will also be canceled, the deduction of 500 and 100 rupees will be canceled.
However, the people of this country were stunned to hear these rumors.
Moreover, many people landed in the plains, they brought the true face of those who spread the fire through their skills and utilisation of their books, gave them the correct answer and brought them to the truth.
My greetings to the people on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 125 crore Indians stand with us, nothing is impossible.
Janta Jannadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for this great achievement of corruption and black money.
I felt that there should be widespread discussion in the House about the fight against corruption and black money.
If the work of the House had been done then it would have been a good discussion.
Some people are spreading all kinds of comfort to the political parties, they are completely wrong.
The law is similar to all.
Whether it is an individual or an organisation or a political party, everyone should follow the law and everyone has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in search of government errors.
There is a question of repeated changes in rules.
This government is for the people.
For 70 years, what power has been involved in this period of dishonesty and corruption
When I took the decision to fight such people, they started everyday efforts to defeat the government.
On the other hand, several citizens have also written letters about the ongoing non-professional practices and discussions on different aspects.
The public is giving more information than the information that comes from the government system.
The success that we get is due to the awareness of the common citizens.
In order to provide such information, the government has prepared an e-mail card and this information can be sent to it.
I express my gratitude to all those who write such letters, I believe in their letters and bless them.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of fatigue, there is no question of stopping. And there is no question of getting rid of the work that benefits 125 crore citizens.
You must be aware of the fact that in 1988 this law was enacted.
He was buried in basana.
We have brought it out and implemented the Anonymous Property Act.
This law will have to show its impact in the coming days.
Our top priority has been to do whatever is required for the country and for the welfare of the people.
India's rankings in the global banking industry have improved.
India has jumped 32 places in the global competitiveness of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and have jumped 19 positions in 2016 under the World Bank Countries.
The value addition of many calls is giving direction to India at a rapid pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the Parliamentarians have lost their lives.
A feeling of fury was expressed by the consolidation of the Parliament's work.
The President and the Vice President also spoke openly about it.
However, in such a situation, there are some good things and satisfy the mind.
A good job has been done in the Parliament. However, the country has not noticed it.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud and happy to say that the government has taken forward the campaign for the disabled.
I express my gratitude to all the members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this thing. I thank them for the crores of disabled persons of the country.
Our government is also committed towards Divyangjan.
I have personally tried to speed up this mission.
I wish that the disabled get their rights and get their due respect.
Our disabled brothers and sisters won four medals in the Paralympics and gave a new boost to our efforts and beliefs.
He raised the value of the country due to his victory and also embarrassed the people with his capability.
Our divyang brothers and sisters, there is an invaluable legacy and strength like every citizen of the country.
I am glad that after getting this legislative consent for the interest of the disabled, they will get more employment opportunities.
The reservation limit has also been increased to 4 in government jobs.
The Government has amended the new laws as per the views of the United Nations.
14 categories have been covered.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we will be proud of the fields of sports.

Thanks a lot
Like every year, I had gone to India-China Sieger to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I have celebrated Diwali in the higher Himalayan region along with the soldiers of ITBP, the soldiers of the army and all of them.
Every time, but the experience of this Diwali was different.
125 crore citizens of the country, who sacrificed their lives, sacrificed their lives to the soldiers of the Diwali army, had reflected their reflections on the faces of every soldier and were filled with emotions.
Some poems, some poems, some poems, some poems, some poets, some poets and others made videos.
I was surprised that every household had a few soldiers and when I read these letters.
These letters are full of emotions.
At the same time, there was an information on MyGov. Would you like to create a coffee table book by collecting the selected items
A soldier from our army has written to me, the Prime Minister, the holi of our soldiers, Diwali and every year is on the border.
It seems that we are celebrating Diwali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, the spirit that we have expressed in this Diwali about our armed forces will be limited to just a few occasions.
I would like to urge you to adopt this habit as a society, as a nation, as a nation, whether it is a festival or a festival, how we should remember the soldiers of our country.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of our army increases by 125 crore.
A few days ago, the Sarpanch of Jammu and Kashmir state had come to meet me.
He was a member of the Jammu-Kashmir Panchayat Council.
He had come from different parts of Kashmir and had 40-50 people.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a long time.
He had come up with issues related to the development of our village.
They had some demands and when our dialogue started, the issue of the losing Kashmir, the law and order situation, the future of the children came out.
In Kashmir, there was a need to talk about the problems faced by our countrymen. And I saw that they had the same problem as they were suffering.
He says that the future of children is not a school but a school.
I urged them to pay attention to the future of these children.
A few days back, there was a board examination and about 95 of the students and students of Kashmir had tested the board.
I congratulate him for his enthusiasm, but I convey my heartfelt congratulations to his parents, relatives, teachers and Sarpanch of all the villagers.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I asked you for information on Mann Ki Baat, I can tell you that everyone has sent information on the same topic.
He said that we should talk about 500 and 1000 notes.
I was also aware of the fact that in our everyday life we have to face many new problems.
We cannot afford to get rid of the disease that we have been facing for 70 years.
I can understand the difficulties faced by us.
Fifty-five thousand notes and such a big country, such a big challenge, such a bad news and this decision.
The entire world is watching Barkain, every economist is doing this incomplete analysis.
Over 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends and friends have been connected with the spirit of dedication.
Even though there are many types of tensions, all of them have been working very peacefully, considering this work as a sacrifice of service to the nation and as an attempt to bring about a great transformation.
They start in the morning, when will the night be completed
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Several such incidents come up everyday with television, newspaper and discussion.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all these colleagues who have worked hard in this great vision.
Identification of strength was done only when success came after the casualties.
I remember that when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank employees had taken the burden of it on their shoulders and they had done whatever work they had not done in 70 years.
Today, once again he has accepted that challenge and I am confident that the resolution of 125 crore countrymen, the collective strength of all, will give a new strength to this nation.
But evil habits have spread so much that even today many people do not have those bad habits.
Some people still feel that the money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, benami money and some others will be brought back to the system.
They are finding ways to save their money.
The sadness is that he has chosen the way to use the poor.
They are trying to save money by confusing the poor by paying money in their accounts by showing joy or temptation.
I would like to tell such people today, whether to reform or not to reform ourselves, if we dont want to follow the laws, what should we do
But don't play with the lives of the poor by honouring them.
And the government doesnt want our countrymen to face difficulties.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Tirali, J. Hadra, Madhya Pradesh.
It is very commendable that we have shut down the five hundred and thousand notes.
I want to bring several such examples from the heart of the people that they have welcomed this hard step for the advancement of the nation even after being neglected.
Because we say that good days will come but we will take such a big step.
The people of black money and corruption have got a good push after seeing the notes of five hundred thousand rupees.
There will never be a good day for every Indian.
I feel so happy that what is the unique potential of the common man of my country.
People go there and eat there and after 2-4-6 days when they go there again, they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country, in which there is a sense of service, self-respect and honesty.
At the time of election, I had played the role of 'Chai Pe Charcha' and this thing was published all over the world.
But I don't know that 'Chai Pe Charcha' is being linked.
In Gujarat, a girl from Surat gave only tea to the people who were married to her.
Once I was seen in the television boxes, when I came to light at night, I saw that there is a village named Dhekiyazuli in Assam.
What did he do when he got a note of Rs. 2000
Four women from the neighbourhood came together and they went to the market and bought together and made money using a note of Rs. 2000.
See how the lives of the farmers are also changing.
Immediately some people benefited from this campaign.
I got information about small towns.
It was reported from around 40-50 cities that due to the closure of this note, the people who were left behind were not paying money.
We are well aware that the poor people dont pay the money just two days ago.
Those people who are not familiar with them, who know that they will never think of them, they will not pay the money and they will remain very tired of it.
Each municipality gets 50 of the tax revenues.
However, this time the decision of the 8th stars left everyone to submit their old notes.
Last year, about three-seven thousand crore rupees were deposited in the 47 civil departments.
You will be surprised to know that in a week, 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited with them.
But today I congratulate the farmers of my country.
I have already figured out the crop production in this season.
Even after coming to the difficulty, the farmers have found the way.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Small traders of our country send employment and help in increasing the economy.
We have taken an important decision in the previous budget. Like a big mall, the small shopkeepers of the village can do their business for 24 hours.
Under the Mudra Yojana, initiatives have been taken to provide loans to them.
However, it was natural for them to face problems due to this decision.
I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance to enter the digital world.
You should also download the banks on your mobile phone and you should also keep a POS machine for credit card.
Let us learn how the unutilised business can be.
See, the way a big mall increases our business through technology, a small businessman can enhance our business through this common "Youjer Friendly Technology".
There is no possibility of getting worse and there is a chance to increase.
I invite you to contribute immensely to the creation of a cashless society.
The roads of technology are safe, strong and water conservation.
I believe that I would like to convey my best wishes to the labourers and the hardworking brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
Friends, You are my soldier and a soldier.
There is a unique opportunity to serve Mother India and the country has got the opportunity to attain economic status.
This is not the world's oldest generation as we experience.
You know what the previous generation did not know.
You know how online banking and online ticket booking are done.
There is nothing special in it.
But today the country wants to do a great job, the dreams of the people, the Cashless Society, it is true that we will not succeed 100 but we have not started it.
If we start the Cashless Society then the goal is not far.
Wallet means e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have a RuPay card.
However, after 8 stars, the poor have also started using RuPay cards and its use has increased by about 300.
As soon as we get a prepaid card for mobile phones and get a prepaid card for spending bank accounts.
This work is so easy that just as we send a Whatsapp.
It is also known that for the uneducated person to forward a suitable WhatsApp.
Moreover, technology is becoming easier so that there is no need for smart phones for this purpose.
Whether it is dhobi, vegetable seller, milk seller or current letter or tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have stressed upon making this system easier.
All banks are working on this.
And now it has been repealed by the All India Online Authorities, we must have read in the current letter of the last two-four days just after using such cards.
The technology that is required to spend online will be in our mobile phone.
Moreover, after taking about half an hour or two hours everyday, we should tell at least ten families that how technology is used, how can we download our banks
We have to lead this campaign to make the country free of corruption, to free the black money, to free the people from difficulties and problems.
If the common man learns this system then perhaps he will get rid of the thinking of the work. And if all the youngsters of India themselves get involved in this work then it will not take long.
Within a month, we can remain a modern India in the world.
And you can do this thing through mobile phones and you can go to 10 houses everyday.
I invite you not only to stop by supporting you, but also to bring about a change in the army.
We should take this forward to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the youngsters have changed the lives of the nation and the revolution was from the youth.
M-PESA created a mobile system that utilised technology and named M-PESA.
This country has brought about a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to work in schools, colleges, universities, NCCs, NSS, collectively and individually.
The most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji is leading the Swachhata campaign.
It is believed that cleanliness is inherent in his absence and that is why he remembered the work of cleanliness on the birth anniversary of his father.
He has written a poem of Harivansh Raiji, a poem of that, a poem of earth, a life of mind, a mera introduction of mera - Harivansh Raiharivansh Rai.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with my thoughts, feelings, letters, my goddess, on Narendra Modi.
At 11 o'clock, the programme of Mann Ki Baat is broadcast but we will be able to hear the translation from regional languages immediately.
In every nook and corner of India, Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm.
India is a country where 365 days of the year is celebrated somewhere or the other in the country.
Festival is the second name of the life of Indians. And it is natural for anyone who can reconcile it.
The tradition of festivals in India has changed since Veda.
But in all these journeys, one thing is noticed that the entire journey of festivals that takes place in India, its prosperity, its impact on the masses, its impact on the masses, has been linked to a common man.
The basic objective of this is to expand the individual and individuality, to try to extend the range of our limited ideas from society to the universe and achieve all these through festivals.
Our ancestors have contributed in the scientific festivals to the festivals that are being celebrated in India, to the extent to which the weather is, what kind of food should be eaten, what kind of crops should be consumed by the farmers.
Today the whole world is talking about the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
The tradition of festivals in India is merely enhancing love for nature, enriching everyone from small children to large.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate the festival of compassion for everyone.
We take leave off on Sundays, but the older generations of Majuri, the Koli Bandhav used to retire on the day of Amavasya and Pornima.
This darkness is not the darkness of light, but it is also the darkness of darkness.
It is an attempt to remove the darkness of the evils of the society, the darkness of the individual, and the light of the positivity by lighting the light on Diwali with the same idea.
The households of the poor are really possessed of soil, but they are clean and shiny in the days of Diwali.
With that vision, Diwali is a mission of cleanliness.
But not only in the house but also in the entire region, cleanliness in the streets and cleanliness of the entire village is the need of today's time.
We should expand this tradition of cleanliness with that attachment.
This festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
In all the countries of the world, Diwali is celebrated in a different way.
Several governments from all over the world want to participate in the festival of Diwali.
Perhaps you would be aware that this year's postal stamps were released by the US postal service.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his photo on Twitter on the occasion of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Briton organised a commendable event to gather all the societies on Diwali in London and participated in it.
There is no single city in Britain that is not being celebrated with great enthusiasm.
What is the photograph that the Prime Minister of Singapore has kept on the Instagram and has shared with the entire world with pride
The 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament.
He told me that the Prime Minister of New ealand had come here recently, and we have to return to New ealand soon to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
I would like to tell you that this festival of light of Deepawali is also a celebration of inspiration for the world community from darkness to light.
In the festival of Diwali along with new clothes and various tasty food items crackers are played with great interest .
It is adventurous to make small kids and young boys snatch .
Sometimes children don't get excited, sometimes they don't get excited, sometimes they try to make a big noise at the same time, and sometimes they invite a great crisis.
Whether the people around us are likely to get fire or not, many times it is not known.
It is a matter of pride for us to take care of such accidents in the days of Diwali.
In the days of Diwali, many doctors are willing to celebrate Diwali with their families.
The festival of Diwali is going on for a long time in our country.
Celebrating Deepawali, we also prepare Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja in the eastern part of India is a great festival, the festival of Mahaotsav is celebrated for four days.
This festival gives a very meaningful message to the society.
Whatever Surya Devata gives us, it is difficult to assimilate what we get from direct and indirect Surya Devata.
Chhath Puja is a festival of worship of Surya .
People worship the rising sun in the world, he added.
But Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the worship of Malata Surya is also done.
A massive social message is also given through it.
In my emotions, it is a feeling of gratitude for the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces of the soldiers. And with the same feeling, I came to my mind that the Diwali of this day should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the countrymen for the Message to Soldiers mission.
Today, I want to bow down to the people of India that there is no feeling of immense love, pride and respect for the people of the country.
The way this spirit has been expressed, every citizen has been given the power of a rapid pace.
Through the messages of all of us, the soldiers of our security forces have got new courage and patience.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, businessmen, shopkeepers, state leaders, sportspersons or actresses, all of them have expressed their feelings.
The media has assumed this occasion as an opportunity to express gratitude to the soldier.
Today we celebrate Diwali, at the same time somebody is standing in the desert, somebody is on the peaks of the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the industries and somebody is watching the safety of the airport.
I can imagine the moment of pride for the soldiers of my country.
Message to Soldiers has shown innumerable sentiments on the hashtag.
I am sure this time that Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem.
I speak Shivani Mohan.
Our fountain bags are being encouraged by the mission of 'To Solzers', which we have launched on this Diwali.
Both my widows and sisters were officers in the army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
We have several officers who have received very good messages in the Armi serum on the border of the country and they are getting a lot of encouragement.
I would like to urge the officers and soldiers of the army to make a huge sacrifice to their families.
Through our messages, the entire army community is getting a very good message and I want to convey my best wishes to you all on Diwali.
Whether it is a natural disaster, a problem in keeping the law and order uninterrupted, a two-handed hand with the enemy or a push to bring back the youngsters on the wrong path, our soldiers continue to work inspired by the feelings of the nation.
I want to tell you about one hour and I want to tell you what kind of inspiration can be given to achieve success.
We have an ITBP force in the security forces, it is a resident of Chhotashah village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
The name of his village is Bada.
Our ITBP jawans had gone to our villages in the vacation.
That is why Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state in a true sense.
A lot of people go to that village.
The engineering students of the city, who were at a distance from that village, had no toilets at this place.
Members of NCC, members of NSS and engineering students decided to build a toilet in this village.
All the goods, vitamins, cement and all the other important things that were required for construction of toilets, these youngsters walked on their shoulders and laid their lives for the entire day.
Autonomously, he built a toilet in that village and these youth showed a small village in the remotest part of the forest free from open defecation.
That is why Kerala will soon become an open defecation free state.
Gujarat has announced that almost 150 open defecation free municipalities, Mahanagarpalika.
10 districts have been freed from open defecation.
Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on 1st November and he has decided to free his state from open defecation within a few months.
So far, 7 districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only a few states.
I convey my best wishes to the citizens of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for their contribution in removing the darkness of the country in the form of unwaveringness.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and after the first scheme, they have to stop the first scheme after completing this scheme.
However, nobody is aware of all these things.
The old schemes are being started, the new schemes are being monitored and the schemes are being monitored continuously.
The households in which LPG is used for cooking in our country, those households which have electricity, do not have the requirement of kerosene.
He has taken a major decision to free kerosene from Haryana.
I believe that Haryana will soon get rid of kerosene.
Only the mediators and the team will be hit by it.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been a guide for all of us.
The need of the hour is to pay attention to the ambitions created in the minds of the poor people of the country.
We have to take a step together to get out of the summit.
Anything originating in our old minds, the difference between the sons and the daughters in the society must be eliminated.
Schools now have free toilets for children and daughters.
This is the opportunity to give our daughter an experience of a distinct India.
It is not right to spread darkness in the village of Sudan after the elimination of the 21st century.
The mission to provide electricity to such villages is being successfully launched.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to such five crore families.
Small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, small shopkeepers, all of them used to get stuck in the evil circles of cooperative business.
The Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Accounts have provided relief to many people through this evil cycle of business.
Direct money is deposited in banks through Aadhaar so that they can reach the beneficiaries directly.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of the common man from the media and the parties.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great personality of this country who dedicated his life for the unity of India.
You will be surprised to know that 31 stars are the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel led his entire life to connect the country and he was successful in his mission, he brought everyone together.
At the same time, Durgadev said that on the same day, Rahul Gandhiji's death took place.
We all know the incident that happened in the country after their death.
Sir, I think that what can be done to stop such an incident
My dear countrymen, this is not just a person's grief.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of unifying the country.
This injustice to Sardar ji on the birth anniversary of Sardar ji is painful for all of us.
We have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
The unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether there are many languages, different castes, different kinds of diets, but the unity of diversity is India's strength, India's specialty, it is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every nook and corner of the country.
It is important to save the country from the ideas and trends that spread the pace.
Sardar Saheb has given us an India, it is our responsibility to make it a great India.
The principle of unity lays a strong foundation for the best of India.
Sardar Saheb's life began to see the farmers' struggle.
But Sardar Saheb took the initiative not only for the struggle but also for the creative work.
I pay my homage to Sardar Saheb and urge you to remember Sardar Saheb on 31st October, wherever you may be.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a festival of light in this phase of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are a guide not only for the entire human race but also for the entire human race.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peaceful unity and harmony were their fundamental mantras.
Guru Nanak Devjis mission was made to free the society from discrimination, superstitions and evils.
Guru Nanak Dev selected Bhai Lalo as his colleague when he had reached the extreme border when he was touched by the untouchables, the caste system and the higher caste system.
Let us move forward with the mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas, which inspires us to ignore and distinguish knowledge like Suddha Guru Nanak Dev ji.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all on this Diwali dedicated to the nation's soldiers.
My best wishes to you all for your dreams, your resolve, your joy and your happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
We have defeated the brave soldiers of our country in the recent terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our soldiers.
He will enhance the efforts of 1. 25 billion people of the country to enjoy these things.
But the Senate does not speak.
Today I want to talk to the people of Kashmir with special significance.
Now the citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national forces.
And as the truth has come to them, they have started moving on the path of peace by separating themselves from these ideas.
Every parents feel that schools and colleges will be working soon.
Farmers want to go to the markets across India.
Financial behavior seems to be smooth.
And for the past few days, this process has started smoothly.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we can collectively find solutions to every problem, take the path and pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the people of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I get the opportunity to know a lot through social media.
It gives the opportunity to understand and understand the emotions of every kind of people in every region of India and it strengthens democracy.
A young man named Harsh Vardhan, who taught Akravati, gave me a different idea.
Then I made a pledge that I practiced three hours a day.
I am a citizen of the country to be useful.
I am glad that you can calmly imagine that at such a young age when you are growing in the atmosphere.
However, I would like to say that the entrepreneurship in the minds of the people of the country is very high.
It is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
This entrepreneurship shows the determination to do something.
Everyone liked to do something or the other.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri had tried to touch this spirit of the country in a very excellent way.
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan had inspired the common man of the country to work for the country.
Every citizen has another way of expressing patriotism in the voices of Bombay and Portuguese, which Lal Bahadur Shastri has shown.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartik has written on the Narendra Modi Movement that the history of our plateau for the Paralympics competition, and the game shown by him is the victory of human consciousness.
Shri Varun Viswanathan has written on the Narendra Modi Movement that our plateau has done a very good job and we should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only are we both, but every individual of the country has been associated with his sportspersons in Paralympics.
Besides sports, this paralysis and the performance of our sportspersons has transformed the vision of humanity into divine vision.
And I cannot forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik had said.
When he won medals, he said that this medal has defeated the integrity.
There is a lot of strength in this bend.
At this time, 19 athletes participated in the Paralympics competition with three women of our country.
In comparison to other sports, when they play differently abled, physical capabilities and skills in sports are more important than this.
You will be happy to know that our sportspersons have earned four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Debendra Jhajriya, who won the gold medal, made a second gold medal in Bhalafek.
And when he was born, he was not wasted, because of the shock of victory, he was struck by one hand.
Just imagine, the person who won the first gold medal in the twentieth year of the age of twentieth year and earns gold medals in the second year of the twentieth year.
Mariyappan Thangvelu won the gold medal in a highly elevated manner.
He does not live in a big city or even in a middle class Shrimant.
In the twenty-first year of age, despite being physically obstacles by lying in painful life, he made the country a medal.
Thilit Deepa Malik has done a lot of hard work for Vijay Dhwaj.
Varun C.
Bhati has won a high-level Kansya medal.
Friends, It is a matter of great pride for a few people to know what kind of valour has been done by these disabled people in the paralysis competition.
I was surprised when I came to know that the sportspersons who had come to the fourth position in the competition to run in the disabled sportspersons did not get the medal, but they completed the race in less time than the sportspersons who won the gold medal in the sufficient race competition.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward to formulate a convenient scheme for Paralympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had experienced a lot of wonders in the new year of Gujarat.
It was an emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibir for persons with disabilities and several gatherings were recorded at that time.
The world cannot see this, Gauri Shardul and that came from the inaccessible forests of Nang district, and the entire Ramayana is poetry.
And I also heard the people gathered there, when people got scared.
On that day, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a book and collected the success stories of the life of the disabled persons.
This experiment was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records .
It is a matter of pride for all our countrymen to have three-thirds of the divyangjans on the same day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on the same day I had said that cleanliness should be a habit and every citizen should have this responsibility.
When two years will be completed on October 2, I can assure you that awareness about cleanliness has increased in 125 crore countrymen.
And I had said - One step towards cleanliness and today all of us can say that everybody has tried to move forward in a pool.
And that is why every citizen, be it general public, be it government offices or be it roads, bus stations or railway stations, schools or colleges, religious places or hospitals, from children to senior citizens, rural poor, farmers, women and every citizen is contributing to cleanliness.
Middle friends have also played a positive role.
I wish that we should go further.
And that is why if we talk about rural India then about two crore three and a half lakh toilets have been constructed so far.
In the states, in the districts and districts, a poor competition has been started in the villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve full success in the Hagunadari-free village campaign.
I convey my best wishes to those who have worked for this.
And I would urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the honour of mothers and sisters, for the health of children.
We should take this pledge forward.
Especially my young friends, I want to present a scheme for those who use the technology in abundance.
If we make a call on this 1969, we will be able to know about the condition of constructing toilets in our cities and also ask for construction of toilets.
We should take advantage of this, especially for the younger generation.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate sector to come forward.
He gave sponsorship to young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
He will be sent to the district as a representative of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Producer companies have been asked to purchase the fertilizer from the waste.
The farmers who do organic farming have been asked to provide that amount.
Those who want to improve the health of our soil, those who take care of the health of the soil, those who have suffered from chemical fertilizers have been given this letter as per the requirement.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing to this task as a messenger of good wishes.
I am inviting youngsters to start new start-ups in the field of waste to wealth and wealth.
This is a sure task.
A special programme Indonesian, India Sanitation Conference is being organised from 25th September to 3rd October this year.
The Prime Minister, the Chief Minister, the Mayor of the Mahanagars, together, will discuss only cleanliness and hygiene.
What can be technology
What can be the economic policy
What kind of public participation can be achieved
How can we create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new things about cleanliness are continuously coming up.
At the same time, I read in the newspaper that students from Gujarat Technological University went to one hundred and seven villages and started awareness campaigns for toilet construction.
He himself suffered and contributed to constructing nearly 900 toilets.
At the same time, we must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh, a pilgrimage from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar was swimming at a distance of 2800 kilometres from Devprayag and he gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have formulated their guidelines.
Each department is focusing on cleanliness by deciding fifteen days.
In the coming October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Department of Panchayat States and the Department of Rural Development will come together to prepare a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And in the last two weeks of October, the three departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and Consumer Affairs will be organising Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective areas from 16th to 31st October.
I urge the citizens to join the department on which we have a respectable relationship.
You must have seen that surveys related to cleanliness are conducted.
Earlier, in 73 cities, what was the situation of cleanliness in the country, the people of the country were asked.
This work will now be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind in this regard.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope that all of us will contribute to this.
The next two October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
I urge you to purchase khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time too, I want to tell you that there should be a single thing of Khadi in your family so that the Diwali can be applied to the poor.
Would you like to participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan on Sunday, 2nd October, as a citizen
For two hours, four hours, you should participate in the work of cleanliness and I would like to tell you that take a photo of it and share it with Narendra Modi.
If you have video then share video.
See, our efforts will give a new strength to this mission across the country.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of giving life is different, whether someone records it or not.
And the responsibilities that he has received will be a great motivation in the national life of India.
Several young, small and big institutions of our country, people from corporate sector, students and NGOs are going to celebrate the joy of guiding wick in many cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
It is his mission to bring food and cloth together to the needy.
I am glad to see that playing on the faces of those poor children.
I believe that in the cities where this joy of guiding is going to be celebrated, the youth should be encouraged and helped.
My dear countrymen, today is the birth anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyay in Pondicherry on 25th September.
Millions of workers like me, who are working with the political think tank, have interpreted it to the political think tank.
He spoke of India's original roots of politics, and gave us the vision for India's cultural heritage.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay is beginning today.
The principle of 'Sabjan Hitay-Sabjan Sukhay' is their gift.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke about the interest of every person in the field.
How to reach the poorest of the poor
He showcased the work of every hand and water of every farm in these two words.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashmi, two years ago, I started talking about Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the ladies for the kind of blessings and blessings that we have blessed during the two years.
I also express my gratitude to AIR because he did not just broadcast the message of Mann Ki Baat but also worked hard to spread all the regional languages to the devotees.
I am also grateful to those workers who have written letters to the government, who have shown the error in the work of the government, who have taken the letters of these letters, who have spoken to the government officials and have made arrangements to solve the problems of the people.
And that is why it is not just about fifteen-twenty minutes of communication, it has become an opportunity for social change.
There can be something more enjoyable than this for anyone.
How will it be a festival connecting humanity
And that power will become the means of true power and then we will celebrate the festival of victory together.
Let us imbibe this power, let us walk with the mantra of oneness.
Celebrate the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja along with peace, unity and harmony for the nation to scale new heights, celebrate the victory of Vijayadashmi.
Prime Minister's Office PM addresses Mann Ki Baat on AIR
My dear countrymen, he is the birth anniversary of Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchandji and also remember his contributions on this occasion.
He played an important role in achieving Indias gold medal in the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932, 1936.
You all are aware of the name of 'Kirna Bradman'.
My dear countrymen, as soon as the time of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, there is a lot of information on the occasion of Mahadev or Narendra Modi.
Besides the cricket, the Indians have so much interest in other games, so much awareness and so much knowledge.
Giving this message to me, he became an inspirational source.
Sachin says, "It is a matter of time to talk about Indus, Witnesses and Deepa Karmakar.
The medals we have received from the daughters.
Our daughters have shown that we are not less than anybody.
One of these daughters is from North India, one from South India, one from East India and one from the other from India.
Therefore, it seems as if this daughter of the entire country has taken a lot of steps to brighten the name of India.
Thakur has written that we have been able to do better than this in the Olympics.
He says, "Congratulations to Hon'ble Modi sir for getting two medals in Rio first.
But I want to concentrate on this thing that was really good for our achievements
And the answer is, no
We need to make a long run in the field of sports.
Our parents are focusing on today's study.
Societies also believe that sports are the drama of time .
We cannot ignore the fact that we cannot accomplish ourselves.
It has been happening in some cases that the sportspersons who were doing good work in India, the sportspersons who performed their sports here did not show up there and only two medals were received in the medal table.
One more thing is that if you don't get medals then you will know that for the first time Indian sportspersons have shown some good activity in sports.
Looking at this, our innovative Bindra ji was at 4th position in Nembaji and he was a medal in a very short span of time.
The same thing happened in tennis, Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
For the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar became eligible for the last round of the track field...
We will be happy to see that after 36 years the women's hockey team has reached the Olympics.
In the last 36 years, for the first time, the Hockey Association has been able to reach the Nock Out Fair.
Our association is strong and it is a part of the pride that Argentina - whoever achieved gold, they fought the same in the entire competition, who was the one who defeated them
Some sportspersons were good, for example Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das...
My dear countrymen, we have to do a lot of things but if we continue to do something and do something then we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
This committee of the Government of India will be conducting a simple exercise and will conduct a study of what is done on sports in the world.
It will create a framework for what we can do.
We have to make plans in a far-reaching manner by 2024.
I also urge the state governments to set up such a committee, what can we do in the field of sports, what can we do in the field of sports
And Im confident that we are a country with 65 per cent youth of the 125 crore countrymen, we are working together to achieve the best in the field of sports.
We have to move forward with this resolution.
My dear countrymen, on September 5th,
For a few years on the occasion of Teacher's Day, I have been giving time to the students and I was spending my time as a student of them.
I was learning a lot from these students too.
On 5th September, this was the Teacher's Day for me and on Education Day.
Therefore, there is a thought in the mind to express my feelings in this matter...
The place where I am in life is also the place of teachers.
I have seen such teachers who are more concerned about our human beings than themselves.
He lives for his disciples and students.
At present, after the Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichand's discussion is on all sides.
They are sportspersons, but they have shown the example of how the best teacher is.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us is always felt.
5th September, the birth anniversary of Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, and the entire country considers this day as a teacher day.
Even if he reached any place in his life, he himself tried to live in the field of teacher.
I have written in such a beautiful handwriting and my own letter is very bad.
And that is why I can see a good handwriting that I have more respect.
If you have a photo on Narendra Modi, along with your teachers, a good memory, a motivational thing, then you must share it.
Keep in mind that it will be valuable for us to see the contribution of teachers from the point of view of students.
Brothers and sisters, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
Ganeshji is a disgust and our people feel that our country, our society, our family, every individual, their lives should be undisclosed.
When we think of Ganesh Festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival has been given to the people.
I want to talk about the topics that touch the lives of the society and the creation of the programmes should be such that the society should get new inspiration and innovation and this self-respect given by them is my birth anniversary.
Today, Ganeshotsav started not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India.
Public issues are discussed, essay competitions, queue competitions are held.
It touches social issues through a artistic framework.
A kind of public education drive is being organised through the Ganesh festival and Lokmanya Tilak has given us the mantra of 'Swarajya'.
Now we have our right, let us move towards Suraj, we have our priority. Can we not give this mantra of 'Suraj' from the public Ganesh festival
I am inviting you.
It is true that this festival is the strength of the society.
Festival brings innovation in individuals and society.
Life is impossible without festivals but it is expected to change as per the demand of time.
This time I have come to know that some people, particularly Ganeshotsav, Dorgapuja, have written a lot about it and they are concerned about the environment.
The idol made from POP is not suitable to the environment.
This pain has been inspired by others as he has done in Mandali.
I pray to all of you to use the idols of Ganesha and Durga Mata like ancient times and do not follow the old tradition.
It is Gods service that protects the surroundings, preservation of our river ponds, protection of the lives that have been deprived of pollution.
I don't know what kind of emotions we will take these issues, but I don't tell them anything but this is the opinion of many.
According to some, Pune's sculptor Abhijit Dhondfale, founder of Kolhapur Nisarg Friends, Science Prabodhini
Environment love and Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
There is a lot of time for Dorgapuzha .
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred on September 4th.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud when Mother Teresa, who served the poor of India throughout her life, receives a Santha.
On 4th September, the delegation of officers under the leadership of the Government of India and Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj will be there on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then there is a big change.
Jan Shakti is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has successfully tried to bring people together for the sanitation of Clean Ganga and Ganga with the help of five State Governments.
This month's twenty stars were invited to the village heads of Ganga coast at Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to all the leaders of Allahabad who came from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and who came from Jharkhand, West Bengal for this pledge.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this vision.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of five states that they have taken a definite step towards the cleanliness drive of Ganga by bringing together the manpower.
Someone from the British had written in Hindi and somebody had written from Chhattisgarh that there should be toilets in our house.
He demanded to build a toilet.
Some kids have written that even if my birthday is not celebrated this year, they will run, but make the toilets sure.
These children from seven to seventy years have done this work.
It had an impression and a passionate effect that on the second day, parents wrote letters to the teachers and they were convinced that we should make a toilet in the house till one star.
Congratulations and special felicitations of those students who have tried for this imagination, they decided to construct a toilet with their children's chitchens.
A sixteen year old Kanya Mallama in this district called Satyagraha against her family.
See the specialty of this village head Mohammad Shafi
He deposited eighteen thousand rupees and built a toilet within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have this pledge.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, every person has been connected in that form and everybody has contributed in any way.
What are the efforts of everyday
The Government of India called upon the people to make a film on cleanliness for two-three minutes and send it to the Government of India.
I would like to tell the television channels that we should also make such competitions.
The imagination of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness drive.
I invite you, my countrymen, there is always a desire that India has always had a relationship with the neighbouring countries.
However, this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are connected with the same cultural tradition today.
They will interact with you and dedicate their imaginations and people from both sides will enjoy the AIR.
All India Radio has a huge contribution towards people-to-people contact.
The President inaugurated the Channel.
Thanks to Bangladesh for working with us for this programme
I also convey my best wishes to all the friends of All India Radio that they are contributing to the Parashtra Policies.
My dear countrymen, we have given me the smoke of the Prime Minister's post, but in the end I am a human being like you.
Sometimes the emotional events touch me more.
I also inspire the Indian people to do something or the other.
He wrote to me a 84-year-old mother-in-law teacher.
Even if I am told that my name should not be announced, I feel like telling him his name.
In the letter, he said that we have requested to give up gas subsidy, at the same time we left the grant and then I forgot it.
However, a few days ago someone of ours came and gave him a letter and thanked me for the Give it up.
This letter from the Prime Minister of India for me is no less than Padma Shri.
My dear countrymen, those who have left the subsidy of cooking gas, have tried to give them a letter, somebody will give me a letter from my representative.
I am trying to give letters to more than one crore people.
He asked me that you are doing a good job, your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of smoke and I will be a psychiatrist and my age will be new in a few years.
I am sending a payment of Rs. 50,000 to help the poor mothers to get rid of the smoke of piles.
You are aware of the fact that a mother who lives up to the pension of a common teacher, who gives 50 thousand rupees for the gas connection of poor mothers, the question is not 50 thousand rupees.
This is the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters that strengthen the faith of my country's future.
He wrote this letter to me not by the Prime Minister, but by the simple letter - Modi Bhai
There have been frequent flood situations in some parts of the country.
State governments, central governments, local autonomous bodies, social institutions and citizens have assisted.
In August 2016, all the political parties, including the parties, who did not give any chance against each other, together agreed to the GST legislature.
Its credit goes to all the political parties and if all parties start moving together then this is an example of how big things were done.
Similarly, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country have collectively taken up a single issue.
Those people who try to create distress by taking these small children forward, they will have to give answers to these children sometime or the other.
My dear countrymen, the country is big, it has been divided by diversity.
It is the responsibility of the government to strengthen the unity of the country by binding this diversely divided country in the bonds of unity, by making it a civil society and by doing so, the future of the country will be brightened.
I have full faith in the power of 125 crore people.
Today morning I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for a while and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports in the whole country will paint every youth in the color of enthusiasm and hope.
We all know that in a few days, the world will have a huge gathering of sports in the world.
The name of Rio will be repeated in our ears.
25 billion people of the country have the responsibility of ensuring the self-confidence of those sportspersons who have gone to play in Rio.
In the coming days, we should do something or the other to encourage our sportspersons.
The sportsperson who reaches the Olympics reaches there only after hard work.
This is a kind of tough penance.
Winning and greening are important, but at the same time reaching that game is more important than that. And that is why all the sportspersons of the country will be congratulating and conveying their best wishes to all the sportspersons for the Rio Olympics.
Today, I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem lover, a student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyaya has sent a poem.
Many of you may be poets who have written poems, maybe even write poems, some people will do that in every language, but the poem that Suraj has sent me is sharing with you.
This young man has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalamji.
But when Abdul Kalamji came to his name, the words of Science, Technology and Missile come forward and the picture of the future-supported India comes in front of him. Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realize the dream of Abdul Kalamji
Ankit ji is right with you
And if we have to go with them or we have to go ahead with them, then we should do research and innovation. And both these things are the souls of technology.
If there is no research or innovation, the same way water produces dirt, the same technology remains an integral part.
If we remain in the world without research and innovation, then the government has taken some steps to create the sweetness of science, technology and innovation in the new generation, so that it becomes timeless in the changing age. And therefore I say that let us innovate the goal of innovation.
And if I say Let us aim to innovate then it means my AIM.
10 lakh will be given to those schools which will create such tinkering labs and Rs. 10 lakh will be provided to them for five years.
On the other hand, India is giving a boost to many problems.
We see problems and difficulties in everyday life.
Now we have to find answers based on technology.
We have called upon the young generation of the country through Atal Grand Challenges to find out the ways of technology, research, innovate and take it to us.
I am glad that the Government of India has encouraged you by giving a special prize to the technology that has been solved on problems and difficulties. And I am glad that people are interested in this thing when we told about the Tinkering Labs.
My dear countrymen, even a few days ago, Ammon was worried about the evil days and in these days we are enjoying rain and the news of floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are doing a lot of work by applying shoulders to assist the victims.
Everyone's mind was happy even if there was some problem due to the rains, the human mind was happy because the center of our entire economic upheaval is rain and the field is spread over it.
Sometimes such diseases come that we have to repent throughout the birth .
But if we remain aware, remain consistent and striving then the ways to prevent them become easier.
We look at the VVP but we sometimes have a little bit of vision in terms of work.
The government, hospitals, doctors, will do their jobs but I urge you to be cautious about not having any disease from the water.
My dear countrymen, we want to take care of ourselves.
Today, life has become very fast, because of continuous running, we dont have time to think about ourselves and ourselves.
If the patient falls sick then he feels that he should recover quickly and for that ntibiotic means antibiotics are taken .
We should not walk on the way to shortcut.
Complete the course of those pills .
Even if you leave half the amount, it will benefit those bacteria, if you take more than necessary, it will benefit the bacteria, hence the course of taking pills has been made as much as possible.
It is necessary to fulfil it, but it is necessary to complete that course.
In medical terms, it is called ntibiotic resistance, how to use ntibiotic, follow its rules.
In the last decade, the maternal mortality rate has come to an end, but even today a large number of pregnant mothers cannot survive.
In pregnancy the amount of blood being less , infection occurring during delivery , high blood pressure , nobody knows how difficult it leads to their life .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign named Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Through this campaign every month's nine stars will be examined at the Government Health Centre for pregnant women.
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I appealed to women patients whether you cannot provide free services to the poor mothers on 9th August.
My doctor brothers and sisters cannot provide 12 days of one year for the poor
There are thousands of such doctors, they have conveyed their best wishes to me and they have written the letters that they have taken forward.
Thousands of such doctors are those who believe in me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective way in the country and the world.
There is no vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
The trees that donate trees are protected by the trees like their own.
But in today's generation, there are people who follow these ideals and bring them into practice.
As per the recommendations of the Mahabharata, it has been stated in the past that even in the trees, the responsibility of the child is fulfilled and Sonal has taken up the feeling of fulfilling the wishes of not only his parents but the entire society.
In Pune, Pune, a farmer from Narayanpur village, Khandu Maratha, performed his nat Sonal inspiring manner.
The temples should start a tradition of planting plants in the rainy season.
Tree plantation can easily become a mass movement.
I would like to tell the farmers that if we damage the land due to damaging on the edges of our farms, can we harvest timber instead of dams
Today, in order to build a house in India, a building worth crores of rupees has to be brought from outside the country.
If we plant such trees that will be useful for the goods and houses of our farmers, we can sell them by the permission of the government, we can get new means of income for them and we can save India from importing food.
In the last few days, the government of India has amended a CAMPA Act and more than Rs. 60 thousand crore is going to the States for tree plantation.
I was told that the Maharashtra government has planted 125 crore trees in the entire state on July 1, and has pledged to plant three crore trees next year.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Maru-Bhumi have done a massive forest festival and has pledged to plant twenty five lakh trees.
This is not a small thing about the five lakh trees in Rajasthan.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they can know what a big step they have taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase the green cover of 50 by 2029.
The Green India Mission which has been launched by the Central Government has been launched by the Railways.
Gujarat has a brilliant tradition of the Forest Festival.
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Van and Shahid Van have been taken up under Van Mahotsav and have been launched to plant crores of trees in Gujarat.
I cannot mention all the states, but everyone is commendable.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
When there is a foreign country, the international policies are talking about trade, security related discussions, some MoUs are going to take place.
But for me the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage.
South Africa says that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and compassion fall on the ears of the world then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela come in front of us.
During my visit to South Africa, he visited the Finnics Settlement, and the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
His visit will always be remembered by me.
Equality and Equal Opportunities are not such a mantra for any society and government.
Equality and compassion take us to a bright future.
All of us look forward to a good life, children want a good future, everybody's needs differ, but the path is the same and this is the equivalent of development, equality, equal opportunity, equality and harmony.
You will be proud of these Indians who have demonstrated this value of life in South Africa.
He told me about an hour, Prime Minister, I am talking about sculptures from Bhubaneswar.
A few days ago, I had read an article in the newspaper that a woman slapped and slaughtered an e-mail of Rs.
As a woman, I was very sad about it.
I want to know your thoughts about this.
Everyone knows this thing that when we get to know about our mobile phones and e-mails then there are messages that you are getting so much money, you pay so much money and take so much money.
If some people fall in love then some people are thrown away with greed.
These technologies are spreading fossils around the world.
Sometimes we are in love.
I believe that we should be cautious of this charm and be aware that if such a fault comes then we should tell our friends and friends that they should make some awareness.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to meet many people during the Parliament session.
Our mainstreamer brings people from their departments, visits and tells them about their problems.
But I had a pleasant experience in these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
You would have seen the enthusiasm of the children and the daughters, they had automatically brought a big album.
Artificial pictures have been painted and painted at the station.
You must visit Aligarh and see this station surely.
This is an example of this that people can change because of their participation.
Thank you very much to all those who have been doing this kind of work in the country, my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, there is a season of eternity in our country along with rainy season.
Festivals are celebrated in fairs, temples, pilgrimages.
You are also being associated with these festivals at home and at home.
Raksha Bandhan is a special significance of our link.
Whether we cannot give this year's Safety to the mothers and sisters of our country as the Prime Minister's Safety Week Scheme or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
Just imagine, let's visit Bahini so that her life will be really safe.
Moreover, if there is a woman who makes her meal at home, who is a woman who cleanses her house, who is a daughter of a poor mother, you can meet her on the occasion of Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
My dear countrymen, many of us are those who were born after Independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country who was born in independent India.
75 years of India's independence and 70 years of India's independence can inspire us, create new zeal and hope. This can be an opportunity for the resolution of doing something for the country.
Freedom is not a government programme, it should be of the people of the country.
It should be our festival like Diwali.
I hope that we too will do some good work to connect with the motivation of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I get the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort.
You must have some things in your mind, your desire, that thing should be engraved from the Red Fort intensely.
You must send me to the Red Fort and give me some suggestions and suggestions.
I invite you to recall the warriors who sacrificed their lives for freedom, remember the great men who lived their lives for India and move forward with a pledge to do something for the country.
Once again I got the opportunity to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
For me there is nothing to do with my mind.
I am keen to interact with you myself.
And I am happy that I can reach every corner of India through Mann Ki Baat to the common man of the country.
I express my gratitude to AIR for the successful efforts made by AIR to broadcast the translation of Mann Ki Baat into the regional language at 8:00 p.m.
And I am glad that those people who listen to my heart's speech programme, through letters and letters, through MyGov, and through a signatory and Narendra Modi puzzle their feelings to me.
I am very useful to run the government on the right issue.
How active should the government be for public welfare
How much priority should be given to the welfare of the people
For this purpose, my conversation with you is very important.
5th June is the World Environment Day.
There are discussions on environmental issues in the world, concerns are expressed.
The main concept of Environment Day is the ero Tolerance for Elligal Wildlife Trade (ELLTTE) which the United Nations has concluded, that is, the trade of wildlife will be fully discussed, but we should also talk about trees and water.
The reason for this is that we must have seen that Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir had been decorated in the forests near the Himalayan Plains.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to save the forests and to save the water.
The Chief Ministers of every state discussed about two-and-a-half hours.
They have heard what they want to say.
Some states, particularly Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have used technology in abundance.
We should also reach other states of the country through the NITI Aayog.
In order to overcome such problems, public participation is the main reason for success.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important.
Therefore, Drop More Crop - Each drop - more production, micro irrigation, micro irrigation, micro irrigation, micro-irrigation.
It is a matter of joy that in many states, the farmers are now using limestone irrigation and micro irrigation and some are using Tushar irrigation.
I also came to know from them that there are big goals in front of many states, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
They are trying to bring two or three lakh hectares of jam under Micro irrigation every year.
This campaign will not only benefit the farmers but will also increase the accumulation of water.
Our bonded Mission Bhagirathi in Telangana has tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers in a better way.
Efforts are being made to recharge ground water with the help of technologies through Niru Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh.
The people of Maharashtra are also providing financial assistance along with labour.
I am sure this movement will be useful for saving Maharashtra from future water conservations.
The State of Chhattisgarh has taken the initiative of Loksurajya-Jalsurajya Movement.
A massive campaign has been launched to revive the archaeologists of Rajasthan and Gujarat where they belong to the ancient times.
However, in some parts of that state there is water conservation.
A big work is being done by constructing small bundles and checkhams there.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is plenty of water , that is why we did n't get water after the end of the monsoon so how would it go on
And water is not limited to farmers only.
This is a matter of concern with the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the Shrimanta-Grib.
Therefore, when the rainy season is coming, the water should be our priority and when we celebrate Diwali, how much water should we save in the rainy season
You will see that your joy will increase manifold.
And this is not just the government but also the work of the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
Our India is going to be transparent.
They are going to reach India from one end to the other.
We have to change our old habits to do this.
Today, I want to touch upon a topic that if we help me then we can go to that direction successfully.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards a cashless society.
We can earn money and send money through electronic technology.
There is no fear of going to your pocket churie, there is no concern in keeping hiccups.
So it will be recorded on its own.
It will be a bit difficult to start using this method but once the habits are over, this system will be smooth.
This is possible because in the last few days the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country have been opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
On the other hand, the Aadhaar number has also been received and the mobile is now in the hands of almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhar-Mobile-Jame (J.
We can move towards a cashless society by putting an end to it.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with Jan Dhan accounts.
In the coming days, it will be useful for both card credit and debit.
And a small machine has also been made available to P.
Oh.
You can use Aadhaar number, RuPay card and others by using this machine.
One of the initiatives taken by the Government of India is how to provide money through POS.
We have taken the second initiative and bank on mobile.
It will be very easy to dedicate the money through your mobile phone.
In a way, this is the step taken by the bank in this direction.
The work is underway to provide banking services in the post office.
If we learn to use these methods in practice, if we habit them then the need for direct movement will not be removed.
Businesses will be automatically transparent and transparent.
The behaviour of two numbers will stop.
The result of black money will also be reduced.
Therefore, I would urge the countrymen to start this thing.
You see, once this system has been started, we should move forward with ease of doing business.
Whether it had been twenty years ago or not, all these mobile phones would have been in our hands.
Gradually it is not possible to stay without it .
It is possible that the cashless society will be gradually shaped.
However, it will be better if it comes to light in a short time.
We must encourage our sportspersons participating in the Rio Olympics and enhance their confidence.
He was the Chief Minister.
But he was the Minister of the Government of India at the same time.
Do they get nutritious food according to necessity
Whether the trainees who want to be trained for their fitness or not
I am glad to see that in the event of elections, the possibility of assigning new responsibilities as the Chief Minister is so awakened as a Sports Minister in such a cooperative environment.
When 125 crore Indians are standing with us, this belief is a big force for our sportspersons and their self-confidence is blessed.
Last time, I had taken up the topic of FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup.
I got information about it from all over the country and during this period I got to see that the atmosphere of football has started throughout the country.
Many people are formulating your association with initiatives.
I have received several information about Narendra Modi Power.
It is possible that many of them were not playing games, but it was a pleasant experience for me to like playing games in the minds of thousands of youngsters of the country.
You are familiar with Cricket and India, but I have seen how much faith you like about football
Everything should not be counted as victory and defeat.
With sportspersonship, India should create its identity in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen that we should do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm for our colleagues in the field of sports.
For the last eight-ten days, a new nikal has been coming to a place or a place.
I am not talking about election results, I am talking about those students who have studied year after year.
It is now clear that the tenth anniversary of Ekmago Mag has started coming together and our daughter is showering valour.
It's a matter of happiness.
We must move forward with confidence.
But I have come up with a new kind of question and I have never thought about it.
I felt very fond of reading this.
He said that when I went home after getting 89. 33 marks, I felt that there would be a lot of praise for me all around, but whenever I got the house, I said that if there were four qualities more then it would have been 90.
But I feel sorry.
I have read your letter Barkai and I believe that this pain can not be yours but millions and millions of students like you.
This is because the environment has been created so that we can find out more error than enjoyment.
This is the second form of negativity.
I would like to urge the people of the neighborhood to welcome the children who come with their fate.
Otherwise, there will be a day when you will get 100 percent of the qualities. And even then someone will say that it is true that you have achieved 100 percent of the qualities.
Therefore, it is necessary for every thing to have a limit.
The Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written the same letter.
He says that the people near him are not ready to smoke his nickel.
They say that something else would have been better and something would have been better.
I would like to tell you that in such a situation you should not allow yourself to flourish.
Everyone expects, listen.
Staying firm on your own resolve and also trying to do something better.
But if we don't accept any solution to what we have achieved then we will never be able to create new things.
And that is why I would urge you to sing the songs of success that has been achieved.
Those who do not get good qualities in the field of sports, goes ahead in the field of music, moves forward in the process of artwork, moves forward in the business.
God has given everyone some skills.
You will be able to recognise your inner strength and fill yourself with it, you will progress in life.
There was a time when the saints used to be an integral part of Kashmir's folklore.
But Pandit Shivakumar, who took this plaque, became an important phrase in the world music sector today.
In the field of Indian music, there was a limited scope for this play.
During the reign of King Maharaj there was a place of honor with the entrance door of Darbar .
However, Ustad Bisimilla Khan took this phrase in hand and kept Saila Now at this height of a great musician from all over the world.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I realize that the expenditure on medicines in the poor families of our country is going to bring about the financial burden of that family.
And it is true that the cost of not being sick is very low but after falling sick the health becomes the first time but it costs a lot.
We should not commit ourselves to such a lifestyle that we will not be able to cure the disease and we will not bear the financial burden of our families.
One is cleanliness is the most important way to stay away from this disease.
If someone can serve the poorest of the poor, then it is cleanliness.
And the second thing is Yoga for which I constantly urge.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
All over the world is an attraction for Yoga and the world has embraced it.
Our ancestors have given us this unique gift that we have given to the world.
The stressed world gets the strength to live a balanced life.
It is easy for people associated with Yoga to be healthy, balanced, to be inclined in the minds of the desired ones and to concentrate in every work.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes a collective environment can transform the lives of a person.
I hope that we will do something about it on 21st June.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we use this day on 21st June for Yoga in our lives
Can we do yoga in our social life
I request you not to stay behind.
It is extremely important for India to be healthy.
My dear countrymen, I am constantly associated with you through Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I had given you a mobile name and by giving a missed column we could hear the words of mind.
But now it has been made easier.
Whenever we talk about Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed column on this number, we should listen to that language.
Hello.
We are determined to do a lot of things during the times of holidays.
The programme comes to an end and during these holidays the weather becomes pleasant as an ambay, it feels like taking the blessings of ambrosia, it will be barren if it comes to a little time in the afternoon.
But this time it has enjoyed a lot of joy.
It is natural to have a climate of care throughout the country.
And whenever there is constant misery in it then water conservation starts flowing .
Sometimes due to hurdles, sometimes due to hurdles, sometimes due to obstructions due to obstruction, there is less water conservation in the reservoir.
And this happens year after year, the water conservation capacity decreases.
Even if this is the case, I have seen that the citizens also make a lot of efforts for this.
In many villages, awareness is seen and the real value of water is the same as those who have faced the crisis of hydro-power.
And there is sensitivity to water conservation and there is also the ability to do something about it.
A few days back, I was told that the theme of 'Heavar Bazar Gram Panchayat' in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the villagers there have been handling the water with a very sensitive approach.
He decided not to lose any such crop, whether it is water, yarn or banana.
It feels very easy to hear this but it is not as easy as it is.
What would everyone have made a big pledge together
He took the lead in irrigation, hydro-irrigation, water conservation and water conservation and today this village has remained self-sufficient for water conservation.
It is true that I am telling you about this small village of Hivarebazaar but I convey my best wishes to all such villages and their best work.
He built about twenty-seven farms.
As a result, ground water level has increased, water level has risen.
When the crops need water, they got water and said a lot of statistics.
The income from farming has increased by twenty percent.
With the increase in water level, the quality of water improves.
However, several such initiatives are being run by the citizens who never come forward.
If the government has made a good campaign then sometimes it gets fame but if we look around it then we will see how people try to find ways to overcome this problem through innovative solutions.
It is a human nature that whenever there is any problem, the feeling of elimination of all the problems will emerge in mind.
In the rainy season, there will be 106 to 10 per cent rainfall, it has been observed everywhere.
It's still time to rain, but it will bring a good rainfall.
Can we take any money from now on to save water in the village
The farmers need soil and it is useful for the crops.
And if we take out the garbage in the villages then it will be beneficial for the farming and it will increase the capacity of water conservation in the fields.
There will be water in our villages.
Today, there is a crisis of water, it is a state of misery, but the next month-and-a-half months are in our hands.
Their concern is social because this work has been going on for nearly thirty years.
Several governments have come and several schemes have been completed so much money has been spent.
Ganga gives us a blessing, Ganga gives us employment, it gives us a new strength to live with Ganga.
Ganga provides a new momentum to the economic development of the country as it flows.
And today we need crores of Bhagiraths to save them.
This mission will never succeed without public participation.
Several efforts are being made in this regard at the government level.
Efforts are being made to get support from the states of Ganga.
Efforts are being made to include social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of Ganga clean and to stop industrial pollution in the waters of Ganga.
Everyday dense garbage flows through the drains and drains of the Ganges.
In order to clean this waste, the work of cleaning waste on water at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna is done with the help of trash skimmer.
This has been made available to all local administration institutions and they have been asked to clean garbage using it.
And I was told that everyday 3 tons of waste is removed from the place where these efforts are being done in a better way.
That is, it is true that the dirt that is going on at such a large scale has stopped from rising.
In the coming days, there has been a plan to set up a trash skimmer at some other places and people living in Ganga and Yamuna will be able to experience it soon.
To tackle industrial pollution, an artificial framework has been prepared with paper-lagada industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar factories.
Today, I believe that it will have a good result.
Forgetting the waste material from the paper factory is now on the way to close down.
This is the symptom that we are stepping in the right direction and awareness has also increased in a way.
And I have seen that if a person visits me in the southern part of Ganga then he will definitely say that the Ganga will be clean.
This belief of the common people will succeed in achieving the mission of Ganga cleanliness.
People are giving donations in the work of cleaning the Ganga.
This work is going on in a better way.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayat Raj Diwas in India.
This is the beginning of the Panchayat Raj system in our country.
And gradually the Panchayati Raj system spread across the country has been successfully working as an important component of our democratic system.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit this place on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar and his birthplace.
I got the opportunity to bow down to that holy land and today I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Diwas in the state of Jharkhand where our tribal brothers and sisters live in large numbers.
He also interacted with all Panchayats across the country at 3:00 in the afternoon.
This campaign has done a great job in creating awareness.
How can a democratic institution be empowered at a village level in every corner of India
How will the village be self-reliant
Foodgrains were taken up in some villages.
The awareness that has come from the villages is the essence of India-Uday.
Gram Uday is the basis of India-UDAY.
Therefore, if we stress upon the rise of village then we will not be able to achieve the results.
Gharpure phoned Sharma from Mumbai and expressed concern in his mind.
I am talking to Sharma from Mumbai.
My question is on school and college education.
There is a need for reforms in the education sector for the past several years.
Not getting proper school or college or status of education .
Even after completing their children's education, they don't know a lot of things, so that they are left behind in the world.
What are our ideas about this
Today, every family has the biggest dream of mothers and sisters that is education of children.
The parents should raise their concerns about how to teach, educate children and how to get good education. And I believe that those families who have the feeling of awareness, the result of this is seen on the school.
Every government in our country has emphasized on education and every government has made efforts for it in its own way.
However, the more important it is to improve our education system.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our priority should be to provide quality education to the literacy mission.
Today, we have to pay attention to the formulations that have been counted today.
Today, how many children have come to school.
Now we will have to focus on those children who have come to power, they will get good education and proper education.
You must have seen in this government's budget and efforts have been made to provide good education.
We have been told to free 10 government universities and 10 private universities from government control and come at a challenging, competitive level.
Should we work to be the best university
This scheme has been implemented with the aim of giving them complete freedom.
At the same time education is as important as education.
I have been thinking about a case since last few days.
He wrote on the Web Portal MyGov, some people wrote on my Narendra Modi Movement, and many young people write on it.
Hon'ble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am talking to Mona Karnawal from Bijnor.
Along with education, the sports sector is also very important for the youth of today.
They should have a common feeling, a good leadership, which will lead to their all-round development.
I want to encourage more and more youth and the government also encourages NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
One day I came to my mind to speak to you and talk to you all about it.
And when I asked him that earlier this kind of meeting was held, his reply was that this is the first such meeting since independence.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all the youngsters and young friends who have come to me in the context of all these things.
If you have done a lot of work on your own level, but in a collective way, our organisations have worked in a comprehensive manner, then how big can we get the results
Now it is true that I automatically become the Cadet of the National Cadet Corps.
I got the benefit of this childhood and I believe that there should be a new consciousness in such organizations.
I have put forward some issues in this meeting.
Many things have been discussed with him.
We have several youth organizations, what innovations can be brought about in their programmes and programmes
If we write this on my Narendra Modi Movement, I will go to the right place and I believe that after this meeting all these things will get a boost.
I believe that it will be possible for you to associate yourself with all these things.
My dear countrymen, I want to tell you one thing that you will run away to think.
I believe that it is a matter of awakening to all of us.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that what party will provide gas cylinders during the last several elections
And every political party felt that if the middle class had to wait for elections, then gas cylinders were a very important issue.
This is a global experience.
However, it has never been considered outside this post.
Today, my countrymen, I am happy to seek my hub in front of you.
I chose a different path and that was the way to trust the masses.
Sometimes we have to rely more on our people than on ourselves.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
Grant in our country was denied when it was an equation.
I would particularly urge all the political parties to say that everywhere we should talk about the importance of trusting the people.
We will get the result that we have never thought.
We should go in this direction.
And I always feel that as if I have come to my mind, what should I eat for third and fourth class jobs
Keep faith in those who have been sent by testing and gaining qualities.
Sometimes I feel that we should declare that there is no temptation on this one line of railways.
This is in my mind that there cannot be any government rules but the environment of trust can be created.
And those who created this environment are not political leaders but one crore families of the country have prepared it.
Every breaking on every newspaper and channel is neugligible.
Isn't there anything good about us in this country that has 100-125 crore population
Please change the situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his intense condolences, but I believe that this anger is not on me but on the situation of Bhotal.
You must remember that our mother, Dr. A.
I have seen that some television channels have made positive statements specific.
In today's era, a positive atmosphere is being created.
Everyone feels that they should get good news and good news.
It is true that the bigger person, the best thing, the best words, the best words will be told in a better way, the more the result is the positive outcome of the positive situation.
It is true that if we put more emphasis on goodwill then we will not have enough space for evil things.
If there is a Deep Petwa then darkness will go away and it will happen.
And that is why we might think that the government has started a website called Transforming India.
Not only the government but also the citizens.
And this is such a portal on which we can send a good report to you.
You can contribute.
Ravi ji has given you good information, but please do not follow me.
Kumbh is the speciality of our country.
Kumbh can be a center of attraction for tourists .
People from all over the world knew that for such a long time, crores of people come to the river bank.
In the peaceful and peaceful environment Sohal is celebrated .
In order to organize such events, people will be able to set up new parameters in terms of planning and planning.
For the last two days, I have been watching that many people are uploading photographs of Kumbh.
I believe that the tourism department of the Government of India has taken competition from the tourism department of the state government and should urge people to upload the best photographs.
It is not just that cleanliness should be there, but those who return from there will take the message of cleanliness.
I feel that Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual fair but we can transform it into a social society.
I am glad that the things in our minds have connected my mind with a unique relationship and once again many thanks.
You and I have always waited for Mann Ki Baat.
At the same time, I have seen several letters, reactions, phones, information and inspiration - everybody wants to do something or the other - one feels a feeling. And there is a lot in all these things that I want to incorporate, but there is a limit of time, that is why I cannot incorporate all of them.
Yet, you have the desire to confine yourself to this Mann Ki Baat once again.
You must remember that in the last few years, I had talked about Premchand ji's book and we had decided to share some of the books that I read through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me to talk about some more books.
But one thing should be accepted by me that I cannot give time to write a book on a very large scale.
But one advantage is that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of many books on what you write and send.
However, I feel that we should take this initiative forward from the experience of the last one month.
We will build a corner of books on Narendra Modi App and write, discuss, discuss and suggest a good name for the corner of these books.
And I am feeling that today the minds of Indians have been solved on the subject of water.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
The media has launched several innovative missions on water conservation.
Be it the government or the NGOs, they are doing something or the other on the battlefield.
The rural people have worked hard to give a definite direction to a waterfall that flows through the mountains.
And that too pure Swadeshi.
This has not only prevented the loss of soil smoke and crops, but also provided water to the farmers.
All of you will be happy to know that the state of Meghalaya is the first state in the country to formulate a water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
Farming of such crops is being encouraged in Haryana and the farmers dont have any harm.
Many fairs are held on the occasion of Sanskrit.
Do not use these fairs for water conservation
Every layer of the society is going on in the fairs.
In these fairs, we can deliver the message of water conservation very effectively, we can fill the exhibitions, play streets, we can deliver the message of water conservation with festivals in a very simple way.
In fact, the World Children Winners Sports Competition was held in Moscow this month.
This is a sports activity in which the youngsters from cancer are those who have emerged from cancer in their lives.
In this competition, competitions like neembaji, intellectual, water conservation, running, football and table tennis were organized.
All these 10 winners of our country won medals in this event.
Some sportspersons have won more than one medal.
Sanjiv Haripura of Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Dada of Kolkata, P.
Several such people from different parts of the country have written to me on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
As a matter of fact, this year has been a very long journey for India in terms of space progress.
Our scientists left ASAT in March and after that Chandrayaan-2.
However, during the elections, there was not much talk of big and important incidents like ASAT.
With the help of ASAT spacecraft, in just three minutes, we achieved the ability to build a satellite at a distance of 300 kilometers.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve such success and now on July 22, the entire nation, Chandrayaan-2 has taken steps from Sriharikota to space.
The photos of the Chandrayaan-2 flight filled the countrymen with pride and zeal.
Chandrayaan-2, this Mohim is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-II will further clarify our understanding of the Moon.
With this, we can get more affordable information about the Moon, but if you ask me what two things I can learn from Chandrayaan-2 then I will tell you, these two things are Feth and Fearlessness i. e.
We must believe in our talents and capabilities and trust our talents and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
He is an Indian in both heart and soul.
There is a mission of the entire indigenous system.
When there was talk of innovation and innovation in the new sector, our scientists were the best and the world class.
The second important faction is that there is no need to fear any crisis.
This work is unprecedented in the manner in which our scientists can solve all the technological questions by record time and night.
All the world has seen this great penance of scientists.
It should be a matter of pride for all of us and the time has not changed due to the difficulty of reaching the moon.
We have to face many temporary setbacks in our lives, but always keep in mind that we had the ability to fight them.
I am confident that Chandrayaan-2 will inspire the youth of the country to innovate science and innovation.
In the end, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting for the month of September, when the Lander-Vikram and Rover-Prayag will land on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the youth and youth of the country by giving information about a very entertaining competition to the students and youth of the country.
I urge the young friends and students to participate in this quiz competition and make your participation more entertaining and unforgettable.
I specially urge schools, administrators, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to take a lot of hospitality to win their school.
The most thrilling thing is that the students from every state will take their own expenses to Sriharikota and when they will land on the surface of the Chandrayaan moon in September, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment.
For these victorious students, this is a historic event, but for that you will have to participate in the uiz Competition, you will have to gain maximum qualities and you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have done a survey.
Our mindset has given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and the efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired the mind.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting up new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of many.
We have achieved the ideal condition in terms of cleanliness, not just the roots, but the way we have achieved the success in cleanliness from the villages to the public places, it is the power of the resolution of the 125 crore countrymen, but we will not stop coming here.
This campaign has now started moving forward from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching the story of Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has returned to India to serve Mother India, leaving her job in the US.
He took the initiative to make Delhi clean, not only beauty but also beauty.
In his meeting, he started from the garbage collections of Lodhi Gardens.
Through street arts, many parts of Delhi are decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he started showing his art from the walls of overbridge and school to the slums, people also got the courage and in a way this silos started.
You must remember that during the Kumbh, Prayagraj was decorated with paintings on the road.
I understand that Yogesh Saini and his comments also played a very important role in this thing.
The words of Indradhanush are more effective than thousands of words and we also experience it in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of wealth from waste in our society.
If we talk about it then we have to move forward from waste to gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting response to my govt.
This was the response of Bhai Mahmood Aslam, who lived here in Shapia, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, "Mann Ki Baat" programme is good.
I am happy to say that I have played an active role in organizing the Bank to Village programme of Community Mobilization in Jammu and Kashmir in my state.
At the same time, online monitoring of the programme should also be arranged.
I believe that this was the first such programme in which the people directly interacted with the government.
Brothers and sisters, when I was reading this message, I was eager to know about the Bank to Village programme and when I got a detailed information about it, I felt that the entire country should know about it.
This programme imagines how enthusiastic and enthusiastic the people of Kashmir are connected to the mainstream of development.
Several topics like literacy, sex quality, health, hygiene, water conservation, electricity, water, mulinary education and uestions of senior citizens were discussed.
Friends, This programme was not just a formality of the government but the officials returned to the village for a long time, but this time the officers had done a work in Panchayat for two days and they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
Under Khelo India, children were sportspersons.
The sports literature, the Job Card of MNREGA and the certificates of caste and tribe were also released.
The people of Kashmir participated in this festival of development with openness.
It is a matter of joy that the 'Bang to Village' programme was organised in such far-flung areas where the government officials had to pave the way for a day and a half.
These officers also went to the Panchayats on such borders, where there is a constant fear of the Pillars on the border, not only did they go to the highly sensitive areas of Shapiyan, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officers were so heavy that they had stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is a matter of great pleasure that a large number of people will participate in the Gram Sabha in these states and plans for themselves.
It is also clear that people are trying to create awareness on the path of development, they are trying to earn money, they are not able to succeed in their own ways.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, who honoured the Gyanpeeth Awards, has given a glimpse of the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he said, Hodige Madige Agyed Language, the land of Adrag is sown. In fact, the rains and the streams of water are arsenals and the earth is enchanted by their beauty.
In the whole of India, Alga culture and speakers celebrate Shravan month in their own ways.
When we look around in this season, we feel that the earth has laid the shadow of greenery.
There is a process of new energy everywhere.
In this holy month many devotees visit Kavad and Amarnath Yatra while some people fast regularly and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagapanchami.
During this period, the festival of Rakhipurnima symbolizes the love of brother-in-law.
If we talk about the month of Shravan, you will be glad to know that this time the most emotional participants of the Amarnath Yatra have participated in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since July 1.
The more emotional the participants participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, the more emotional they have participated in just 28 days.
I also appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their intimacy for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The people who come back from the journey are burdened with the feelings of love and affection of the people of the state.
These things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have also been told that more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in one and a half months since the start of Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year.
First of all, such record number of pilgrims have reached there after the alarming disaster in 2013.
I appeal to all of you that you must go to those parts where the natural beauty was seen during monsoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the spirit of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage are no longer a teacher.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for this beautiful and comfortable month of Shravan.
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of uit India Movement.
I would like you to make some special preparations for the 15th of August and find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
When we watch the television then we see only one foot of the rain - on the other hand we will have to come out with our families to see the entire water, the water, the traffic shrubs and the other pictures of our farmers, our birds, the flowing waters, the flowing waterfalls, the slopes of green grass.
Rainfall, freshness and happiness, both fresh and fresh.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of hard work to start the Mann Ki Baat.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, you live in the field.
Today, we are often waiting for a combat between India and Australia.
India has won the fight against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The time has come for a new revolution in the world.
And we see that in India, a nutritious climate is being created for cricket, football, hockey, tennis and junk.
Perhaps you might have come to know that India has the honour of the World Football Competition under the 17th Annual Rainfall of 2017.
There are 24 associations worldwide to play in India.
On the other hand, I see that the attraction of football in the youth is increasing, whether it is EPL or the Spanish League or the Indian Superlig.
Young friends take time to know about these conflicts and see them on a far-flung movie.
How did the competition for self-connecting with sports in governance, educational institution and social organisation stand
We see all this happening in the case of cricket.
But we have to create this environment in terms of other sports.
This is a golden feature to identify India.
My dear students, we must have decided on tourism during these holidays.
And I remember that the work that we did not accumulate to our tourism department, our cultural department was not possible, the state governments were not able to do it and the government of India did it by crores of tourists.
India is full of diversity.
Perhaps there is no such district in India where I have not gone.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
I am glad that nearly 10,000 citizens have visited the Kolkata Khani near Nagpur as a tourist.
Some of the efforts are being made by both the tourists and tourists .
All the efforts have been made without any scientific pattern.
Can we also take special care of this
I believe that my young friends will help me in this work.
Employment generation is possible through tourism sector.
India is far behind in comparison to the world in terms of tourism.
But if we set a target of 125 crore Indians in the tourism sector then we can attract the world towards India.
The biggest heritage of the tourism sector of the world can attract our country and provide employment opportunities to millions of youngsters of our country.
Be it governance, institution, society or citizens, we all have to do this together.
Let us strive towards this thing.
My young friends, I don't think this has happened.
If you do not get swimming then you will be able to learn to swim in these beds.
If cycling is not being carried out in these beds, then the cycle is not being used in these beds.
Even today, while typing computers on computer, I do with two fingers, shouldn't I learn to do clean typing
There are many skills for our personality development.
You will be able to see that after the start of the school and after the start of the college, you will return there and tell your friend that I have learnt this in this holiday, if you don't learn anything then he will say.
My time has come for you but you have come to learn new things.
Friends, this will be discussed in a positive way.
This time several information has been received on mygov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji.
In the background of sunrise we had told that chimneys also have the problem of sunset so that they keep water filled in a utensil on their balcony or glasses for chimneys .
I did the same thing and I was glad to tell you that I had a friendship with Chimanya.
He called me and reminded me of a tricky job.
I had noticed the last time and I had said that during sunrise keep water filled with water for the parties in the utensils of the soil.
The actor told me that he does this throughout the year and he has been friends with many eminent personalities.
He loved the great poet Mahavir Verma and the birds of Hindi literature.
He had written in his poem, "Do not let you go away, I will fill the courtyard with donors and I will fill the hod with salt and sweets.
We should also do this thing by Mahadevi ji.
I congratulate and thank you for taking into account a very important issue.
Have we ever given water to them in the days of sunrise
I am extremely grateful to you all for the craftsmanship and for the sake of a sensitive subject.
However, this is a habit in India.
But I express my gratitude to you for seeing this story of craft.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people believe that Digital India is the world of youth of the city.
But this is not the case.
You will be happy to know that a farming facility has been prepared for your service.
If we download the farming facility in our mobile phones then we will be able to know about the farming and climate very easily.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this facility on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, the season of sunrise for others is the season of vacation but the time for farmers to sweat is the season of sunset.
He looks forward to the monsoon.
The period before the start of the climate of agriculture is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think about what will happen with water.
The water streams flowing through the ponds, the water streams in the ponds, the waste stored or some surroundings, the water logging stops and as a result of this water storage gradually decreases.
In the first rainy season, if the water is saved, the pond is filled, the river is filled, then even if there is no rain, then there will be less damage.
This time we have seen that we have decided to prepare 5 lakh farmers.
Emphasis has been laid on water conservation through MNREGA.
There will be so many villages across the country, how many progressive farmers, how many aware people who have done this thing.
However, today there is a need to do more work.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you one more thing today that the Government of India had organised an agricultural magnificent exhibition at the earliest.
I have seen how modern technology has come into agriculture.
However, it is still left to purify them directly to the fields.
Now the farmers have started using the fertilizer as well.
This mantra should be followed and our agriculture sector should move forward by using scientific methods.
I hope that we will complete the necessary tasks for water conservation in the next one or two months.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
Victory on diabetes is a declaration of World Health Day.
It is said that in 2014, the institution of patients of diabetes in India was as many as 1. 5 crore.
3 of the deaths due to deaths have resulted in diabetes.
The entire world is reflected in diabetes, hence, on the 7th of April, the World Health Day, the concept of victory over diabetes has been decided.
We all know that our lifestyle Type 2 is the main cause of diabetes.
If you like yogasana, then do yogasana.
Otherwise do exercise like walking , running .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We are sometimes hesitant to pursue healthcare.
And when it gets very bad then it is realized that diabetes has slackened our body a long time ago.
This means that this is a disease which can be tested quickly.
My dear countrymen, we have a lot of work on this thing.
I would like to urge you to make a complete upgradation of tuberculosis or diabetes.
Therefore, I urge all the countrymen to get rid of tuberculosis to overcome diabetes.
The birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
His 150th Birth Anniversary was celebrated across the country.
One Panchteerth - his birthplace of Mahu .
He took a higher education in London, Nagpur, where he witnessed it.
I am fortunate to visit Mahu on Babasaheb Ambedkar's birthplace.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to become an excellent citizen.
We can dedicate ourselves to a better citizen by following the path shown by him.
In the last few days, record sustainability will start and new record sustainability will come.
They are celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can hear on your mobile phone.
We just want to give a missed call.
Make a missed call according to your convenience.
You might have heard the earlier programme of Mann Ki Baat, you can hear it in your language.
I am happy to be with you through this.
My dear countrymen, many best wishes to you all.
How can this World Cup enhance the interest of sports among the youth of India
We should also participate in this.
He sent photographs of such places and uploaded Photos that he really enjoyed seeing them.
If you want to see something then you should first create the vision of seeing it.
They should have the desire to reach out to anyone who has not gone before.
Western Coal Fields Limited, Sawaner Sthal near Nagpur, is a mine of coal.
When people go to tourist places then they buy something or the other.
Even if he is poor, he will spend more.
I call upon you for a time to think.
Would you like to compile some new art, some skill in your personality for accomplishing something new
Do not increase your strength
Do you like to paint , but do you not come .
Hey, let's start, let's go.
For personality development, learn new arts, use vacations to enhance skills.
There are countless areas.
The architecture cook of Mysore has presented a sensitive issue to all of us.
If you ask them a question then they answer it and explain it to us.
And if we use it once then what is our use in it
And if you want something then you should complain to me.
I want to save water from villages.
How can water drops be saved in the coming rains
How can the water of the village be kept in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have made our landscape sick by the use of hypertension of letters.
But if you use the best spice basumer then will you like to eat food
You will not like the same food.
But today we have become ineffective in terms of tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to my mind on radio.
You must have the idea of exams now.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I believe that the more you take care of your children's exams.
But if we change our approach to look at the exams then we can be free from worry.
I had told you in the background of the programme that send me your experiences, your information on Narendra Modi Power.
I am glad that the teachers, the students who have achieved the best in life, the students of the society have written many things on this aspect and sent them to me.
Today, I want to talk to the parents, students and teachers especially in my mind programme.
I will tell you something about what I have heard and read. I will also tell you what I feel.
But I believe that this 25-30 minute interaction will certainly be useful for those students who are going to meet the examination.
My dear student friends, before I talk to you, what would be useful to them when I started speaking to you
Their experience will certainly be useful to you.
I am aware that testing will start in a few days.
Some of you must be under stress.
I have only one message.
You will expect your parents, your teachers, other members of your family and your friends.
Wherever you go, how is your preparations going on in all the thoughts
How many qualities will you get
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations from them.
There have been many difficult moments in the 24 years of GAILA and several times there have been good moments.
However, there was always the expectations of the people and as the time progressed, the hopes continued to grow.
And I need to find a solution for that.
Then I thought that I had myself kept my expectations and set myself a target.
My attention was focused on consciousness and then all the goals were achieved from us.
Friends, what did Tandulkar ji say
Don't go under the scanner of expectations.
You have to bring about your future.
Should we spend our time in competing with others
You will see that no one will be able to stop you from going ahead and you will be able to achieve even more success than the success achieved earlier. You will not need to depend on others to enjoy it.
You will experience self-confidence.
Friends, I don't want to be a game of qualities and statistics.
Where to go, how much did you get
Or don't stumble.
It is known from these exams, is it right for yourself whether it is correct
And that is why if your dream is immense, it will be a celebration of happiness on your own.
And that is why what will happen this year
Do not keep yourself limited at all .
Let us move forward with a greater objective in front of us, and even if there is less success than expected, we will not be disappointed, we will get inspired to do more forcefully and more.
Thousands of citizens have written small issues from their mobile phones.
In fact, the entire year, 365 days, our daily routine, our dreams and resolves must be fulfilled.
Shri Prabhakar Reddy telephoned me for a matter of time and asked him to rise early and light up the study.
Prabhakar Reddy says that the testing centre should be delivered on time with entrance and other requirements.
Perhaps I have not done this thing because I am not serious about sleeping.
And there is a complaint of my many friends that I do not sleep enough.
During the exams, I am talking about sleeping so that you can test the stress-free situation.
You will not do this .
I don't believe it.
It is an important reason for success to be strong in life.
Not only this, the daily routine also worsens.
Therefore, don't understand anything small or small.
Decide, do it.
The negative effects of stress on these tensions are on their fate.
And on the strength of the study that I have done, I leave any question paper Solaven with such confidence that if any question paper comes in the form of a question paper then it will be decided.
Let us know from them the way to achieve success by cutting off this scope.
Namaskar Me Vishwanathan Anand.
Let me start by congratulating you for exams.
I am going to share my experiences about how I am going for my examination.
I am aware that the problems faced by you people are similar to the problems faced by you.
You should rest properly, take a quiet sleep at night, you should eat all your stomach, you must not forget and most important thing is that you should remain calm.
All this is like the left side of the bugyal .
When you are playing, you don't know what kind of thirst is coming forward, you don't even know what questions are going on in the examination.
That is why if you remain calm and you eat all over your stomach , you have feeling sleepy then you will know that your brain remembers the right answer at the right time .
That's why it's quiet.
Do not put too much pressure on yourself , do not keep too much expectations .
Is it important to look at this as a challenge - what I have taught you in the year can I ask this question
Review the most important thing in the last moment, remember what you don't remember, you will probably remember something with the teachers or with the students, and this will help you to remember a lot about it.
If you quench the difficult questions then you will be able to understand that these are new questions for you and when you examine then you can solve them better.
Therefore, be calm, take a good sleep at night, don't be very confident, but don't be disappointed at the same time.
I have always been able to see that these tests are better than you were afraid.
And you must have seen them in the face of international technologies how they settle.
It is difficult to say that it is true but we should make efforts.
You don't talk to your friends, you go alone, you live like a gel, if you wash your book for the last moment then your mind will not be calm.
If the water is calm then it can be seen clearly but if the surface of water gets disturbed then there is nothing below .
At that time it comes to feeling of tension.
Then I feel that if you take some rest then it will be better.
I have automatically developed a system for that.
I breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe openly three or five times.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds, but after this my mind was calm and the mind was prepared to understand the subject.
It is also possible that this experience will be useful for you too.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
Whatever is written on my animal, we should spend at least half the day with our friends and families in happiness.
What do you do
Friends, don't do this.
If you ever go anywhere with your parents, let them come out of your mind, exercise and exam for half an hour.
It is such that Rajat ji should understand the issue.
Friends, will I tell you about Shanti
Today, before you are tested, a person who has sent a message of taxation that is basically a teacher and has become an economist today.
He has been trying to embrace these cultures across the country and around the world by linking this great book of Ramcharit Manas with the present times.
The venerable princess Bapu has said that university is a club.
Friends, I want to tell you one more thing today.
G.
But one thing is certain, be it a student or a gurukilli in the journey of development of the second half of his life.
You must pay attention to this.
I have full faith in it.
My young friends, you have a great deal to go to the examination centre, go to the pothole and sit on your back.
Otherwise there is tension in the mind .
If you understand that information then you will not have the time to repent.
I have also seen that this question paper has changed in the form of a question paper.
Rao has underlined this issue of patience in his message.
Even in the words of Kiman, the beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rao Saheb.
R.
Rao speaks.
I am fully aware that due to exams, it can also be restored by competitive exams.
Do not be careful.
Give me the best, I tell all my young friends.
But at the same time it should be kept in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
Do not leave what you have to do in life and you will succeed.
Don't forget that you are the lakes of this world, you also have the right to live here like trees and mountains.
You need that letter, dedication and dedication.
These qualities will make you successful in examining and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you for whatever you want to do.
Many blessings.
"What is the method of a scientist to tell a question
It takes me half an hour to tell you in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the strength of scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring children across the country.
He spoke of dedication, determination and diligence.
Friends standing firmly
If you stand firmly, fear will also be felt.
And the golden future will wait for you so that you can act with your hands.
Ruchika Dabas has sent a message to me.
And it is true that Sachin ji also said that positive approach, positive condition of mind is created and positive energy is created.
Don't think that inspiring students get inspiration.
In any moment of life, on any aspect of life, the best liberalism, the true event gives us a great inspiration, gives us great strength, and at the time of crisis we can pave the way for a new inspiration.
We are reading the information programme on the subject of Divyangjan Thomas Alva Edison.
Friends, Have you ever thought about how many years he spent on this research
He did not have any special education on the subject of mathematics, but in various fields like mathematical classification and uncertainty, he added.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this power was important for him.
In today's era, this test is not just for students, but for all the families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal has said that the parents should not bear the burden of their expectations.
And seeing this, we are not only driven away, but we are delighted to be able to handle it.
We feel that we too should progress at the pace of science.
This is the reason why today is the National Science Day.
He became the standard of Nobel Prize for this discovery.
And as a reminder, on 28th February, we celebrate this day as National Science Day throughout the country.
The curiosity is the mother of science.
In every mind, every generation has to pay attention to scientific ideas, every person in science, every generation has to pay attention to new research.
Without the participation of science and technology, new discoveries are not possible.
Today, on the occasion of National Science Day, new research should be encouraged across the country.
I am Sir C.
Friends, sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when success comes, our vision of looking at the world changes.
We must have heard that in the last few days science world has found a great and important discovery.
Scientists from all over the world have encouraged, many generations have come, they have worn something or the other.
It was not only this, but also a great research in the field of physiotherapy.
It is a matter of pride that the entire human society will benefit the entire world.
We are particularly proud of the sons of our country and skilled scientists of our country in this entire research process.
Our scientists will make efforts to further this new discovery in the coming days.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, an important decision has been taken in this regard.
The Government has decided to set up LIGO in India to lay the foundation stone for this research.
There are two such centres in the world, the third will remain in India.
Indias participation will give a new energy and new dimension to this process.
India will be actively involved in this great scientific discovery of human welfare with the emphasis on limited resources.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you one name, tip it.
By giving a missed column on this number, you can hear the sound of your mind from tomorrow.
Listen to your mother tongue.
81908-81908. I reiterate that 81908-81908.
Friends, Your exams are starting today.
125 crore countrymen will be examining me.
Just, tomorrow I have been tested that Parva will start yourself.
And when all of us are successful then the country will succeed.
Friends, Many congratulations to you.
Successfully, being free from its stress, moving ahead with a free mind, remaining intact.
I have said two things in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat.
At the same time, we celebrated Christmas and now we have started preparations to welcome the New Year.
India is divided by diversity.
Festivals are a restaurant of festivals .
Sometimes it feels that India is a country based on economies.
Whether it is world-free, terrorism, global temperature rise, natural calamity or human-made, all humankind joy and peace
You know that I am using technology in abundance, and I get a wide range of topics.
I always see this portal MyGov.
People go to different places to celebrate Christmas.
However, it is said that in the tourism sector, special attention is given to cleanliness where there are tourist destinations, religious places, where there are dharamshalas and religious places.
And even though Ganesha Devo Bhav, we say that whenever we reach our homes, we clean the house and decorate the house.
Therefore, we should pay special attention to keeping cleanliness in our tourist places and religious places.
In Bhojpura village in Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh, Dilip Singh Malviya lives in a very old age.
I felt that I had read it and had to reach you.
Dilip Singh Malviya, who lives in the village of Chhotayasya, decided that if a person provides goods for constructing toilets in the village, he will not take up the construction work, he will make the construction of the toilet free of cost.
Assuming that the construction of the toilet is a sacred task, Dilip Singh built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Dilip Singh Malviya.
This country is progressing at a rapid pace due to the hard work of several people.
When every Indian knows that Saray Jan Yog has been attracted towards this thing, and when the entire world celebrated International Day of Yoga and when the entire world was connected, we felt confident that this is our India.
This feeling of confidence is created in your mind only when we see the form of a vibrant form.
The theme of cleanliness is now being discussed in a way.
Their participation will increase.
The biggest benefit of this thing is that the government employees who have been working towards providing electricity to the villages, they have been taking the initiatives to transform the lives of a village, they will be happy to know that whether it is the farmers, the poor, the women or the youth, these things must be provided to them.
If we don't want to get what kind of government has done and what kind of government has not done, then it is their right to get it and they should not be misled.
We must strive to ensure that the right things, good things and the useful things of the common man reach them.
This is a service in a way.
I have made a small effort by my side.
I cannot do this alone, but when I tell you, I should do something or not.
We have to reach out to 125 crore countrymen.
How can I reach without your help
Let us reach them in the language of common man and motivate them to get their rights.
My young friends, on 15th August, in the address of the Red Fort, I had spoken primarily about Start-up India Stand-up India.
After that, the work started in every department of the government.
Can India become the world capital in terms of start-ups
In a new way, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for the youth of our states, be it the manufacturing sector, the services sector or the agriculture sector.
In every case, there is a need for new ideas, new experiments and innovations, the world will not move forward.
Start-up India, Stand-up India scheme is a great opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India will present the entire work of Start-up India Stand-up India.
However, we need to change it as per the requirements of India.
It is expected that a young friend of our country will be able to find a way to reduce the hardships and sufferings of a poor person.
I urge the State Governments to take this initiative.
On 16th January, I will talk to you more vigorously.
I will always welcome your information.
Dear young friends, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda is 12th January.
Like me, crores of people of this country have taken inspiration from Swami Vivekananda.
His Jayanti is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 12 January 1995.
This year, this programme will be held at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
I know that today's vision is India's Youth of Development, Skill and Honey.
He celebrated Excellent India Day, Sulabhsanar Bharat Diwas in his school, and expressed his spirit on the telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet those people working in the society, there are many ideas in the mind.
Now it is true that every word has its own different importance.
I would go to the programme that the Government of India had launched this year's Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, but I had visited some districts of Tamil Nadu, particularly the Mahapura in Chennai and could not attend the programme of Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
But I used to think about that programme.
I felt that in our country we should use this term 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'.
These are the people with whom there are only or more parts that have divinity, the circulation of divine power, which are not like ourselves.
I liked this word very much.
Would the citizens of my country possess the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan that day.
Implementation of the necessary infrastructure directly and indirectly and facilitate ease of access to these disabled people.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations have ramps, accessible parking, accessible transportation, brailleys and many other things.
They liked it.
We should also participate in it on our own.
My dear countrymen, government schemes are going on continuously, but these schemes are not only artificial but also a consciousness.
We have to reach the last stage in a better way.
In the files their breathing should not be dry .
The government of India has made an effort a few days ago to provide the benefits of the scheme to the common man, the poor person and the needy.
Grants are given to LPG cylinders in our country.
This amount is of crores of rupees, but we dont have the system of accounting for the beneficiaries in the right time.
The government has made some changes in it.
With the help of Jan Dhan Bank Accounts and Aadhaar card, the world's largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme has been launched and the amount of subsidy has been deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I would like to proudly tell you that as the world's largest and successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme, this initiative has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
The scheme is known by the name of Pahal.
Nearly 15 crore LPG holders have become beneficiaries till the end of November.
This grant has been directly credited to the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
There is no need for any recommendation, no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, Aadhaar card, opening of Jan Dhan accounts on the other, and on the other hand, the state government and central government have been working together to provide cash to the beneficiaries, link them to Aadhaar numbers and accounts.
A few days ago, MNREGA will provide employment opportunities to the villages.
There were several complaints regarding that.
I am sure that about 35 to 40 schemes are now being included under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment for the Indian Republic Day.
It is the centenary year of Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary.
In the Parliament, a special discussion was held on the Constitution for two days and it was done in a very good manner.
All the parties have spoken very well about the importance of knee implants, the importance of knee implants and the root cause of an accident.
Would it be possible to connect the people with the people with the people on the occasion of Republic Day
We have always talked about the rights given to us by accidents.
It is our sacred duty to donate votes.
What kind of talk about our duties at the time of voting is it not always in life
While celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, what is the need to organize essay competitions, poetry competitions and essay competitions in schools, colleges, villages and societies in cities on 26th January
If 1. 25 billion Indians move ahead with a step by taking a step by duties then a great history can be generated.
I want to know your thoughts.
Send your writings to my portal MyGov.
I want to know what the youth of my country thinks about doing something.
And I don't speak at the government level.
We build the effigies of the great men with great devotion, but we are immensely conspicuous with that of Kamali.
On the other hand, preparations for bathing have also started.
Festivals in society have an automatic importance .
Sometimes this festival puts a fountain on grief and sometimes gives a new dimension.
But sometimes during these festivals, if a crisis arises then it is extremely painful.
Every nook and corner of the world is constantly facing natural calamities.
We have never heard or thought about such natural calamities.
We are now experiencing the rapid impact of climate change.
The way in which there has been heavy and unprecedented rains in our country in the last few days, and the way in which Tamil Nadu has been damaged and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I am indebted to the grievances of all those families in this hour of crisis.
The State Governments work with full strength and help and rescue.
The central government also works with shoulders and shoulders.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that even after this crisis in Tamil Nadu, he will again start moving forward with confidence and the role played by him in the development of the country will be overcome.
But when we look at the crisis around, we need to make several changes in it.
15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the Department of Agriculture as the natural calamities were confined to the same period.
Today the form of this is changing.
At every level, it has become imperative to enhance our capabilities.
For that, the government, the society, the citizens, all the small institutions will have to work from the point of view of science.
After the earthquake of Nepal, I interacted with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif and gave him a suggestion that we should jointly study together to prepare for the disaster.
I am glad that the workshop of SAARC countries was held in Delhi.
There has been a good beginning.
Lakhwindar Singh telephoned me from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
My Lakhwinder Singh is speaking from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We do organic farming here and many people are also guided by this farming.
I have a question of how those people who are burning in the fields or burning the plants of cow dung can not understand how they can guide the micro-organisms of the land and how they will be freed from pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
I am very happy to hear your question.
The first thing is that you are the farmers of organic farming and you are not only doing organic farming yourself but also the problems of the farmers.
Your concern is correct but this is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of people from all over India and in a traditional way we burn the survivors of rice in a similar way.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
The first measure on this is that we should train our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and tell them about the verification of the crops.
But this is not true.
But if we do these ruins on a small scale then it will be a dry fodder for the animals.
Secondly, after burning, the upper level of the earth burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Imagine for a while that your bones should be strong, your heart should be strong, your kidneys should be good, but if the skin of the body is burnt then what will happen
We cannot survive even if the heart is right .
Just as the skin of our body burns then it is difficult for us to stay alive , in the same way the skin of the damp mother burns not only on the skin of the ribs but also on the skin of the damp mother .
If the animals are used as fodder, they are not only able to save their land but if they put the fertilizer in the same land then it will be of double benefit.
The water in those pieces is sufficient for that crop and today their pieces have also been reaped.
They are now getting income from these pieces.
Earlier, the pegs that had to be spent on the cleanliness of the pegs have also become a source of income and the demand for them is increasing.
Dear Countrymen, the next 3rd December will be celebrated as International Disabled Day all over the world.

Physically and mentally retarded persons are also adventurous and capable.
When such individuals are ignored then they are tortured.
Sometimes they are shown blessings.
But if we change our vision of seeing them then we will know that these people can inspire us to live our lives.
You can inspire something.
If there is a small crisis on us, then we keep on running.
Then we realize that the crisis on me is very small.

How do you do things
And that is why all these are inspiring for us.
Their determination is to revert their lifestyle and their difficulty.
Today, I want to tell them that it is 40-42 years old.

The middle class, the junior middle class, the poor, the oppressed, the exploited, the deprived and the deprived sections of the society are constantly linked to the government and the government system.
Even though it is true, lakhs of people of this government do the best of service and dedicated work which is never visible.
In the next year, both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates were jointly awarded Padma Vibhushan.
He does a lot of social work in India.
Whatever he has said in his life and time after his retirement, he is working for the poor.
When he comes to India, he praises those hope workers who have got the opportunity to work with them and tells them how much they are dedicated and suffering.
He tells them how much enthusiasm they have to learn innovation.
A few days ago, the Odisha government had specially honoured an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
And a hopeful worker from this village, Jamuna Manisingh, decided that no one in Tedagaon will die due to malaria.

There will be so many more Jamuna Mani.
Millions of people who are around us.
We can get them with a little respect.
Such people become the biggest strength of our country.
How the happiness of the society becomes a big partner
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all such hope workers through the Jamuna Mani.

My dear countrymen, the entire world is reflected in climate change.
Climate change, awakening of global temperature rise, care is also there and before every work is done, it has been approved as a standard.
The temperature of the earth should not increase further.
This is the responsibility of everyone and it is also careful.
And the first way to avoid temperature is to save energy.
14th December is the National Energy Storage Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.

He has created a committee of women and started a factory of solar power plants and gave it 100 rupees per month.
What kind of help is being provided to entrepreneurs like us
Industry, earnings, empowerment.
However, the speed at which I have to go is a miracle.
But it has been good at the beginning.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that there are 24 lakh women out of 66 lakh women and the following tribes, the other backward classes are those who are self-employed and are trying to run their families with dignity by sacrificing themselves on their feet.
Abhishek has himself spoken of his enthusiasm.
There are several meetings with me too.
Someone told me that someone in Mumbai is a Shailesh Bhosale.
During my Swachhata campaign, I had said that cleanliness campaign is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and it has been done by Shailesh Bhosale.
And I was told that in such a short span of time they have returned two lakh rupees to the bank.
It is working to create potatoes.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor more and more.
Indeed, these people run the economy of the country.
People of small scale industries are the economic power of the country's economy.
We have to give him more strength.
We have to move forward, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.

How should the programme be launched

There can be many such things.
I believe that our information will definitely be useful.
But I would like to urge you to exercise.
In order to make the body healthy certainly use this excellent weather for some time for exercise .
And if it is a season of calamity, then make a habit of charming.
Congratulations to my countrymen once again.
Once again I meet you through Mann Ki Baat.
The fifth one-day cricket between India and South Africa is being played.
This Cricket is called Gandhi-Mandela series.
Both sides have fought each other in two ways, and that is why the importance of the last fight has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I want to convey my best wishes to the friends of Kannur Akashwani.
I want to convey my best wishes that when I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, several students from Kerala also joined the programme Shraddha Thamban.
I want to once again talk about Kerala.
The students of St. Mary Upper Prayeri School of Kochia Chittoor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
Initially, I didn't understand that these kids made me the map of India by the thumbs.
When I read his letter, I realized that he has given a very big symbolic message.
So that the division becomes a trend and a tendency.
I have written a letter to those daughters and asked them to challenge the people about the donations made from their minds.
The 80-year-old Vasrao Sudke Guruji of Maharashtra has continued a movement.

More than 1. 5 lakh people in our country need kidney, heart and liver every year.
But in our country with a population of 125 crore only five thousand transplants i . . part transplant operations take place .
Every year one lakh dollars are required but only 25,000 people get eyes.
When four eyes are needed then we can only move one eye.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some states have done a good job to speed up the efforts of the Hay Partnership by reducing the paperwork.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of the division.
Many social organizations, many NGOs have given a different direction by doing good work.
National Organ and Tishu Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been set up to give importance to Organ Transplant.

India-Africa Forensic Summit will be held in New Delhi from October 26-29, 2019.
For the first time, such a big event will be held in India.
54 African countries and UN leaders have been invited.
The more the population belongs to India, the more the population of Africans.
If both the population unite, one third of the world will be the population.
And it is said that the land of these two countries was united millions of years ago.
Later, due to the Indian Ocean, this part was divided into two parts.
And it is our endeavour to see that people should also come together.
This time, the Government of India has undertaken a major programme of HRD Ministry.
An essay competition was held in the children of the schools where the CBSE has affiliated schools and poetry programmes were organised to enhance their participation.
About 1600 schools participated.
It included schools outside India and India, and thousands of artists had written about the desire to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the Mobile Exhibition from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is going on from Porbandar to Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of artists have seen this performance and people from villages also witnessed this exhibition.
The people knew how great Mahatma Gandhi had played on the relationship between Africa and India, how great the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality was on the two lands.
However, I can see that Indo-Frica is confined but this is the opportunity to connect people.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the honeymoon and the participants, more than 1600 schools and HRD ministry.
I had placed a proposal in the context of Adarsh Gram Yojana on 15th August.
Last month, a workshop was organised in Bhopal in which the heads of the Adarsh Gram are being organised, the artists of that place, the members of that council, the government of India and the state government together discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
In a way, new things have been noticed and some enthusiastic things have been noticed.
He has chosen Parsi Gram Panchayati Adarsh Gram in Kunti Jillah, Jharkhand.
In the Adarsh Gram, a successful effort was made to bring public consciousness along with infrastructure and system in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I congratulate the Hon'ble Member Shriyut Karia Mundanji.
I got a batami from Andhra.
Ashok Gajapati Rajuji Adarsh Gram Yojana, MP from Andhra Pradesh, was very conspicuous in the Adarsh Gram Yojana and elected Dwarupudi Gram Panchayat from Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh as an ideal village.
Nearly 550 elderly illiterates were taught and literate to them.
See, there is no budget in the society, no circular, no special system, but how big changes are brought about due to the will power, it is being seen through the village system.
Our Honorable Parliamentarian Shriyut C.
L. Ruwala, Member of Parliament of Mizoram.
He has chosen Khwala Hillang village as an ideal village, he did a special job.
This village is very famous for production of potatoes and jaggery.
How can the village be made an economic centre, how to market the village production
Ruvalaji, who is trying to build a self-reliant village with Adarsh village, is eligible for congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, is Mann Ki Baat and will it ever happen that there is no talk of cleanliness
I would like to remind you my dear countrymen, after the Diwali, Midia had launched a special mission.
We should also worry about the accidents we don't have before the year.
I would like to congratulate the Middle East for this thing.
On 2nd October, during the Gandhi Jayanti, I got the opportunity to participate in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan through India Today Group.
He had seen the measurements given by Clean India Awards.
How people are doing the work of One Life, One Mission.
How many places have been kept clean in our country
Ever since the launch of the Mission for Cleanliness Campaign, I have seen that the e-Nadus of Andhra Telangana, especially Shriyut Ramuji Rao, are very old but their enthusiasm is not less than the youth.
He has linked 51 lakh children to Andhra and Telangana in about 55-56 schools.
Whether it is a public place or a station or a religious place or a park, a big campaign related to cleanliness has been run in many places.
Now this dream of Swachh Bharat shows the strength to realize this dream.
ABP News launched this programme by the name of Bharat Desh Hai Mera and made people aware about cleanliness and trained the countrymen by ensuring it.
NDTV will be a Swachh Bharat Mission.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Smt. Shanmukh Nathan has written a letter to me and mentioned the village of Mavallayanong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the past few years, this village has taken the initiative of cleanliness.
Almost every generation is dedicated to this cleanliness, it is said that a few years ago he had received the Client Village Award in Asia.
It is important that we all want to believe that our country will be clean and it will be cleaned by the efforts of the people of the country. If we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we can proudly say 100 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had said this on 15th August from the Red Fort, there are some things where corruption has taken place.
And this is why I got the idea of what is the need of the Interview for sixty-six jobs.
I have never heard of it. Is it psychological in the world that can be fully recognized by taking one minute or two
And I had announced that we should shut down the tradition of childhood for these six jobs.
My dear young friends, today I would like to proudly say that the government has completed this entire process and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be posted on the occasion of recruitment.
This rule will be enforced from 1st January 2016 and we will not be able to bring any change in the process of recruitment but it will be implemented from 1st January 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the previous budget.
In our country, gold has become an important part of social life.
It can become a golden power and a golden economic power.
And every Indian must contribute to it.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will pay you interest on it as you deposit your money.
Earlier gold used to be kept in the locker and the locker's rent was also given.
Now keep it in the gold bank and the bank will provide you business.
Now the countrymen cannot have a golden dream
The second thing is that in the Sovereign Gold Bond, this bond is a paper, but the value of that paper is equally gold.
You will get the same amount of money as the price and the price of gold on the day of return.
I am glad to say that we are bringing gold queens.
The Ashok Chakra Gold ueen was about 70 years since independence, but till date we have been using the Farren Gold ueen.
Gold Building Bonds are used abroad.
We are also going to make available to the common man before Dhanteras in the coming weeks, we are launching a golden coin of 5 grams and 10 grams Ashok Chakra.
With this, 20 grams of gold will be available to the people.
I believe that the new scheme will bring about a new transformation in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, an India-Excellency, reminded us that India's honour is emerging.
This great man has contributed a lot in the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
India is full of diversity and diversity. This diversity is our splendor and beauty.
If this is not a diversity then we cannot proudly proudly proudly proud of these beauty.
Therefore, there is a mantra of unity of diversity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the real burden of development.
For the past few years, on 31st October, the programmes of RAN-For-Uniti are being organized in every nook and corner of the country.
The path of unity is also in the true sense of development.
Give tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, now you have started preparations for Diwali and you will be cleaned at home.
You are buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
I convey my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Diwali.
Children get very harmed due to cracks and cracks .
I would like to tell every mother and father that the happiness of Diwali will be lost but do not let the accident happen, the loss of the children of our family will not happen.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I will be visiting Britain.
The Government of India and the State Government provide scholarships to children belonging to these classes of society, tribals and backward classes, who go abroad for study.
I believe that when our children will be taught in Britain then Babasaheb's place will become an inspiration for the country.
You can imagine the joy of the people like me by connecting the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar with the wealth of 1. 25 billion countrymen.
I will get another opportunity in London and I want to unveil the statue of Lord Visveswara.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Visves had done for democracy and for the Employment of Women needs to be studied by the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Visveswara on the land of London is an excellent example of how the great personalities of India thought and visioned many years ago.
My dear countrymen, you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat.
He had spoken to the government officials.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn so many languages
But I am grateful to AIR that at 8 o'clock in the night, every state broadcasts in their regional language.
My dear countrymen once again convey my best wishes.
Jai Hind.
I got the privilege of speaking for the first time on the 3rd of October.
Democracy is of immense importance.
There is a fundamental idea in my life and therefore I am confident of the people's power.
But with the experiences that I learnt from Mann Ki Baat, I can say that the people's power is unconventional.
Our ancestors used to say that Janta Janadan is a part of God.
I can tell you from the experience of mind that there is a great power in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this thing.
I would like to ask the people for information about Mann Ki Baat, just two or four information.
However, in the number of lakhs, people were actively sending information.
This is a great strength.
When people were watching this, they also felt that the feeling of misery and misery about the daughters has to be changed.
There was only one minute revolution.
I told the citizens by putting them in front of tourism in India, Incredible India and incredible India.
People from every part of India sent photographs in the number of lakhs.
The tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government have never seen that we have such a rich legacy.
The government has not spent a single rupee on one platform.
People did all this.
Today, I can say with great joy and satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
I had once said that the poorest of the poor had a dustbin in their houses, the poorest of the poor were rubbing their lives.
Do they not get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society then the government will be able to do more work as a catalyst for social change.
Every small issue has been accepted by us and we have tried to connect ourselves to the nation.
What can be a greater joy than this
I can make a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
We have requested the citizens of the country to reach out to me on your queries, your information and your offer.
In Mann Ki Baat, I will pay attention to it.
I am glad that more than five thousand phones have been received from all over the country, be it Sicily, Kutch, Kamrup or Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is no such state in India from where the citizens have not heard.
This is a pleasant experience.
The citizens of all walks of life enumerated their ideas.
Some of these things have been heard by me automatically. I would like to work hard on the proposals on the rest of the cases.
You might have taken a minute to telecast this telephone, but for me the delivery, ideas and issues are important.
The entire government will definitely work on this.
I am aware of the importance of radio for such blind persons.
I see from a new perspective and many good things he has said are enough to sensitize the government.
I would like to assure the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi that let us appeal to the people of India from this message that we should make maximum use of soil pots in Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to stay with the soldiers for two-three hours.
Navy and Air Force, which protects water, land and sky.
The youth of 1965 with Pakistan completed 50 years.
We have not only heard about the glory of the youth, the moments of pride, the adventure of our soldiers, the sacrifices of our soldiers, but also the system of photography and filming is not available at that time.
Whether it is Hajifir's wish, the real North or the Chamid, the scene of victory at Hajipir Pass keeps thrilling on the organs and the pride of the Indian soldiers comes to the fore.
If you want to show history then you will have to understand the smallest issues.
History keeps our bonds with our children.
If we break the breasts of history then the possibility of history can be completely stopped.
A six-year-old son has given an order to the Prime Minister, but he has forgotten the name of his son himself.
And I can tell you that in the first session of Parliament, cleanliness is being discussed.
There were also comments on our government.
I also had to hear a lot that Modiji was talking about cleanliness but what did he say
I don't feel bad to hear this, but I can see a good thing that there is talk about India's cleanliness in the Parliament of the country.
And on the other hand, it is not possible for the country to participate in this thing.
This movement is going on. Awareness is going on in terms of ideas, unwaveringness and cleanliness.
This will also make the government functional, it will be inevitable to work and work.
In 2019, when we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we should work in that direction to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi from now on.
What are you saying, Mahatma Gandhi
At one place, he said that if there was a time to choose one of the two freedoms and cleanliness then I would give priority to cleanliness. Cleanliness for Gandhiji after independence was more important than independence.
From Delhi, Gulshan Aroda has visited Mygov.
My dear countrymen, we get constant inspiration from the lives of great men.
The evaluation of this great personality is not the work of any idea.
All those who live for the country and those who die for the country will inspire us.
These days will give us the opportunity to remember all these great men.
Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, Jaiprakash Narayanji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October, I would also like to say a lot because this country is a massive Basundara.
You can see any star, no one can get connected with that star in the eyes of history.
I once again request you for 2nd October.
On 2nd October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot do by giving a huge amount of money to the government has been done with your help.
And that is why I once again request you to do this thing.
My dear countrymen, my heart is filled with happiness due to one thing.
Chandra Bose had made all arrangements through the statue of Subhash Babu.
Chandra Bose and his family took up this task and in the last few weeks, there was a lot of congratulation that more than 50 houses of Subhash Babu would come to the Prime Ministers residence.
You can imagine how happy it would be for me.
They will often get the opportunity to visit the Prime Minister's residence, together and together.
But I am delighted to do that because the Prime Minister's residence has never happened before, I will be fortunate to do this in October.
More than 50 brethren of Subhash Babu, family members, some people living in different countries, all these issues will come to the fore.
How enjoyable it is for me
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to awaken the younger generation to register voter, which will increase the participation of the youth in the coming days and will help the younger generation to select and run the government in the future.
I hope that the youngsters who have not yet filed their nominations will register and vote for them.
The 7th student of Kshitij Pandey met me at the Anaras Hindu University, at the Central University, in the seventh century.
Dandaga is confident of her husband.
I would have read a lot that I would like to see the interest of physics at this young age.
The daughter of Sadavpat Patel, who lives in Sundarpur in Varanasi.
He said that if not, if they hand over a book of mathematics, then all the faces and history will be opened in the evening.
I am really very impressed with all our families.
Sometimes such children lose their preference, but I don't know anything about Sonam.
I feel that Devan has given a power.
I got the opportunity to meet two children on my journey to Kashi.
Likewise, the visit of these two children will remain in my mind.
Through Mann Ki Baat, many people are encouraging me to do new things.
Look at this thing, what does Sandeep of Haryana say Sir, Sir, once in a month, do it every week because you get a lot of inspiration from listening to your speeches.
Sandeep ji, what do you do with me
I have to do a lot of hard work from the month to time.
At present, it is stuck once in a month.
Mann Ki Baat in a way completes one year.
You know how much to use Subhash Babu radio
From Germany, he had started his radio centre and he should always inform the citizens of India about the freedom movement from this radio centre.
He had inaugurated the Azad Hind Radio in a weekly visit.
He used to broadcast this radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Mauritius, Punjabi, Parsi Urdu languages.
I too have spent a year talking about AIR.
Your information, thoughts, proposals were sent.
The government also benefits from that.
Improvements started.
Your contribution, your participation is invaluable and invaluable.
Once again, my best wishes to you all.
The citizens of South India have painted on the eve of Onam and celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan yesterday.
The Government of India has launched several new schemes for the common man by taking into account the social security issues.
I am glad that all of you have accepted this scheme in a short span of time.
I had requested our sisters to visit these security schemes on the basis of defence.
I have been told that since the launch of this scheme, 11 crore families have been linked to them. And I have also been told that the benefits of these schemes have been received by the mothers and sisters.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I talk to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana has been taken up in a big way for a year.
Banking sector is also an important part of the economy and this system has also been strengthened to reach the poorest of the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, 1 lakh 31 thousand economic literacy camps were organized to connect the banking sector, economy and poor people.
You cannot stop opening your accounts.
Thousands of citizens are now eligible for overdraft development under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
This is the belief that the poor can get money from the banks.
I once again congratulate all of you and urge all the bankers and the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters to keep their bank accounts unbroken.
This bank is yours. Now don't leave it.
I have brought the bank to you and now it is your job to keep it.
At the same time, due to the recent incidents in Gujarat, the entire country was restless due to violence and it is adventurous that if something happens in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar then the entire country is pushed first.
But in a very short span of time all my swollen brothers and sisters of Gujarat brought the situation under control.
The situation will not worsen and once again Gujarat started moving on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood are the right path and the path of development.
Development is the answer to our problems.
I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi community.
I got the opportunity to listen to their thoughts and tell you something like listening to music.
I came here to speak to the scholars about their selective words, the liberalism of the Sufi tradition, the compassion of music in which there is a rhythm of music.
I feel very happy.
Often, there is a need to reach the world in the form of Islam.
The Sufi community that has been linked to love and compassion, this message will be enjoyed far and wide, and it will be better for the human society, and I also tell others that we should understand the tradition of any community, the Sufi community and the Sufi tradition.
I am fortunate that I will get another opportunity in the coming days and I will get this invitation.
Buddhist scholars from many countries across the globe are coming to Bodh Gaya in India and will discuss global issues about the welfare of humanity.
I am glad that I have got the invitation to visit Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
It is a great pleasure for me that I will have the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya along with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, today I once again want to tell you the issue of my mind.
Even before this, I had decided this topic.
You must have heard from my speech in Parliament, from public meetings, from Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I am telling you that the Government of India has opened its minds in the case of land legislation.
This means that the situation before the formation of my government has now been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to assure you that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a declaration for us.
This mantra is the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August, we had told that not only the Agriculture Department but also the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department will be set up.
We are implementing this decision in a hurry.
The youth of 1965 had completed 50 years two days ago and when the theme of the youth of 1965 emerged, Sahajik was remembered by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
I salute and salute all those who have won India during the 65th anniversary.
These events in history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of Sufi community last week, I got a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to meet Namwant Scientists across the country and interact with them for hours.
I am happy to know that India has been doing excellent work in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing excellent work.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that if this motivation is for me, then it would have taught us something new.
And I have seen how many young scientists used to speak and how many dreams were seen in their eyes.
I had said that students should move towards the field of science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are plenty of opportunities and there are many possibilities.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends would like science and our educational institutions would inspire students for it.
I have written about skill development.
Shriman Prakash from Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu has stressed on the needs of good teachers for primary education.
We have focused on reforms in the education sector.
I would especially like to tell my young friends one thing.
In a speech on 15th August at the Red Fort, I had said that this childhood for low-level jobs, for how this Interview
And when letters come for the child, then every poor family, widowed mother is worried about who will get the recommendation.
No one knows what words are used
This is one of the reasons for corruption at the grassroots level.
I had said in my 15th August speech that even if they don't apply for the selection at the grassroots level, I am glad that in such a short span of time only 15 days have passed.
Information is being sent and the decision will not be implemented for small posts.
It is unfortunate that in our country about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children fall on death due to pregnancy and delivery every year.
This is worrisome and horrific.
There has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and new devotees.
We look at the television but don't pay attention but we don't see it.
It is important to keep small things clean at home with pure water.
Life is extremely valuable.
It is not right to die due to unhealthy depression and hygiene in unhealthy water.
Dengue tests are prohibited at around 514 centers across the country.
This is the period of several festivals in our country.
May every festival be connected with cleanliness. See, the quality of cleanliness will be in your nature.
I always say that we will not be fortunate to offer our countrymen's lives.
Two young people of our country, two brothers, Dr.
Jitendra Mahajan and Dr.
How everybody is trying to take the country forward and this is the thing that everybody is proud to hear.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to lack of understanding.
But my experience is different in terms of youth.
Sometimes we get to know and learn new things by talking to them.
I have met many youngsters who have said that I have taken this initiative on a cycle.
There is a certainty of cycling one day in a week.
He said that being healthy and environment friendly and young is being enjoyed.
Several people have been encouraged to increase the number of cycles used in many households in our country.
I am glad to mention that these are good efforts to save the environment and to keep healthy and today two youngsters of my country have flagged off India in the United States.
Today, I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The memorial will inspire us to work with Dalits, exploited, deprived and deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that have honoured Ambedkar.
The country will be able to move forward by putting the shoulders on the shoulder.
My best wishes to all of you and thank you very much
It will certainly help our farmer brothers and sisters in the field of fertilizer.
One more thing that pleases the mind was remembered and enjoyed.
Our country has always been divided by bitter and oilseeds.
The poor people have to face bitterness, there is little oil for food and vegetables.
I am glad that the cereals that have been manufactured this year have seen an increase of about 50 in the production of cereals and about 33 in oilseeds.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this thing.
My dear countrymen, 26th July has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The farmers have the same relationship with the land of this country.
In the Kargil era, one of our soldiers fell on hundreds of enemies.
The youth of Kargil was not just the youth who fought on the border, every city of India and every village was involved in it.
It was fought for those mothers and sisters who were fighting the enemy in Kargil.
The youngsters who had not yet fought for the war, had seen the youngsters, who had once again fought for such a father who had never learned to walk.
It is because of the sacrifices made by all of them that today India can speak in front of the world.
We started the MyGov campaign on 26th July just a few months after our government came to power in 2014.
In order to connect every citizen with development work, we have started this hint house to increase their participation in democracy.
And today after one year, I am happy to say that nearly two crore citizens have visited this signature of MyGov.
About 5. 5 lakh citizens have filed their responses, and more than 50 thousand citizens have registered information on PMO APPLICATIONS.
Is it right for such people to have difficulty in taking out the train tickets
Well, this thing looks small on the top, but the government didn't even notice it.
However, on the issue of Akhilesh, the government has taken a serious note and today different arrangements have been made for the reservation of tickets for our disabled brides and sisters.
A new logo is created, a to-line is created, a programme policy is being reviewed, a lot of information is received on MyGovy.
There is a feeling of new heritage in the governance system.
There is a feeling of new consciousness.
MyGov information has been started so that I can decide which issue in my speech on August 15th.
From Chennai, Sumitra Raghavcharya has provided a lot of information.
I believe that this is a good idea for the citizens of the country to resolve this issue.
I am sure you will get good information.
I want to take care of one thing and put it to you.
I don't want to preach anybody. I don't want to get rid of the responsibilities of the central government, the state government or local NGOs.
Just two days ago, I saw a scene of accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was about ten minutes and was getting injured.
Hoshakote Akshay of Bengaluru, Amay Joshi of Pune, the happy Kakunje of Murubidari in Karnataka, has expressed his concern over this issue.
One person dies every four minutes in road accident .
But I would like to request the parents that if their children are driven by double standards then they will be able to learn about Charchaki and Safety from their homes and the parents should pay attention to it.
In this regard, the government has taken a number of new policies and initiatives to educate the citizens about road safety, be it road watching systems or be it speedy relief to the affected people.
Keeping in mind all these things, we will consider transport and security legislatures.
Our idea is to take several important steps in the coming days to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety framework.
The scheme is a cashless treatment for roads in Gurgaon, Jaipur, Baroda, from here to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia.
It means that we are giving priority to the treatment of all those affected people who are not able to pay attention at the earliest to get medical assistance in 50 hours after the accident.
To provide information about the accident, 1033 toll free telephone numbers will be available to the patients across the country.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that there will be no accident in the original, because one life and everyone has a greater importance.
Sometimes I tell you that the worker should be employed.
I felt that in the last few days some things have come to my mind and talk to you about it.
But how do we bring laurels in the work done
Biswal has shown how our favourite and artistic capabilities are in harmony with our work.
I got to know about one more thing.
In Madhya Pradesh, a separate campaign started by the Union Government officials of Harda district touched my heart.
I liked the work done by these officers and you will be surprised to know that it is a different matter.
But he gave a new dimension to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
There is a pond named Kaeshwara near Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have constructed toilets in a mission mode.
Now no one in this village is going to open up for toilets and when the work of constructing toilets is completed then we should celebrate a festival.
These are excellent examples of the change in the values of social life, how the mindset of the people changes and how the citizens of the country are leading the country on the path of progress.
From Guwahati, Bhavesh Deka has written about the questions related to the eastern province.
However, the people of the Northeast region are active.
These officers will interact with the officers of the administration of the village and will interact with the representatives and citizens.
The central government will do whatever it is possible to solve these difficulties.
A good effort, an effort to go far eastern from Delhi, is the uick East Policy.
My dear countrymen, the success of Mangal Mission is a matter of pride and joy to all of you.
We know this thing but we don't care about it.
I always tell these officers that the IAS officers of the government should interact with the students of a school and college nearly two-four hours a week.
This work is difficult, but we have to do it.
There is no electricity during the examination therefore do not break in the study of children .
If we want to set up a small business and industry in the village then we will have electricity.
At some places, we have to go to another village to clean the mobile.
We must do this, we have started it.
I felt that today we should talk to you about different topics from Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes to you all.
You must send your information and new imagination for 15th August.
Mann Ki Baat, 2019
I felt that there was a little bit less.
In our human beings, in a very simple environment, in the form of a self-respect among the families of 130 crore countrymen, we used to hear a lot of things.
Sometimes your own things were becoming inspiration for our people.
You can imagine how this honey is spent on vacation.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month - 11 o'clock in the morning.
I used to think every moment that I miss something.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat then I used to say that words might be mine, the voice might be mine, but the story is yours, the meaning is yours, the valour is yours.
I used only my words and my words.
There was a feeling of complete vacancy in the mind.
Once upon a time when elections are over, you should immediately tell us four things.
But afterwards it was not
It is our Sunday programme and it should continue.
However, it was not possible to wait a long time.
Small, simple, simple and small things are also responsible for bringing about a change in the lives of the society.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new energy, a pure Chaitanya and in a sense, we have to move forward by starting this sequence.
Several messages have come in the last few months and innumerable people have been missing Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever I read this message, I feel sorry.
This is my journey from Aham to Wayam.
This Monsoon Dialogue with you for me was a part of my spiritual journey.
Several people have asked a lot of questions about how I visited Kedarnath in the Dhamudi of elections.
You have the right to consider such a question.
And I can understand that you have the curiosity to know the answers to these questions.
I believe that the slightest breakdown given to Mann Ki Baat had created a feeling of gratitude in my mind, perhaps in the valleys of Kedar, in that single cave, I have got the opportunity to fill this box.
Just as many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar's visit, your efforts to strengthen a positive thing and I feel continuity in your speech.
The letters that come for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are available are different from routine, that is, everyday government worker.
Sometimes you sent letters also become the reason for inspiring me in a way.
Sometimes, some of your words tell you the task of shaping my thought process.
People understand me from the challenges faced by the country and the society.
At the same time, people are saying that what is the answer to these problems.
I have seen that people ask for their problems in the letters and what is the answer to them.
Answer to the queries, which new imagination, direct or indirectly reveals.
Mann Ki Baat is like a ritual for the country and society.
Today my heart is filled with joy.
In the last few months, I had said that some people had made a political impression of our meeting with us for three-four months, people said, "Hey, Modi ji has a lot of confidence, he has a lot of confidence.
This confidence was not of some Modis.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
All of you had taken the form of trust.
And that is why I had said in Akher's Mann Ki Baat that now after a few months I would like to talk to you.
And you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this feeling, the order of Mann Ki Baat should be started as before.
The movement was not limited to the architecture.
There was anger in the minds and minds of the people.
Democracy seemed to be a kind of turmoil in the minds of the poor.
When you get food from time to time, you don't know what hunger is.
In the same way, they understand the importance of democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country had a feeling that during the period of introduction, we had lost everything.
Even if someone smiles that we have never used it, it hurts them.
Some arrangements have been made in the event of India and democracy has been created here.
There is also a need for an hour to run a social system.
There is a need for laws, rules and regulations, rights and duties.
But India can proudly proudly say that for us, laws and regulations are the values of democracy that has come upon us.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage, our tradition.
And we have taken this legacy along with a small scale.
Therefore, the country had sacrificed its entire election not for ourselves, but for the protection of democracy.
The most precious democracy that we have got is the home of ourselves.
More than 61 crore people voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
But if the world's hindrance is done then I would like to say that if China leaves then more people than any other country have their right to vote in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States.
More than the population of the entire Europe, there are total number of voters in India.
You can imagine how much resources and manpower are required to achieve this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and staff have been able to cross the election due to their hard work day and night.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have fulfilled their responsibilities for the success of this great mission of democracy.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laid down their lives.
You can imagine the vast scope of the total election.
All the voters had made a flexibility so that they should not be deprived of their votes and that all the eligible voters should be given the right to vote.
In the remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, we had to make a polling station for a woman voter.
You will be happy to know that the officials of the Election Commission had to travel two to two days to reach that far-flung location.
Besides, there is one thing to show pride in this election.
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission and every person involved in this election process and bow down to the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you must have heard from me that if you don't have books then it is my request.
All of us can welcome books instead of flowers.
On hearing this, people have started visiting books at several places.
I recently met Premchand's popular Kahaniaan book.
I liked this meeting very much.
However, I have not been able to get a lot of time but during my journey, I got the opportunity to repeat some of his stories again.
Premchand has made a real picture of the society in his stories and while reading it, the image of that period has to be produced in front of us.
Every penance he wrote, every thing is alive.
Their stories seem to incorporate the feelings of the entire India.
While reading the stories of 'Nasha' he wrote, I myself ran the question of economic inequality in the society.
I remembered my youth.
We used to debate the youth overnight on the economic distress of the society.
The sensitivity of a child, the immense value of his life in his mind, the maturity of his thoughts in such a young age was observed.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his life with a stick from the fair then the human sensitivity reaches a very high altitude, it will make the last reader very emotional.
In this story, a poor farmer's life can be read in a very lively manner.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village situated in the dense forest of Idukki.
Primary teacher P.
P. Murlidharan and one six tea shop running P.
V.
Chinnathambi or both of them started this library with tireless efforts.
In the past, these two books used to be tied to books and books used to be written in their villages in the jungle.
Today this library, along with the tribal children of this place, is working to show a new direction to everyone.
In Gujarat, this mission of 'Gujarat' has been successful.
Millions of people from all walks of life participated in this campaign and read books.
In today's digital era, in the times of Google Guru, I urge you to keep books in your daily routine for a while.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of joy for me that if the people of our country do not only think of the present times but also think of the future challenges.
I was reading your response to Narendra Modi App and MyGov. At that time, many people have written a lot about water problem.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, the success of Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related to water.
The mother of water should be equal to mother and mother should be blessed and the grace of the mother of water should be maintained on her.
Due to the deficiency of water every year in many parts of the country there is misery.
We save only eight percent of the water, so now there is a need to solve this problem.
Just as all of us have solved many other problems with public participation, similarly one hundred and thirty crore Indians will be able to solve the problem of water with the help of everyone, with the help of everyone and with a firm resolve.
Keeping in mind the importance of water is the highest, we are now making a new Jal Shakti Ministry in the country.
This will enable faster decision making on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something at a rapid pace.
I wrote letters to Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans across the country.
In order to save water, to store water, not to drop the rainy season, the village heads should address the gathering to save the rain water.
It has been resolved to save every drop of water in villages and villages and save rain water.
In today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
The people there have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the Prime Ministers and all the Sarpanches for their active efforts to save water.
Several institutions across the country have made such a pledge for water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of that village are now in the process of making water temples in their villages.
I have already said that if we make collective efforts then we get very positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for water conservation across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But all the goals are one and that is water conservation, water conservation.
The work on drainage lines is underway in Punjab.
These works will solve the problem of water conservation.
The life of the people of the village is changing due to the water storage being constructed at Thimpalli in Telangana.
The small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a major change.
I had read about the collective efforts made at Vellore in Tamil Nadu that 20 thousand women gathered here to revive the river Nag.
I am also reading that the work of rainwater harvesting has been done in a very good way in collaboration with the women's hospital in Garhwal.
I believe that when we all are united and striving hard, it becomes impossible.
When everybody is involved in this water conservation, water will be saved at the same time.
Today, through 'Mann Ki Baat', I have the guidance of three things to the countrymen.
My first request is that just as the countrymen have made the Swachhata Mission a movement, similarly, start a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water together and I am confident that water is a prasad given to Parameswaran.
Earlier he used to say that the touches of Paris were made of iron.
I say that water is thirty-four, and the touch of water becomes a new creation.
A awareness campaign should be started to save every drop of water.
We should make the society aware and connect the society.
I urge all of you to share the information about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar, then he would have seen this place.
That is why I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then he must see the collection of water.
Let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and encourage people for water conservation.
You all can share your information using JanshaktiforJalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I want to thank you for one more thing.
The President of many countries across the globe, the Prime Minister, the Hon'ble Prime Minister, the common man, through a Twitter, explained how Yoga Day was celebrated in his own country.
On that day, the whole world was feeling a happy and happy family.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Wouldn't you like to recognise those service providers
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has announced the excellent contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019.
This thing is inspiring.
Now the topic of Yoga is going on, Indians do not lag behind in this field.
Bihar Yoga University, Munger was also honored and dedicated to Yoga for the past few decades.
My dear countrymen, this journey of yours is beginning today, with a new spirit, a new feeling, a new resolve, a new strength, but I will keep waiting for my dreams.
Let us continue to meet, let us keep talking.
I listen to your feelings and keep awake in mind.
Sometimes I try to live that feeling.
Our blessings continue to be such.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again, visit Mann Ki Baat next month.
My best wishes to you all
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
After the bravery of the brave soldiers in the terror attack in Pulwama, there has been a stir in the minds of the people of the country and there has been a strong sense of hatred in the minds of the people.
They are very much concerned about the martyred brave soldiers and their families.
The feeling of intense hatred against such violent violence is in our hearts and in my mind, the same feeling is in the minds of every citizen of the country and the humanity of the entire world.
I salute all the brave sons of this country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always shown unparalleled courage and valour.
Where they have shown unprecedented potential for peace.
He has worked to give the attackers a simple answer in their own language.
We must have seen how it was done within a hundred hours.
Ram Niranjan ji, the father of Shahid Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, is also inspiring all of us in such a sad event.
He said that if we send our second son to fight against the enemy then we will fight ourselves if we need it.
The nation is saluting the indomitable courage of Meenaji, the wife of Shaheed Ananda Sahu of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has also decided to recruit a single child in CRPF.
When this village of Gumla in Jharkhand, when the martyr Vijay Shoren, who was wrapped in the Tricolor, then his innocent son said that you will also be filled with fire.
This is the feeling of every small child in India today.
Such a feeling is visible from the houses of our brave martyrs.
There is no exception to our brave martyrs that their family is not an exception.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's Hutma Vijay Maurya or the mother-father of Kangra's martyr Tilakraj or the six-year-old son of Shahid Hemraj of Kotta, the story of every family of the martyrs is inspiring.
We will not need to look at the old events in history to know what is wrong.
These are examples in front of our eyes.
These examples are the source of inspiration for the bright future of India.
My dear countrymen, we have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for the last several years.
It is natural for the countrymen to have curiosity and curiosity in their minds.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Yut Onkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka, expressed happiness that the National War Memorial has been completed and completed.
It is a memorial that will commemorate the great valour of our brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to build such an inspirational monument in the country.
We have decided to set up a National Military Memorial and direct work has also been started.
Yesterday, on 25th February, this National Military Memorial, we will supply crores of people to our army.
The country will do its best to repay the loans on us.
This new monument has been built near that place called the heart of Delhi, India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I am sure that this holy task of visiting a pilgrimage will be the vision of the countrymen.
This is the National Military Memorial, the symbol of the country's gratitude for the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives after Independence.
The construction of this memorial will showcase the indomitable adventure of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of this National Military Memorial is based on four central cycles, from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom.
Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyred soldier.
After this, the protective cycle is reflecting security.
There are rows of dense trees in this cycle.
These trees are symbols of soldiers and are also giving a message of trust to the citizens of the country, every corner is resting on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Someone will come here to know about the bravery of these brave soldiers and at that time they will be safe in the country and we will be able to get the information of these soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for the country.
Our Armed Forces, Police and Armed Forces are not really possible in terms of great and invaluable contributions in the development of the country.
I believe that all of us should be grateful to the men and women police personnel who are continuously working for our security.
I hope that all of you will definitely visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
It will also inspire others to visit this holy place and it will also be an excitement to visit this holy place.
This time when I was reading the response from you, I was convinced that I had a very strong response from Ankish Mukhopadhyay Ji.
He wrote that on 3rd March, 1900, the British had attacked Birsa Munda.
And Yoga is the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on 3rd March.
Both of them have come from different family backgrounds, but both of them have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In Mann Ki Baat, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata, in a way, the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand can be bowed down.
These two great personalities have brightened not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youngsters get inspired as guides then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
When Birsa Munda was lying down, the British wrapped him up and hid him.
Do you know that the British had to accept the path of such suppression to catch Munda
The reason was that the British Munda, who built such a large empire, was afraid.
Lord Birsa Munda had completely destroyed the British government with the help of our traditional wealth.
In fact, if people get such an inspirational leadership then they become stronger than the forces of the armed forces around the enemy.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
He did everything in his life.
The dark life of the deprived and exploited brought light like sun rays.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed the 25th year of his age.
The sons of Mother India like Birsa Munda have taken place in every part of the country.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice of these great people have not reached the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda has made us aware of the existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata has created a large institution in the country.
For a bright future, India must become the hub of science, technology and industry.
Not only this, he established several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekanand ji had once met in the ship during the visit of the United States and discussed various topics.
The Indian Institute of Science founded its foundation stone in this discussion.
My dear countrymen, the mother of our country Prime Minister Morarjibhai Desai was born on 29 February.
You all are aware that this line will come once in four years.
Simple, quiet personality, Morarjibhai was one of the most educated leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is the record of presenting the most economies of Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India during the difficult period when the country's democracy was in crisis.
Morarjibhai Desai shook himself in the movement against imperialism for the protection of democracy.
He had to pay a huge price in his old age.
At that time the government had put them in a hurry.
He became the Prime Minister of the country when he was elected by the Janata Party in 1977.
Accordingly, the fundamental rights obtained under Article 20 and 21 of the Act shall not be violated even during the period of implementation.
Morarji Bhai had reconstructed this incident to ensure that there should never be any repetition of the manner in which democracy was slaughtered in 1975.
Once again, I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, every year there was a lot of enthusiasm among the people about the Padma awards.
In such a situation, we feel that those people who work with honesty, pride and respect for their work should be done.
Many people have been making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways by taking utmost hard work.
The people who have been working in the service of the people, the service of the society and the service of the nation, are selflessly employed.
These are the actual activity and are far from the world of fame.
He believes in work, Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam, this message of singing is in a way a direct world.
Today, I want to talk to you about some such people.
Friends, these rare paintings are working to reach the new generation.
This artefact, made by Abdul Gafoor, was presented by me to Maji President Barack Obama, USA.
Among the standards of Padma awards the Shabbir Said of Maratha is known as the servant of Gomati .
The way he has dedicated his entire life to the service of cow slaughter, his work is clearly visible.
Even after the age of centuries, many people from all over the world are training Yoga.
Until now, he has made 1. 5 thousand people Yogakshakas, and Jamuna Tudu, famously known as Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has taken two hands with the Timber mafia and the Nakshalwads, not only this, but 50 hectares of the area will save the forest from erosion.
Due to the hard work of Jamuna Baiji, now the villagers in that area have planted 18 trees after the birth of every child in their house.
He has worked towards women empowerment and how farming can benefit.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women in our region to join the Self Help Groups to become economically self-reliant.
This change in the list of award winners means a new idol of India that is transforming in a way.
My dear countrymen, the experience of a heart attack has come to me recently and I will tell you here today.
I am trying to get the opportunity to talk to some beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I understand that this scheme is bringing about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If a poor person cannot afford to afford medicines then you must give him information about this scheme.
This scheme is for the poor.
My dear countrymen, the climate of exams will start in schools.
These 10th and 12th exams will be started in the next few weeks in taking the vows of different exam boards across the country.
My best wishes to the parents and teachers of all these students on exams.
A few days ago, a very big programme like 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' was organised in Delhi and the Town Hall was like a programme.
Pariksha Pe Charcha, a special feature of the programme, was a very interesting interaction on various topics related to the examination.
This will certainly benefit the students.
All students, their teachers and parents can see the entire recording of this programme on YouTube and my best wishes to all the examiners for the upcoming exam.
My dear countrymen, there is talk of India and we cannot talk about festivals.
This is because we have a tradition of thousands of years old culture.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and had got the opportunity to spend some time with the disabled brothers and sisters of Kashi.
It was a pleasant surprise to hear the copy of it for me.
The way I speak in Mann Ki Baat, the differently abled youngsters speak in the same way.
It means that people only listen to Mann Ki Baat and leave it alone
I was really impressed by the power of that disabled young man.
My dear countrymen, it is a wonderful experience for me to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through Radio, I interact with crores of families every month.
Many times, while talking to all of you, reading the letters sent or listening to the phone, I feel that we all consider me as a member of our family.
This is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Election is one of the biggest festivals of democracy.
In the next two months, all of us will be in the threshold of elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election.
Mann Ki Baat will be the last Sunday of the month of May by respecting the strong democratic tradition.
This means that the month of March, April and the entire month of May will go for three months.
After the election of all our emotions in this period, with a new belief and with the strength of blessings of all of us, once again, we are launching a programme to interact with us through Mann Ki Baat and for many years we will continue to do Mann Ki Baat.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveswara has taught us - 'Kaikave Kailas' means keeping our responsibility hard, that is, the residence of Lord Shivaji is like staying in Kailashdham.
His fame was a scholar who had a unique image of English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He used to lead his entire life to provide food, comfort, education and spiritual knowledge.
I have often been fortunate to receive the blessings of respected Swamiji.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem for revered Swamiji this time.
This poem by Dr Kalam Saheb, Your Receivable Happiness All Meeting Will Blace, All Your Actions presents the life of Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Monastery beautifully.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
On 25th January, the Election Commission was formed, which is celebrated as the National Voters Day, the vast level of elections held in India, the people of the world are surprised to see that the Electoral Commission administered the skills that each country has a pride in the Election Commission.
Every citizen of India who is a registered voter in our country.
No one leaves any stone unturned to ensure that there is a registered voter and he gets an opportunity to vote.
In Himachal Pradesh, we also hear that the polling stations are being set up at a height of 15,000 feet from sea level, while arrangements are made for voting on extremely remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Just imagine for a voter.
When we hear these things then it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
This is the beauty of our democracy, so that the employees of the Election Commission go to the far-flung areas to ensure that they get the opportunity to use their votes keeping in mind that voter.
I appreciate the Election Commission which is constantly trying to strengthen our democracy.
I would urge the young generation to register as voters if they are eligible to vote.
At the same time, it is my duty to donate votes.
We must feel this responsibility.
This should be our attitude, our tendency, our tendency.
This should be our culture.
I urge the brave people of the country to collectively register voter registrations or to make people aware about the voter turnout.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will be registered as voters and they will further strengthen their democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some unforgettable and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is multi-purpose.
One of the greatest personalities was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On the occasion of Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who had contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You are aware that several rooms and buildings were closed in the Red Fort since independence.
Museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army has now become a very beautiful museum in the Red Fort.
The museum dedicated to India's First War of India and the entire complex as Kranti Mandir has been dedicated to the nation.
There is a smell of our glorious history in every market in this museum.
The museum inspires us to see the legends of the heroes of our freedom struggle in history.
At this very place, the British royalty was run by Bharat Mata's brave son-Carnal Prem Sahgal, Karnal Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was seeing the memories associated with Netaji in the Red Fort, Kranti Mandir, then the members of Netaji's family gave me a very special, cap cap cap.
Netaji used to guide that cap.
I have given them a copy of the museum so that the people coming here can see that cap and take inspiration from it.
In fact, our heroes need to constantly transform different forms of valour and patriotism into a new generation.
A month ago, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30 December.
In a programme, the tricolor was thrown at the same place where Netaji Subhas Bose had thrown the Tricolor 75 years ago.
This is the reason that when the Tricolor broke out in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone would be surprised because there is a tradition of 15th August.
On this occasion, the formation of the Azad Hind Government had completed 75 years.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled consortium.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji gave me a lot of temptations like 'Delhi Chalo' and 'I am blessed with you' and made a place in the hearts of every Indian.
And I am glad that we have been able to do this thing.
I remember that day when all the families of Netaji had come to the Prime Ministers residence.
All of us together conveyed our condolences on many issues related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhash Bose.
I am glad that several places related to the great heroes of India have been developed in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir, related to Babasaheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that is Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered connectivity with Radio people as an important medium, similarly Netaji had a great deal with Radio and he also chose Radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu started Azad Hind Radio and used to interact with the soldiers and people of Azad Hind Fauj through radio.
There was a different style of starting the address on the radio of Subhash Babu.
At the outset, he used to say - "Is Subhash Chandra Bose Speaking to You over the Azad Hind Radio".
I was told that these radio stations used to broadcast weekly messages in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Mauritius, Punjabi, West and Urdu.
This radio station is being run by M.
He played a very important role.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programme gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been set up in this revolutionary temple.
An attempt has been made to showcase Indian art and culture in a very attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works of centuries old.
The excellent sculptures of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy and Saloj Mukherjee have been exhibited in the museum.
And I specially urge all of you to go and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that there is talk of art here and I am telling you about the excellent architecture of Gurudev Tagore.
Till now, we have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on many topics.
He has also taken out pictures of animals and birds, he has taken out many beautiful pictures of nature, and not only this, he has also worked on several human characters in Canada through art.
And the special thing is that he has not given any name to most of his pictures.
He was confident that his painting would understand the meaning of his own painting, and the meaning of his message from the paintings would be known from his perspective.
Their paintings are being exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope that we will definitely see their paintings in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of Saints.
Our Saints have given a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Sant Ravidas ji used to give a big message in a short span.
He had said that whenever a person does not go to the tribe of Haijo Ketan, he does not get the root of banana, the leaves below the leaves, the leaves below the leaves and the last few are not available, but the entire tree comes to an end, just like that man has lost a variety of castes and humans have not lived.
He used to say that if God indeed belongs to every human being, then it will not be right for him to go on a path and other social basis.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life through his messages.
It will not be wrong to mention here that he explained to the world the true meaning of labour.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I should highlight the space programme of India and the aspects related to its future.
I would like to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think of going beyond the sky, he added.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad when I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has been an important contributor to Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching the space.
On 24th January, the Kalam-Set launched by our students.
Several records have been set up by the students of the university in Odisha.
The number of space missions that have taken place since independence till 2014, almost the same space missions have started in the last four years.
We have also made a global record of releasing 104 satellites from the same spacecraft.
We will soon showcase India's presence on the Moon through Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technology to protect livelihood and goods.
Whether it is cyclone or rail or road safety, space technology is helping in a better way.
Our fishermen brothers and sisters have been given navy devices, which are also helpful in economic upliftment along with their security.
We are using space technologies to enhance public service delivery and accountability.
The Housing for All (Housing for All) is home to almost 40 lakh households in 23 states.
At the same time, the geo-tagged goods worth approximately 1. 5 crore have been lost under the MNREGA.
Our satellites have become a symbol of the growing power of the country today.
Our excellent relations with many countries of the world are the same contribution.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also given development to our neighbouring friendly countries.
Through our Asim Competitive Launch Service, India today launches satellites not only for developing countries but also for developing countries.
The sky and stars are always big attractions for children.
Our space programme gives the children the opportunity to move ahead with the limits that they had to face till now.
Our vision is to keep our children busy and inspire them to find new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that those who play games will open and many youngsters and young sportspersons have come forward in India.
In January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in the Khelo India Youth Sports Competition in Pune.
When sportspersons perform the best at the local level, they will perform the best at the global level.
This time in Khelo India, sportspersons from every state have performed well at their respective levels.
Many sportspersons who have won medals will give a strong inspiration.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Under the 21st anniversary of Maharashtra, the captain of the Women's Custody Federation, Sonali, is supposed to be an accomplishment. A very small girl went to her house and encouraged her brother and her mother Sonali's skill.
It is often seen that there is no encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
However, Sonalin chose the tributary and performed excellently.
The 10 year old Abhinav Shaw of Asansol is the youngest gold medal winner of Khelo India Youth Sports Competition.
Akshaya Baswani, son of a farmer from Karnataka, won a gold medal at Kamati Hind Weightlifting.
His wife is a farmer in Belgaum.
When we talk of building India then the resolve of youth power is a New India.
The stories of Khelo India are not only contributing to the creation of a New India but also contributing to small towns, villages, youth, young sports talents.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about several prestigious details contests.
The name of this arson competition is Clean beautiful toilet.
People are cleaning their toilets and making their paintings and making them beautiful, we will also get to see the pictures of clean toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all Sarpanchs and village heads to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
Definitely put pictures of your clean beautiful toilets on Mylzzatghar and social media.
Friends, On 2nd October, 2014, we have started a journey together to keep the country free from clean and open defecation.
Today, India is looking forward to getting rid of open defecation very long before October 2, 2019, so that I can pay my homage to the fathers on their 150th birth anniversary.
The residents of Himachal Pradesh, Ankul Sharma, have written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exams.
Andal ji, thank you for presenting this issue.
For many fairs, the first part of the year is the seat of exams.
Students, from their parents to teachers, all are engaged in the work related to exams.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
Today, I would certainly like to talk about this programme of Mann Ki Baat, but you will be happy to know that after two days on 29th January, at 11 a.m., I will interact with students from all over the country, including students, parents and teachers will also participate in this programme.
And this time students from abroad will also participate in this programme.
I will certainly put forward some of these ideas and information in the Town Hall programme.
You can also see the same live broadcast through social media and NamoP.
My dear countrymen, 30 January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire country pays homage to the martyrs.
You should also pay homage to martyrs for two minutes.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
The year 2018 will end.
And then it benefits the experiences, and there is also confidence in choosing.
What can we do, which will transform our lives, together with the contributions made by the society and the country.
My best wishes to you all in 2019.
All of you will have to decide with any memories of 2018.
It is also important to note how India will be the strength of one hundred and thirty crore people in 2018 as a country.
And it is also a matter of pride for all of us.
In 2018, Ayushman Bharat, the worlds largest health insurance scheme, was launched.
Vegetables have reached every corner of the country.
The world's prestigious institutions recognized that India is working on poverty alleviation at a record pace.
With the unwavering resolve of the countrymen, the scope of cleanliness is moving forward from 95 to 95.
For the first time since independence, the Tricolor was thrown at the Red Fort on the 75th day of the Azad Hind Government.
The Statue of Unity has received the highest statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who has brought the country to the forefront of unity.
The name of the country has been raised in the world.
The highest environmental award of the United Nations Champion of the Earth was conferred on the nation.
India's efforts to change the solar energy and environment will get a place in the world.
The first meeting of the 'Jagtik Solar Alliance' was held in India.
Our collective efforts have led to an unprecedented increase in the ease of doing business in India.
The defence of the country has become stronger.
This year our country has successfully completed the inclusive triangle, that is, we are now embroiled in the three regions of the Armed Forces, Navy and Air Force.
The country's daughters travelled around the world through ocean surveillance and the ferry of the country was filled with pride.
Indias first climate has started in Varanasi.
This has led to a revolution in the waterways sector.
The first and 100th Pakyong airport in Sikkim was inaugurated.
India also won the 19-year-old Cricket World Cricket World Christian.
This year, India earned a large number of medals in the Asian Sports Competition.
India also performed well in the Para Asian competition.
If I keep talking about our collective endeavours for every Indian, then my Mann Ki Baat will be so long that 2019 will emerge.
This is possible only through the tireless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we have met a few exceptional Indians in this December.
On December 19, 19th, Dr. Janandran received the same fund.
Dr. Janendran is known as the cheapest treatment for the poor.
People say that they used to be on course for the patient's service.
I have read a number of articles about this kind of work that inspires his society.
Similarly, Sulagitinaras Mama of Karnataka was funded on 25th December.
Earlier this year, he was honored by Padma Shri.
There are many people like Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narasamy who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of the society.
While we are talking about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts of the doctors of Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city organised camps and provided free treatment to the poor.
Its heart long crystal care is taken every month in such camps where free treatment is possible for many types of diseases .
Today hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps every month .
The zeal of these young doctors , who are serving the patient in a quiet manner, is really remarkable.
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been successful due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people in Madhya Pradesh took a pledge of cleanliness.
I'm still Tibeterindia.
I am sure that this will bring more and more people to know about our brothers and sisters who bring about change in the society.
It is easy to spread negativeness .
However, many good things are happening around us in the society.
And all this is happening with the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important part of every society.
When sports are played then energy is created in the minds of those who watch it.
We see a lot of things like fame, identity and honor of sportspersons.
But sometimes there are many things that are more than the world's sports.
I would like to tell you about the loss of lives in Kashmir and he won a gold medal in the Karate Excellence in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives here in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hanaya studied and performed karate by Mehnat and Chikati, learned and proved himself.
I pray to all the countrymen for their bright future.
Many best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussion among the media about the 16-year-old Rajani daughter.
Rajini said that his parents have done a lot of hard work to reach here.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning before Rajni and his passions were raised.
When Rajini expressed his desire to learn against evil, he collected all the possible resources and enhanced his enthusiasm.
Old gloves had to be used to fulfil Rajni's fate because the financial condition of his family was in vain.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni was not able to get rid of it.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I extend my best wishes and blessings to Rajni and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singhji and Usha Rani for helping Rajni and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old Kanya of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni has become one of the fastest Asian migrants in the world.
It used to run around 300 km cycle daily for 159 days.
You can imagine that 300 km cycling everyday
Their stubbornness of cycling is truly arbitrary.
Whether we are inspired by such successes and achievements
Especially when my young friends hear about the incidents, they also get inspired to do something by crossing the barriers.
If there is a determination, if there is a power in the resolution then all the problems come down automatically.
No problem can be hindered.
When we hear about such examples, we also get an inspiration from every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, many festivals like Irodi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi will be celebrated in January.
On the auspicious occasion of these festivals, whenever there is a color of traditional dances in the country of Sanoran, iron will be burnt in the joy of Sugi.
After this the day begins to grow gradually and the winter season begins .
Many congratulations to our food-grained farmers.
Ekta in our eternal diversity - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is one of our emotions.
We can see how united our festivals have been with nature.
Societies and nature are not different in Indian culture, but individuals and communities are the same.
Excellent example of our close relations with Nature is the calendar based on atoms.
This is not only the year but also the information of the planets and constellations.
This traditional calendar tells us how old our relationship is with natural and astronomical events.
According to the speed of the moon and the sun the thirst of the moon and the sun is fixed according to the calendar .
It depends on the calendar that calendar calculates.
Celebrations are also celebrated in many areas as per the status of constellations.
All these moon calendars are celebrated in accordance with the moon calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishakha, Vaisakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu - all these festivals are celebrated in accordance with the sun calendar.
River and water conservation have special significance in many of our years.
Chhath is a symbol of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds.
Millions of people also take bath in the holy rivers in Makar Sankranti .
Our festival also teaches us social values.
On one hand, it has an ancient importance, on the other hand, every corner is easily inspired by social brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to all of you in 2019 and wish you a lot of joy in the future.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture that we can take pride in and proudly demonstrate to the world.
People from all over the country come here and keep connecting with Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, the people's ocean of faith and faith is looted.
Millions of people from all over the country come together at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is embodied and blossomed in our great cultural heritage.
The world famous Kumbh Mela is being organised in Prayagraj from January 15 this year, perhaps you all are eagerly waiting for it.
Prayagraj has started reaching Santa-Mahatma since now for Kumbh Mela .
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the midst of the unique cultural traditions of humanity, so that we can imagine its global importance.
A few days ago, the princes of several countries had come to see the preparations for the Kumbh.
At that time, the nation's flag was thrown at once.
The Kumbh Mela, being held in Prayagraj, is likely to have people from more than 150 countries.
With the divine divinity of the Kumbh, India's grandeur will reflect its diversity throughout the world.
The Kumbh Mela is an effective medium for its discovery and every person coming here feels differently.
This is a great academic experience especially for youngsters.
I went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are in full swing.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh Mela.
This year, emphasis is being laid on cleanliness in Kumbh.
If we look at cleanliness along with cleanliness in the Kumbh, then its good message will reach far and wide.
This year, after the holy bath at the Bhavik Triveni Sangam, Akshayvat can also be worshipped.
This akshayavat symbolized by the faith of the devotees had been closed in a fort for many years, so that even if there was a desire, it was not possible to see the future.
But now the doors of this akshayavat have been opened for all.
I would like to urge you to upload some photos of the Kumbh Mela on social media when you visit Kumbh.
This Kumbh of spirituality should become a great philosophy of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh of Artificial Intelligence should also be the Mahakumbh of creative forces.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of fervor in the minds of all our countrymen on the occasion of 26th January Ganesh Diwas.
There is an unbreakable link between venerable Bapu and South Africa.
From South Africa, 'Mohan' has become 'Mahatma'.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood firm against discrimination.
He also established Finnics and Tolstoy Farms, thereby raising voice for peace and justice all over the world.
This year 2018, Nelson Mandela is also being celebrated as a Jan Shatabdi Year and is also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela is considered an ideal in the fight against discrimination in the entire world.
He had got the courage and inspiration from Bapu for so many years.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Bapu and Mandela are not just inspirational for the entire world, but their ideals encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP summit was held at Narmada in Gujarat, where the world's highest statue is the Statue of Unity.
A comprehensive discussion was made on how steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
At the same time, I announced the launch of the Sardar Patel Award for National Unity and in any way, the award will be given to those who contribute to national unity.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He was always trying to keep India's integrity uninterrupted.
Sardar Patel believed that India's real strength was united in the diversity here.
We are paying homage to him through this award of unity, respecting his spirit.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is a sacred day of the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna. He had spent a lot of time in his life in North India and he had sacrificed his life in Nanded Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and life in Nanded.
Thus, in a sense, the whole of India received his blessings.
If we look at their lives then we get to see a reflection of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji won the post of Guru in the last nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice as a legacy from Guru.
His personality was calm and straightforward, but whenever an attempt was made to smile the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh fought hard for the poor and the weak and that is why it is said.
He used to say that it is not right to demonstrate our strength by fighting against the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji believed that it is the biggest service to remove the grievances of human beings.
He was an excellent tricolor and he was a symbol of many other languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Farsi, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again bow to Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country which are not discussed at large.
I mean, Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority is maintaining.
The work is underway to promote safe and healthy habits of diet.
India can be prosperous only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritious food is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, the F.S.
I convey my heartiest congratulations on this initiative taken by him.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this programme.
I would like to tell you that you should also participate in it and especially the children should show this thing.
It is important to get education from childhood which gives importance to diet .
My dear countrymen, this is the last ever programme in 2018 and once again in 2019.
Whether it is a person or a nation or a society, the motivation is the foundation of the progress of that life.
Let us move forward with this new inspiration, new zeal, new resolve, new perspective and new heights, change ourselves and change the country too.
On 3rd October, 2014, through Mann Ki Baat on the sacred pilgrimage of Vijayadashmi, all of us had started a journey together.
One person was a shield.
There is no clothing on the dhabas.
He had constructed a tapari-like frame on the road.
At that time there was talk of it on radio.
In the remotest part of the country, from the villages to the metro cities, from the farmers' bonds to the youth, it should reach all of us.
Recently, AIR has conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of the facts that have been received from that survey are very different and careful.
Out of those surveyed, 70 of them are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people seem to have contributed a lot to the Mann Ki Baat in increasing the positive spirit in society.
This is a glimpse of the positive sentiment in the minds of our countrymen.
Many people have also shared their experiences that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of Voluntaryism and voluntary movement.
People are coming forward with a lot of enthusiasm for social service.
I am very happy to see that Mann Ki Baat is increasing the popularity of radio.
But in this journey only radio has not remained the same medium.
Thank you very much for calling on phone call
The doubts that we have raised are absolutely correct.
However, if a leader was given a mic and millions of people used to listen to him then what else would he do
He studied what words were used repeatedly.
The students have concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I started the Mann Ki Baat programme, at the same time I had decided that I should not go to politics.
My resolution was inspired by you and I was inspired by you.
It is evident that in the letters before every part of Mann Ki Baat, online tips, what are the expectations of the labourers from the phone calls.
What Modi will come and go, but this country will remain intact, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore countrymen will continue to live.
Someone writes letters from a distant place in the country and tells me that people like us, those who run auto rickshaws, those who sell vegetables should not be overwhelming.
Now, a small village in the state of Haryana like selfie with a dotor can be started not only in the country but also in the country.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government.
Mann Ki Baat is a matter of great ambitiousness.
If we have to answer the question directly in a simple word then we will say that nothing will be prepared.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy job for me.
Because every time I get letters from people before Mann Ki Baat.
People also record their messages in their voices by combining this number.
Before every part of Mann Ki Baat, we are trying to make more letters and tips ourselves.
Every moment my countrymen have made a house in my heart. And that is why when I read a letter, the situation of that journalist, his feelings and feelings become a part of my thoughts.
In such a situation, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
But for all instances, spirit and motivation belong to my countrymen.
In Mann Ki Baat, there are lakhs of people who have not been able to call me.
Efforts are also made to ensure that all the letters and related departments who cannot get a place in Mann Ki Baat.
It is because of their hard work that Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
A team of AIR prepares every part to broadcast in different languages.
Some people hear Mann Ki Baat in the vernacular languages spoken in Shali.
In a way, they become Narendra Modi for those 30 minutes.
I congratulate them and thank them for their hospitality and their skills.
I urge all of you to listen to this programme in your local language.
However, many of the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat have also been taken up by media.
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Amli Materials Free India, Selfie with Daughter, the media created a new concept and made it a campaign and worked a lot in that field.
Without our cooperation, the journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete.
Sometimes even our predecessors continue to face a great crisis in communication.
Besides acceptance and response, I am giving priority to understanding what the people of the front have to say.
Normally, there was always talk about the 'Communication Gap' between a large family, elderly and Kumar Vayotali Mulan.
In reality, in most of the households, the topic of talking to children and children is also limited.
In this, there was talk of studying children or their habits for a long time.
I am always trying to learn from them what they are doing or how they think about it.
This is the New India.
Some people say that the young generation has a desire to do many things at the same time.
I say - what is wrong with this
These youngsters have shown the philosophy of asking questions and dreaming of a big dream.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gururgram has written on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i. e.
They say that this day is very special because we have accepted the Constitution because it is now 69 years old and we are going to enter the 70th year.
Just imagine, within three years, these great personalities created such a comprehensive and comprehensive event.
This is the best example of the systematic management and productivity of these great people.
There is a special feature in our jurisdiction that rights and duties have been described extensively about rituals and duties.
In the lives of citizens, both of them are going to take the country forward.
If we respect and respect the rights of others then the protection of our rights will be on our own. And if we follow our duties in the jurisdiction then the protection of our rights will be on our own.
I still remember that in 2010, when India's democracy was 60 years old, we had taken a commemorative tour of Gujarat by holding an elephant on the elephant.
We have made efforts to create awareness about the ruins of the youth and to connect them with the ruins of the state.
And make sure that Peace, Progress, Prosperity, Peace and Prosperity Nandel are in our country.
My dear countrymen, we can never forget the contribution of the great personality that was discussed in the Rajya Sabha.
He was a great man, revered Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana day.
What is the democracy and what is the parliamentary system, this is not a new thing for India.
He had said that this freedom that we have achieved after such a struggle is invaluable and we have to protect it from the drops of our blood.
India First Ha Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv next year in 2019.
Guru Nanak Devji always considered the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have also been instructed to celebrate this event in a big way.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in all the countries around the world.
At that time, I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara suffered a major loss.
But the way the state government has worked with the help of local people, it will still be an ideal.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit that holy place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
But this journey of ours will continue.
The more people will be connected with us, the better our journey and the better will be the happiness of everyone.
Sometimes the question arises in the minds of people, what do I get from Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the lad of all of us, has been decorated every year for the youth of the country to listen to the "Run for Unity".
I urge all of you to participate in this race to listen in large numbers.
Six months before independence, on 27 January 1947, the world's famous International Monthly Time was published on the face of Sardar Patel.
This was the map of India which was divided into several parts.
Then more than 550 institutions were in the country.
Even if the British had finished their juice in India, they were trying to break the country into several parts and then leave the country.
The Times had written that the dangers of conflict, violence, primarily stagnation, inflation and the politics of freedom are enormous.
The Times further wrote that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will have the ability to supplement the country with the ability to supplement its wounds.
This trend of TIME was to open several other pillars of the life of Iron Man.
How did he arrange for rescue operations in Ahmedabad in the decade of 1920, how he gave direction to Bardoli Satyagraha
He brought all institutions to merger in India.
Whether it is Junagarh or Haidarabad or Travancore, we can see a common India today because of the ideological maturity and strategic skills of Rajvati Sardar Patel in Rajasthan.
We salute Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on seeing this nation and our Mother India built in a bond of listening.
The birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on 31st October of India will be even more special. On that day, we will dedicate the statue of the Statue of Unity to the nation while paying homage to Sardar Patel.
The height of this statue built on the banks of Narmada river in Gujarat is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty statue in America.
This statue is the tallest effigy of the world.
Every Indian will feel proud that the world's highest effigy is on the Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, whoever belongs to the soil, will also increase the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when Indian soldiers landed on the land of Kashmir and protected Khori from the smugglers.
This historic moment is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old child of India's great army officer Sam Manikshaw.
In that childhood, Field Marshal Manikshaw was reminded of the time when he was a Colonel.
On 31st October, our mother is also the death anniversary of Prime Minister Smt.
I respectfully paid homage to Mr.
My dear countrymen, don't anyone like sports
In the world of sports, Spirit, Stength, Skill, Stamina are very important.
The country which has these qualities in the youth of the country will not only progress in sectors like economy, science and technology but also in sports.
Our Para Athletesna, who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018, got the opportunity to visit.
In this competition, India won a total of 72 medals and added a new record and respect to India.
I am fortunate to meet all these revered para athletes personally and I congratulate them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that in the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth have achieved the best ever.
In this competition, we received three more medals in Mix types besides 13 medals.
You must remember that India's performance in the Asian Games of India was also excellent.
See, how many times I have used the best, the most glorious words of the world.
This is the story of Indian sports, which is taking a new height every day.
India is not only in sports but also in those areas which have never been thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who has won a gold medal for the country in the Asian Para Games 2018.
He is a disabled person from birth.
When he was eight years old, he had the legacy of his wife.
Then it took eight years to an orphanage.
After abandoning orphanage, life drive was done as a waiter for the DTC buses and for the roadside structures in Delhi.
Today Narayan is winning gold medals for India in International Competitions.
Friends, India has never won any Olympic medal at a synonym or junior level in Judo.
But Tababi Devi won a silver medal in the Youth Olympics.
16 year old sportsperson Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
Their wives are mazurs and their mothers work for fishing.
Many times it was time for his family that he had no money for food.
In such a situation, Tababi Devi has no morale.
He made history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson and his stature is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organised the FIFA-17 World Cup in 2017.
The entire world had praised him for taking very successful sports.
In the FIFA Under-Seventin World Cup a new record was played in terms of number of visitors .
In different stadiums of the country, more than 12 lakh people looted the joy of football and enhanced the enthusiasm of young sportspersons.
India is fortunate to organize Male Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar this year.
The Hockey World Cup is scheduled to be held in November 2018 and runs till 16th December.
Whether every Indian is playing games or playing games, he has an intimacy towards hockey.
India's history in Hockey has been written in gold.
In the past, India has won gold medals in several competitions and at one time India has also been a world champion.
India has also given hockey many great sportspersons.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
Hockey's architect Tejer Dhyanchand is known all over the world.
After that, from Balwinder Singh Sinier, Leslie Glorius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai, Hawky has traveled a long way.
Even today, the sportspersons of Team India are motivating the new generation of hockey by their hard work and dedication.
There is a good opportunity to see thrilling faces for sports lovers.
He visited Bhubaneswar and encouraged not only Indians but also other organizations.
In the meanwhile, along with the enjoyment of sports, you can also see the Sun Temple of Konark, Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and several world famous sightseeing and sacred places including Chilka Lake.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men's Hockey Association for this competition and assure the 125 crore Indians standing with them for their support and support.
I also convey my best wishes to all the organizations coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kind of voluntary service that people are coming forward for social work is inspiring and encouraging for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, new generations, new hopes, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward today.
A few days ago, I had gone to a programme, where a portal has been started, the name of the self-force society. MyGov and the IT and electronic industries of the country have started this portal by encouraging our employees to provide them with such opportunities by encouraging them to social activities.
Every Indian will be proud of the enthusiasm and intimacy that they have for this purpose.
The journey from IT to Society is not me, we are not arrogant, it is a smell of journey from age to age.
If someone is teaching children then someone is teaching senior citizens, someone is engaged in the work of cleanliness, someone helps the farmers. And there is no desire to do all this but a spirit of dedication and resolution.
A young man learned a wheelchair basketball to help the disabled Wheelchair basketball team.
This spirit is dedicated, this is a unique initiative.
Can't any Indian feel proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was watching people's information about Mann Ki Baat, I got to see a charming tip of Shri Manish Mohapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on Mygov, Please speak on this thing that in Mann Ki Baat, the heritage and tradition of many tribes of India are the best examples of natural harmony.
How we need to adopt the tradition of sustainable development in our lives, we need to teach something from them.
I commend myself for enhancing this topic of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter that inspires us to look at our glorious history and culture, today the entire world, especially the Western countries are discussing environment protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
However, our India is not out of this problem, but we are not only trying to get rid of this problem but we have to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities, we have to see our rich history and traditions.
Our tribal culture has been a part of our collaboration with Nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and plants like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil Adivasi tribes of Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship Pimpal and Arjuna trees.
In a deserted land of Rajasthan, the University has shown us the path of environment protection.
They are particularly fortunate to sacrifice their lives for the conservation of trees, but they are not fortunate to lose a single tree.
Arunachal Pradesh prays for their relationship with Mishmi tigers.
They also consider them as brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland the tigers are seen as the protectors of the forests .
The heritage community of Maharashtra considers the tiger as a refuge and brings prosperity to the tigers.
In the Kolkata community in central India, it is believed that their fate is linked to the tiger, if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will have to suffer.
In the reproductive season of the Gond tribe of central India fishing stops in some parts of the Ketan river .
In the remotest part of the Nilgiri plateau of South India, a small Bhatta community is built traditionally by locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community is very peaceful and comfortable, but if someone is harming their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters belonged to tribal communities.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought a loud fight against the British government to protect our wild land
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about the individuals and institutions who have done something unparalleled for the society.
This kind of work seems to be difficult, but in reality, it has a great impact on changing the mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmers of Punjab, Bhai Gurbachan Singh.
The son of a common and difficult farmer Gurbachan Singh ji was born.
Before the marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we are making a simple effort to fight the bride's mother.
There is no need to spend a lot of money and other things.
We have to celebrate this event in a simple way.
But he suddenly said, but I am an integral part.
Nowadays, when the issue comes to the fore, it is simply assuming that something in front is going to be a big demand, something like this will be difficult for the families of the bride.
But you will be surprised to know that this is the true power of our society. What he said is the true power of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji said that we will never burn our fields.
We can imagine how big social power is there in it.
But we have seen how vast his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform the individual event into a social event.
The family of Shriman Gurbachan Singh ji has given us such an example.
I have read about Kallar Majra, another village in Punjab, which is near the navel.
Kallar Majra is talking about the use of technologies that can be used for soil mixing with narrow soils rather than burning cereals.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh Ji
Congratulations to all those who are doing their best to keep the environment clean and to the people of Kallar Majra.
You are leading the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle as a legend.
The quantities of sea-building that make the sea, they play a very important role in creating a small activity and awareness and positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our texts: "Santi: Intersection Shanti : Prithvi Shanti : Prithvi Shanti : Drug : Prince : Shanti : Visvadeva : Shanti : Visvadeva : Shanti : Brahma Shanti : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : .
In life, in heart, in me, in you, in every part of the world, in every part of the world, everywhere peace is established.
Peace: Peace: Whenever there is talk of world peace, Indias name and contribution will be reflected in the golden chapter.
India has a special significance for the 11th November of India as the first major battle was concluded 100 years ago on 11th November.
These incidents are completing 100 years, that is, a century will be accomplished by the massive destruction and loss of human beings.
The first major event for India was an important event.
We didn't have to give anything directly to that war.
However, our soldiers fought with courage and played a very big role and gave the highest sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when there were wars, they were not less than anyone.
Our soldiers have shown valour in the inaccessible areas.
Or the whole would have been the only purpose - the restoration of peace.
In the first Mahayana, the world saw all the dictatorships.
According to the estimate, about one crore soldiers and more people lost their lives.
With this, all the world knows the importance of peace.
The interpretation of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today the meaning of peace and harmony is not just war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, we need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a genuine responsibilities of peace.
My dear countrymen, our Northeast is something different.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unparalleled and the people here are very talented.
Our Northeast India is known for its best work.
Northeast India is an area that has made a lot of progress in organic farming.
A few days back, Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
The award is given by FAO, affiliated to the United Nations.
You will be happy to know that this award for making the best policy is with Oscars in that area.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this award by placing 51 Nomadic Policies in 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October has come to an end.
We are experiencing huge changes in the weather.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for these festivals.
I urge you to take care of yourself, take care of your health during these festivals and also take care of social interests.
This is an opportunity to take a new decision.
This determination should lead to a mission mode and make a solemn pledge in our lives.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The more you progress, the more you progress, the more the country will progress.
