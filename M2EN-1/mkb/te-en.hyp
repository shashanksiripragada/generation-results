Man Ki Baat, October 2019
O my beloved countrymen , worship .
There are many ruins of yourself in the contribution of Deepavali .
It is said that in this world light brings happiness , health , prosperity in life , which destroys the opposite opposite .
Festival tourism is a special attraction in the world .
Festival is an important occasion for the people of India in the festivals of the country.
Therefore, the role of Indians residing outside the country in encouraging festival tourism in India is very important.
My beloved countrymen, we are determined to do something new to this Diwali in Mann Ki Baat.
On seeing this as soon as the stories of social stories were discovered in social meditation .
This day our brethren are in good professions.
She is really Indian Lakshmi .

All these Indian Lakshadweeps have written a poet in the language of Kannada at that time in 17th century , my beloved countrymen , in 17th century .
These emotions , those emotions , Indian Lakshmis , now we all say that the foundation of all we have been done there .
How important things , how important emotions , how excellent thoughts , poets are such .
Because of the magnificence of these archaeologists the future of our society , excitement .
My beloved countrymen, on 12th November 2019, Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will celebrate the 550th anniversary of the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not in India but in the whole world .
Our brothers and sisters of Sikkim are residing in many countries of the world and they are totally dedicated to the shrine of Guru Nanak Devji.
I have never forgotten the journey done by the Vancouver , Tehran gurudwara .
How can I tell you about Shri Guru Nanak Devji, but it has many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the place of service .
It is believed that the service done with the emotional emotional emotions of Guru Nanak Devji is invaluable .
They were opposite to social illusions like unconsciousness .
Shri Guru Nanak Devji has exhibited his message to the far countries of the world .
They were one of the people traveling more during their time .
They went to many places , wherever they went , they spent their hearts with silence , listening , simpleness .
Taking Sadbhavan , equal messages they went to all the directions in the north - eastern west , everywhere with people , sages , sages .
It is believed that the famous saint of Assam Shankar Dev also got support from them .
They traveled the sacred Haridwar .
Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
Sri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Rajgir, Gaya of the Buddhist religion.
Guru Nanak Dev had traveled Sri Lanka .
During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During a Udasi, Guru Nanak Dev visited the neighbouring areas of Kashmir in the north-east.
They traveled to Uzbekistan , they were not even worshipped .
In a Udasi, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They were bought in the minds of lakhs of people . Those people followed their preachings with complete devotion , today they are following .
A few days creative about 85 countries Raibas had gone to Amritsar from Delhi .
There Amritsar Sir Golden Temple was visited , Guru Nanak Dev Rei . 550 shining festival .
Here not only do the visit of Golden Temple , but also the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
I am an anointed to bring their thoughts , ideals , ideals in our life .
Then once I am giving support to Guru Nanak Dev .
It is believed that my beloved brotherhoodrimanala , October 31 will definitely remember all of you .
If you read about the work style of Sardar Saheb , then how strong is their planning .
Thousands of people have to come from all over the country to participate in the Congress Conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the administrations of the administration were on Sardar Patel .
He also used to illuminate the Net work of water supply in the city.
Who has been built without deficiency of water .
Not only this , you will be surprised to know that in the meeting place the things of everybody , shoes and shoes are not stealing .
They contacted with rails , made expensive bags .
At the same time the victory of Khadi was also shining .
For playing the role of Ulkhani in the state the Sardar Patel will never be able to fulfil our country .
On the basis of Kullu , tradition they did the main work of determining the primary hiccups .
Sahacharala , the first Home of India Shakh Mantra of India is a great Bhagirathi , historical work done by including Sardar Ballabhbhai Patel Institute .
Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the division of India in 1947 our neighbouring country is on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Immediately after knowing this news for Sardar Patel he had taken difficult churches without wasting time .
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering after inaugurating the Trivandrum in Lakshadweep.
Immediately with his country Trivarna Patna had spent all the neighbours of Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I believe that these beautiful islands , sea shores will be visited by you .
My beloved countrymen, the Statue of Unity, which became the memory of Sardar Patel on 31st October, 2018, has been given the status of the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
It is double higher than the Statue of Liberty of America .
The highest statue of all the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
On an average, eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of Statue of Unity every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has declared his belief , devotion of his mind , besides this many attractive centres like Kakts Garden , Batter Fly Garden , Jangal Safari , Children New ealand Park , Ekta Narsari are being developed respectively .
People are getting new opportunities every day and the facilities of the tourists are being provided in their homes by the people of many villages.
It is our testimony to how the world famous tourist area grows in a year.
People come from the country and abroad .
The government has played its role .
In this meanwhile, Time Magazine cannot be proud of any Hindustani in the top 100 tourist destinations of the world.
I hope you are going to see the Statue of Unity in your invaluable time.
At least 15 tourist destinations in every Indian who want to travel and travel in India will have my request to stay there for a night.
Friends, from 2014 to 31st October every year, we are celebrating the Jati Equity Day.
Today, we have a message to save the country's ambition and uncertainty.
As soon as October is organised for Ran Fort University .
In the last five years, apart from Delhi, in hundreds of cities of India, in central states, in districts, in smaller tours and in more than 3 cities, women, inhabitants, villagers, children, youth, elderly, Divyangs, everybody is meeting in large numbers.
Whatever is today we are seeing an interest , zeal on Marthan in people .
Run Fort University is also a special opportunity .
Running mind , brain is beneficial for body .
Therefore, not only the body, but also the mind and culture, to bring India to new heights for India's ambition.
Therefore you can know about the Ran Fort University around you .
I believe that on 31 October India will definitely participate in the race for your fitness as well .
My beloved country residents , Sardar Patel have sat in the opinion of the country .
Iueen Mantra is like our life culture . In the country with diversity like India , every way , every museum , every museum , every museum , every museum .
My dear countrymen, our society is always keen to fulfil the rich heritage of the country.
If we see around us , many such examples are found , in those examples they are constantly working to increase the mutual potential .
Organisations try to forget those situations according to their benefits in their own way .
How many types of words used to talk to increase the temperature in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some scholars , important goals are not only known for their famous people .
We remember how responsible things are talking .
But all these five days , seven days , ten days are going on , but on coming to judgment we saw a joyful , surprising change .
On one side this has been done for increasing the excitement of two weeks , but on coming to Ramjanmabhoomi the government , Rajiki birds , social institutions , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations .
Try to reduce excitement in the environment .
But those days I remember very well .
The pride of justice has been agreed upon, wherever there is no chance of excitement and heat increasing.
These things should always be kept in mind that they give us strength .
Those days those moments , teach us .
Ikta Stupa gives so much strength to the country this is an example .
On the day of a big injury to the country .
I also dedicate my faith today .
My beloved countrymen, today a story of the house is listening to afar off the shores, the story of every village is listening to a story from the north to the south, from the east to the west of India that is a story of cleanliness.
Every person , every family , every village wants to tell his happiness experiences related to cleanliness because the attempts of cleanliness are an hundred thirty crore Hindus .
Their fruits are also an hundred crores of Hindustan .
There is an experience of making a happy thrill .
Not only separating the garbage in it , it is also a very important task .
In it , removing 130 tonnes around glacier , this is the biggest service of the delicate environment there .
That is also a place of rare species of snow leopards , where there are rare animals like Siachen species , sheep , wheat colored bears .
We all know that these Siachen rivers are clean water sources, glaciers.
Therefore the work of hygiene i . . people used to give water to the lower areas from here along with giving clean water to the lower areas .
My dear countrymen, the festival is a celebration of a new consciousness in all our lives.
The other Deepavali meaning specially buying something new , there is more reduction in the family of symbol .
I told once that we should try to buy things available locally .
If we get necessary things in our village then for them we do not have to go to Talluka .
I once again tell you many blessings of this festival of Deepavali .
And the candlestick we are of various kinds .
But sometimes salt gets supplied by carelessness .
My many ruins .
Thanks a lot.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Nobody was pride to see our soldiers , our weapons .
Any species , any place , any religion , or any language is always ready to know our soldiers , their happiness , Madhuni .
All the 125 crore Indians have celebrated the tradition of circular strike in 2016 .
In the three decades of the territory war on our country , the soldiers of their determination were given in the form of surgical strike .
How much capacity is hidden in us , our soldiers keep protecting their lives by cutting their lives .
The main days like Parakram festival reminds of the heritage traditions like our soldiers in the youth of our country .
Such festivals encourage us to maintain harmony and ethics in our country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan on their land.
In the two world wars happening in the twentyth century our country soldiers gave clean sacrifices for more than one lakh peace .
With the purpose of paying attention to peace in Shantibat it is a courage of our country soldiers .
India is also one of the countries that send soldiers in large numbers to various Shanti Bhadrata teams of the ICT.
The decades our soldiers play an role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet .
My beloved countries , the woods of the sky are unique .
On the 8th day of October we celebrate the day of the air conditioned team .
In 1932 , the smaller air force with six stairs , 19 soldiers etc . increased and our team was one of the adventurous and powerful aeroplanes of the 21st century .
In 1965 the enemies of the enemies had also given the pocket of our flight .
Who knows about the independence of Bangladesh done in 1971 .
The Air Force has also played a key role in evading Kargil from Chorbat in 1999.
On the establishment of enemies in Tiger Hills night and night bound them with soil and also our planet.
The archaeological support , seed construction was done by our airplanes because of the works of the warriors of our airplanes , how much thanks to the country .
Tufa , winds , floods in the jungles meet all the natural opposite opposites , they are marvellous in helping the people of the country .
They are an example of aeroplane in producing equality of women , men .
Now our Air Force is giving alternative to women with short service commission and I have made this announcement from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15.
India can now be proud of the strength of women in the armed forces of India.
The powerful woman is now also adventurous .
My beloved country people , some days creatory of our boating team has fighted with death for his life .
How to save him from the country of Javat
You know that Kada Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous ruler .
Without using any kind of modern technique , only with the help of a small boat the Indian is the first Indian .
To participate in the Golden Globe race in the southern Indian ocean he has been moving ahead in the sea for the last eighty days but the terrible sea storm brought him problems .
But this man of the boating team of India had spent many days in the sea .
He was the biggest example of adventurous , cultural , transgressions . After bringing him out in the sea for a few days Christian he talked with him in phones .
O my beloved devils , how important is the second day of October to our country .
This year October is a speciality for both .
From today onwards, we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi through several programs worldwide.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have given the inspiration of the world .
In 1941 Gandhi Garh Museum started writing some thoughts in the form of a positive program .
Later on the independence of independence in 1945 he prepared his thoughts .
Puja Bapu Railways , villages , villagers , administrations , cleanliness , education have given their thoughts before the people of the country .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is a special identity of his personality .
Bapu has understood how important , important opportunity of the country .
Then thy suspicion is happening , thou feels as if thou hast melted .
My beloved countrymen , this mantra which Gandhi had said is still important .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , shopping power is increasing .
When we went to buy something then remember this mantra which he had said once .
Because of shopping this thing I am giving benefit to any Pauri in the country .
Who is able to enjoy happiness in the Mughals .
This is his message . I believe that in the life of the poor , weaker person you can bring a great change in the life of the person .
It is said that my beloved country people , cleanliness will get freedom from cleanliness .
Although he does not know that India has come to India .
For example , due to shopping of Khadi , fishing products many people helped the workers .
All these mineral clothes are also so difficult but they are not able to make them use each other .
On hearing from outside , from inside the pillars were determined like a mountain , Lal Bahadur scientific scientific scientific science .
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a direct display for the great personality of scientific science .
He gave victory to the soldiers of the country , and to the soldiers of the country , and to the soldiers of the country .
It is common to talk about cleanliness while remembering the priests of my beloved country people .
September fifteen ' Cleanliness ' started a garden .
Crores of people participated in this programme and I also got the opportunity to provide cleanliness to children in the Ambedkar school in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself had founded the foundation of that school .
People of all the classes of the country participate in the contribution done on this September fifteenth September .
Let's hear a phone call.
I am telling you special thanks to your phone call.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention is the world's most sanitation mantras and experts from all over the world come together and share their experiences and experiences in this sanitation session.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded with the commencement of 150th birth anniversary celebrations on the 2nd of October, 2018.
If temporary , physiotherapy , bored people want to give freedom , peace , justice , it is specially important .
Several places have been done for lice in the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
Inspired by them, on October 12, 1993, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established.
In a few days NHRC has been completed .
NHRC has not only saved human rights but has also worked to increase our pride.
Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the Chief of our Majijijid, our beloved leader, has clearly stated that human rights are not our traditions.
In the symbol of the symbol of our national hustle-bustle the ideal spectacle of the spectacle of the spectacle of the spectacle of the period of spectacles is very happy .
NHRC has provided an extensive opportunity for human hiccups, with which the role of hiccups has also been played for stopping the use of hiccups.
NHRC is an ideal, a belief environment in the people of the country in this journey of bonds.
It is my belief that for a healthy society, this is a very optimistic event for the best democracy.
In the national level of Italy along with the work of human handicrafts , the commission of human rights of twenty six countries has also been established .
An effort has to be made to understand the human rights in a society, to bring them into the courts, which is the basis of the idea of SabkaSath, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas.
In the month of October , in the month of October , Jai Narayan ueen Jayanti . In this month the festivals of Rajmata Vijayraja Scindia start .
About these, I will explain in the Mann Ki Baat but I will surely make this proposal. In the last few years, on 31st October, the 'Ran Fort University' is being organised in every small town of India, in villages and villages.
This time also we made this ' Ran Far University ' in every small city , areas , villages , villages .
The program of ' Ran Far University ' is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb .
We will give strength to all the efforts to kiss everywhere in the society by October 31 ' Nurn Fort University ' .
This is the direct devotion of giving him .
My beloved countrymen, Navratri, Durga Puja or Vijayadashmi, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of you on this auspicious occasion.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Yavat India celebrates the sacred safety festival of India .
This sacred festival is very sacred for all the people of the country .

Friends, along with safety on the day of Shravan Puranami, we are also celebrating the day of culture.
It is said that along with taking care of this great heritage , decorated , giving gifts to common people , it is also impossible for all people .
Every language has its own grandeur .
The ancient language of the world is Tamil language which is a matter of pride of all the people of the country .

It is said that the teachers of all the students of the country have told the ruins of the day of the year .
With this the science , education , students will impress you the dedication of your dedication .
My beloved countrymen , this rainy season brings many hopes to our train working hard .
Due to strong sun the dry trees , plants , dry rivers take place .
But sometimes this rainy season brings very lucky , destroying floods .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains are spectacular .
The destruction of leaving behind them is bad .
But on occurrence of danger humanity meaning what we understand .
We all know that the soldiers of the soldiers running in Kerala are the soldiers of the soldiers .
They did n't leave anything to save those who were stuck in the floods .
Air Force but navy, not aarmy, but BSF, CISF, RAF, everybody has played a big role in the efforts to protect and protect.
I specially want to tell about the hard work done by NDRF, how excellent they helped in such difficult times.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the NDRF is capable of taking their commitment , their commitment , and to keep the situation under control.
Ninnam festival .
In order to come out very soon from this danger, we will pray that the state of Kerala should not be given the power of this festival, especially the state of Kerala.
I believe that all the people of the country believe that the people of Kerala are with them all other places , the whole country .
My beloved countrymen , this time I am seeing the informations coming for Mann Ki Baat then I am about one thing .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swan Berji from West Bengal, Akhilash Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, etc.
On the sixteenth day of August the world listened to the death of Atal dynasty , the country is drowned in the Shokadra of the country .
And he was a great land , which left the fourteenth year old prime minister .
If you want to say one way then he went away from the royal palaces of the past .
People made him an excellent parlor , a pleasant architect , a great synonym of love .
Because of being brought in the reproductive reproductive reproductive organs the country of Atal ueen has fallen .
Our thanks to Atal ji for the 91st kingdom regime in 2003.
This environment has brought two major changes in the royal palaces of India .
The first change is that in the number of midwives in the states the number of midwives is fifteen percent .
Atal guide changed it .
That is why the vegetations of money were already .
Therefore the work has increased .
These conditions have begun to increase healthy traditions in our royal culture .
Atal Garhwal is a true country .
During the entry of the budget in his administration changed .
Initially , according to the tradition of the British , the time of parlor in London used to enter the market for five in the evening .
In 2001 Atalji changed the time of the evening to eleven in the morning .
In the same way you are watching the churches of the states , central states once in the country .
This is a good alternative for delivery .
Healthy democracy , excellent democracy , giving good traditions , to make the democracy continuously , to make the democracy , to make the progressive churches , etc . all of us also give the best devotion to Atal .
The worker in Lok Sabha is an hundred and eight percent , the worker of the state has remained seventy four percent .
This rainy season in Parliament will always be remembered in the form of social justice and development of youth.
In these functions many important girls have been adopted for youth , backward classes .
Like the SCT commission of decades there is also a desire to choose Ooty commission .
The country has fulfilled its commitment to appoint an OIC commission to ensure the powers of the backward classes.
It has also given the authority of a state which takes ahead the goal of social judgment .
Therefore by entering the parlor of parlor the parlor of parlor the parlor has entered a difficult training .
According to this the iniquities doing illusions not only less training , in twelve girls in twelve girls are executed .
A few days ago, you were studying in the newspapers, a judge in Mandshaur, Madhya Pradesh, after only two months of interrogation, executed two iniquities in the case.
First of all, in a judgment place in Kathani in Madhya Pradesh, only five days after inquiries were executed.
In Rajasthan also some such fast decisions have been taken .
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness occurring on women , girls .
When we move ahead for the country then we can bring about change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the deprived.
In the rainy season this time everybody has kept an ideal ideal .
It is said that all the parlors of the country are giving thanks to the heart in Bahrang .
My beloved country people , these days the eyes of crores of people are on the Asia creeds happening in Jakarta .
Asia creams are still happening .
I am telling all the players of the country for the country .
If India is fit then India will have a bright future.
I am telling the discovery of the discoverers of Asia once again , along with that other sports also want to see the best exhibition .
Everybody 's national sports festival is spectacular .
Besides this the whole country also remembers him with great pride , spirituality .
In their memory the tenth day of September is celebrated as engineers .
The engineers of our country running in their steps have proclaimed their existence in the world .
It is called 'Bhug' in the coach .
This house has seen three earthquakes .
But at some places you will see any harm .
Our ancestors of this house have been built according to the environment here .
It has been said pride that after listening to it I felt that the engineers of that period before centuries , according to the local conditions , the normal people have done such constructions as living safely .
Now when we are celebrating the engineers then we should also think about our future .
Keep a work shop at every place .
In changing times we learn any new things .
What should be taught to students .
Then meet .
In the meditation many places rains are coming properly .
At some places maximum rains are also coming .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of no rains .
Man has brought opposite to nature .
That is why sometimes nature comes on us .
Therefore the responsibility of protecting nature lovers , nature is our responsibility .
In Thailand twelve Junior football sports hair , their coaches went into a cave for tour .
Normally it takes some hours to come out in that cave .
But the decision of that day is another way .
There was no way to come out that they had stayed near a small cave inside the cave .
Not only in one , two days , but only eight days were left like that .
On one side if they fight with hunger , on the other hand the human species of the world has displayed the human species of God .
All the people of the world have prayed to come out safely .
Those children were stuck where they were in any condition , to know how many efforts were made .
How to take out the water if it is not possible to save them in the evening then it is possible to bring them out for the rainy season .
Fortunately they were safe , as soon as they came to the world peaceful , enjoyed everybody .
But how did the entire program of this protection were done with another point of view .
The responsibility found in every level is unique .
Government , parents , their family members , media , people of the country , everybody has also been seen marvellously .
In this entire behavior a Jawan of Dhai Land has also lost his lives .
It is enough to work on our goal with cosmetic , stable mind .
A few days ago the favorite poet of our country Niraj had left us .
Our Indians can also give how much strength , inspiration .
This is the time of the start of art galleries .
The youngsters who come to July are asking for the most important part of their life where they turn from their point of view to cut-off.
The meditation of students changes from home to hospital .
The students come in the shadow of professor from the shadow of parents .
I believe that my young friends keep enjoying their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
It's time for you to get out of the house, get out of the city for the first time, separate yourself from a fragile atmosphere.
Many youths first come out to give a new direction to their life .
I have told everyone that stay calm , spend life , enjoy your mind completely in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , to mix friends , to keep those friends standing in such a way that it has to be done with many knowledge .
New new experts , new languages .
The student of Assam Chaudari of a permanent family of Madhya Pradesh has achieved victory over all the difficult competitions of his life .
Jodhpur has conducted victory in the first attempt of MBBS test .
And his father did the work of gathering his father , and played his family .
My beloved country people , for a few days creatory attracted a news that two youngsters associated with my vision .
If we read inside then how to bring change in the life of normal person using our youth technology , creatively .
In America once I am discussing with Indian youths once in Sanjoz city called technology hub .
I want them to do something for the country after thinking about how they can use their everybody for India.
By using their professional expert both of them have prepared a memorial ypnotise .
Besides connecting the people of that village with the Yavat world they have to give some advice to Gani , information , it has been available in their own mobile .
In a way, an attempt has been made to bring the digital revolution in this Yap village and it has become easy to record, track and monitor the development work done in the village.
In this Yap, the Phone Directory, Water Department, Jagboy Programme, Health Centre and Information Centres are located in the village.
In order to know the FACT rate between the rural features of the YAP, the market plas is useful for their production.
If you look at this thing indefinitely then one thing is understood - those youngsters are leading their lives in America, where lifestyles, thoughts and ideas are being spent while leaving India for many years, how much small things are being understood in their village, how much is the mentality of their villages.
That is why they can do anything properly in the village .
Situated in its village , this relation with its roots , for the country there is a synonym of one hand , every Indian is natural .
But sometimes because of time , distant situations , on which a thin dust is named , but if someone is touched by a small salt then all the internal things come up again .
Pandarpur is a sacred village in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
One fifteen , twenty days before Ashadakshi i . . Tirthankaras i . . Tirthankaras , pilgrimages along with palanquins go on foot for the pilgrimage .
This journey is called Vari . in which devotees participate in lakhs .
Gyaneshwar , Tukaram etc . are kept in the palanquin , Vithal , Vithal , playing , playing , playing on foot .
The pilgrimages or Vithoba or Pandurang reach there for visiting Lord Vithal .
Vithal Bhagwan protects lice , bowls , paintings .
There are unparalleled devotion , devotion among the people of Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana .
Going to Vithoba temple in Pandavapur, the glory, beauty and spiritual joy there is a special experience.
If possible then I want to feel the experience of Pandapur once .
Innumerable monuments like Gyaneshwar, Namdeva, Aknath, Ramdas, Tukaram etc. are still punishing the common people in Maharashtra.
We get the message of emotional , love , beauty through their famous musical instruments Bharud or Abhang .
Because of this on the opposite beliefs the society of the society is available .
The power of seeing their wrongs for the British rulers is in him .
The English i . . the fear of Tilk i . . in twenty years he tried to stop the royal family three times .
This is not a small thing .
A interesting incident about a Tilk statue located in Lokmanya Tilak , Ahmedabad is participating with the people of the country .
It is said that on 1920 AD when the death of Lokman Tilak Garhwal had done his memorial in Ahmedabad .
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Ahmedabad was selected as the Mary of the cities of Ahmedabad . Venthane his world famous idol Victoria Garden has been named this Garden ueen of Britain .
Finally the idol was built . Sardar Garh had constructed that idol with anyone , 1929 on 28 February 28 Mahatma Gandhi .
The most important thing is that after coming to Sardar Patel the idol of Tilk dynasty is also possible because of his archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological importance .
Due to the efforts of Lokman Tilk the tradition of festivals started .
These festivals have become an effective medium to lead traditional devotion , festival , social good , community , equality among people .
Our old heritage , history standing in the history of the Veer Nakulam also knows how much interest in our youth .
Today in many cities we see to worship by keeping the idols of Ganesh in approximately every street .
Pujas are organised by mixing a team in that street .
This is a unique opportunity for our youth, where it is possible to learn the qualities of nervous system, construction etc.
Good milk , development fruits give every Indian .
All the people of the country also sacrificed his life with the contribution of breathing freely .
I am talking about Chandra Shekhar Azad .
The following words are not inspired to read these words . surfaroshi Kinnaur , Hamare Dil Medakhana Hill Journal Hai i . . . the desire to examine the desire to examine the desire to examine many youths like Absalom , Chandrashekhar , Chandrashekhar , Chandrashekhar .
Chandrashekhar Azad has inspired many youths for independence , independence .
Azad has kept his life according to his life . foreign rule has never been headed before .
In the race of 400 miles in the race of India in the race of 400 miles in Junior Ardar-20 in Christian Finland has created the history of Hima Dascus .

Do you know why do you go to the cloud of Kabir Dascus
It was a belief that on death in Maghar there was a belief that heaven reached .
It is believed that heaven goes on taking body in Kashi .
The magnificence of the magnificence was not believed to be Kabir Das .
He tried to destroy foolish beliefs , illusions situated in his lifetime .
Therefore he went to the cloud and was buried there .
Kabi Das has dedicated social equality , peace , beauty by his churches , palanquins .
These are his ideals .
This ideal is seen in his churches .
In this time also they are inspired with us .
His writing is this - ' Kabir Soy Peer Hai ' , John Peer John Peer John Peer John Peer John Peer John Peer John Peer John Peer John Peer John Peer , so Care Peer ' that is , who understands the problems of the truth is the best example .
Kabir Dascus has shown special attention to social options .

The GST is an important example of cooperative federalism. All the states have decided to implement such a big tax reform in the country.
But all the decisions taken by the GST Council have also been taken with the consent of everyone.
Before GST, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country, but after this arrangement, one tax came into the entire country.

In the year 1857 our Indians showed their goodness to the British in this month .
In many places of the country our soldiers , rails were standing opposite to unrighteousness .
It is a matter of grief that we have to say that for a long time we have to say that only 1857 incidents of hypnotise , syphilis .
But in reality this incident is not only estimated that incident , it is also an attempt to take our self-confidence .
It happened in 1857 that not only rebellion but also our first freedom fighter Veer Savarkar ji was brave .
Savarkar River is a person with many specialities .
He worshipped both weapons , hospitals .
Our virtue reminds of his virginity , to fight against his reign of the British .
But apart from all this, he also gave a brilliant poet, social architect and always gave strength to the emotions.
Our beloved glorious princes Atal Bihari Vajpayee had spent a unique description about Savarkar Riji .
Atal Bihari Wajpai is the right painting .
The poet of Savarkar walked with both poets , cranti .

Due to the reason of mountainous region the rails are not available properly .
The rails of Kapkot region have discovered the way to increase the price of selling girls directly in the market .
Because of the excess of iron minerals in all these fruits this iron element is very beneficial for pregnant women .
All these rails have been organised in the Munar village , where the factory of making these biscuits is opened .
The Government has also contributed to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).
Now apart from approximately fifty anganwari centres of Bageshwar district apart from Almora , Kausani centres .
We hear that in future wars take place for water in the world , people of my favorite country .
Everybody says this but nobody is responsible .
The conservation of water is that we feel that we are responsible for a social responsibility .
How to pay attention to the drops of rains
All of us know that the conservation of water for all Indians is not new thing .
Not only in books but in language it is not a matter of beauty .

Mann Ki Baat February 2018
This question has given a great scientist to our modern India .
Before talking about science we were talking to India Sir C . .
His research was famous by the name of Raman Effect .
On one side there is a tradition of the main scientist Bodhgaya , Bhaskar , Brahma Gupta , Aryabha etc .
On the other hand the physician , Charanda is our pride .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Har Gobind Khurana and Satyendranath Bose are proud of India.
The main parlor of the name of Satyendranath Bose has also been done .
In the meantime, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai - Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is very interesting to know about the wonders happening in science .
Through Artificial Intelligence, robots, boats and other special tasks will be helpful in manufacturing instruments.
In the middle of these instruments also increase their intellegence even more .
This technology is useful in glittering the lives of many lice , baads , needy people .
Is it possible to get any help from the Artificial Intelligence to change the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters
For a few days, I got the opportunity to go to Ahmedabad in Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel for the inauguration of 'I Create'.
I saw a design made of a young man there .
I want to use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
The price of science and technology is stable .
There is no price for them .
Every instrument how we want , only works .
But through instrument we do any work which depends on us .
Here human goal is the main goal .
Science not only for human welfare but also for stopping the excellent peaks of human life .
Thams Alva AIDS has been successful in its research many times .
It is a matter of fortune that I am in the Auroville of Maharshi Auroville.
Similarly in the form of a Maharshi he asked everything in life .

To know the truth how important thing is to keep questioning every time .
I am telling all our scientists , scientists , scientists , scientists .
Friends, at the time of calamity, on subjects like Safety, Disaster, many times people keep coming to me.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion.
Safety standards are not very important in our country where factory and construction work is being done.
On the fourth day of March, National Safety Day, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has asked for some precautions regarding Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat programme.
In daily life we do not take precautions about Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get Bhadra at the time of problems .
Their concentration - the danger arises - the destruction causes harm - the destruction of joy , the joy , the joy and the joy enhances the bondage so quickly - do not play with the Bhadrata - do not lose life like that .
On crossing that path one can not use all times in our life .
But if natural opposite opposite , more dangers occur due to our layer .
We can save the society from big dangers, not only to save our lives, but also to save our lives.
There are many information about Bhadrata at one time but nobody participates properly .
I want to make a microscope in front of the children of various schools once in a week with the archaeologists of the cities , cities of metropolitan cities once in a week .
This country has faced many chemical, industrial accidents in many natural and man-made dangers.
These are the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which is manufacturing the main seed in the country.
On occurrence of various kinds of dangers like earthquake , floods , storms , etc . , the NDMA reaches there as soon as possible .
Besides this, they are also organising training programs for capacity building.
In the districts coming to floods , temporary Tufas a program was organised by the name of Apada friend for training .
Training , best role is how important role .
Two-thirds creator Lu i. e.
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to heat gardens in 2017 is estimated to 220 .
Therefore, it is known that if we give importance to Bhadrata then we can be safe.
In the society where there is such obstruction in the society , innumerable people , social incidents , social incidents , best Pauris .
In the leadership of India, a Joint Dissolution Exercise has been conducted with the name of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal etc.

Normally we keep traveling in airplanes many times . In the beginning of air travel the information about Air Hostel Bhadrata is being given .
All these informations are also heard many times .
But if someone takes us to the airways , where is life jacket , how to use it , then I can surely say that nobody can say peace properly in us .
There is a chance of seeing them clearly .
That's it.
But we do not pay attention .
That is why we are sitting in the airways, our ears are listened to precautions, but we all think that they are doing our desire.
We consider every hole of life as well .
We should not consider this Bhadrata not for us .
If we all are very best for our fragrance then the society is also international in it .
My dear countrymen, this time we started a programme keeping in mind the issue of waste to wealth, waste to energy i. e.
GOBAR-Dhan means Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The Gobar Dhan aims at cleaning the villages, making the lice of animals more sensitive to COMPOST, BIO-GAS and generating energy through them.
The number of animals in India is approximately thirty crore and their lice is thirty lakh tonnes.
Some European countries , Chinese animals , rest of the animals , remaining centres are produced to produce energy .
But they are not used in the whole state of India .
The Swachh Bharat Mission is now moving forward in this direction.
A goal has been set for producing energy based on biogas from the vains available from animal lice , central vaccine , etc .
Under Gobar Dhan Yojana, Ratu brothers and sisters in rural India have to be encouraged to see licensing, vandalism only as a means of attracting wealth.
The health of animals becomes shining , their production increases .
Because of bio gas , lighting cosmetics increases in the subject of energy .
This technique helps in increasing the custom of rail , animals , animals .
New gardens increase for vasectomy , transplant , cerebral palsy , etc .
An online trekking platform is also prepared for the realization of Gobar Dhan Yojana which connects rails , shopping .
I would like to utilize this opportunity by organizing a self-help brigade and cooperative societies, especially in the rural areas.
I want to invite you to participate in the Clean Energy and Green jobs and ask you to change the vacuum in the villages of Tadwara in the direction of making Gobar Dhan.
My dear countrymen, we have been listening to several types of festivals like music festival, food festival, film festival etc.
But the festival of vandalism was organised first through a special effort at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
The purpose behind this festival, which was started by the Raipur Municipal Corporation, is to ensure that the vaccination of the city is not negatively utilised, and not using vaccines again and again.
Everybody participated in various programmes under this festival till the elders of the students.
In some remaining districts inspired by Raipur also vain festivals have been done in various ways .
Every year on the eighth day of March international women are celebrated .
There are many programs in our country , worldwide .
That is, we are talking about women-led development by moving ahead from the age of women.
In this context, I am reminded of the words of Swami Vivekananda - the idea of perfect womenhood is perfect independence - a century ago, Swami Vivekananda's idea of Nari Shakti expresses the spirit of Nari Shakti in Indian culture.
In the tradition of recognizing women we were participating in the tradition of recognizing women , the sons of Kausalya , the sons of Gandhari , this was the identity of every son .
Now I got information from Jharkhand .
Approximately fifteen lakh women in Jharkhand - this is not the smallest number - about fifteen lakh women have been involved in a month's cleanliness campaign.

The pilgrimage occurring due to ten sons is available with one daughter .
This shows the importance of women in our society .
Any excellent example of Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitrei
The arrangement of Ahalyabai Holkar administration was done , Rani Lakshmibai , the sepulchre of the woman , whenever we were inspired with us , the pride of the country saved the pride of the country .
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many examples .

In the social changes happening in the country , society of the country there is an important role of the women of the country .

There women were in all parts .

The view of this adventurous experiment has also surprised all the guests coming to the country and abroad .
This is a form of self confidence of women , self confidence .
These are giving our women nervous system .
Travellers are changing .
Another thing has come in my sight . Our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have seen an important example .
It is a matter of tribal women i . . everybody 's heart is seen to be a picture of a jungle , in which the women carrying the weight of binoculars on the heads of the women are seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture of the country .
The Maoists have created a terrible environment in the Dantewa area of Chhattisgarh with Hins , Attachments , bombs , guns , maoists .
In such a dangerous area tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this - ray .
During immense time many women met in it .
Therefore three benefits are being taken . on one side self-confidence has made them healthy .
Leave the unconsciousness in our hands , accept changes in important places .
It is a speciality of our society to read himself .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been found in our heritage .
For some days creative Bihar has taken an interesting new wave program .

Through this program the opposite opposite to the marriages of children , vertebral illusions .
The whole state has been determined to fight against the ill effects of child marriages , vertebrae etc .
Children , elders , enthusiasm , mothers , sisters , everybody participate in this fight .
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, these human halls are connecting people with the borders of the state.
If all the people in the society are properly developed fruits, then the society should be freed from such bad methods.
Come , let us all enjoy such bad methods from the society .
A New India will build a powerful, capable India.
I am impossible to make the people of Bihar state , main minister , where the administration of the administration , every person participating in that human society in the direction of their society .

He stood as a topper in the Kashmir Administrative Surveys test after being expelled from acute pain, hate chains.
In 1990 acute paintings burned the house of their ancestors .
The rapid pain , hyssop is so much that their family had to leave the land of their ancestors .
All around such a hyssical environment is enough to fill darkness , cruel thoughts in the mind of a small child but Anjum does not allow such a thing .
He never left hope .
He had chosen a new way for himself .
He came out from the opposite environment and came to his victory story .

But to discover this problem , to change the problem , to tell the way out of the problem , how important is the support of the people to know how important example the temple of Shabarimala temple .
Shri P.

The most important part of the earth is soil .
The symbol of our food is connected with this soil .
In one way the entire food chain is covered with soil.
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life possible
How is the cost of living animals possible
Earlier this thing was discussed in our culture and this is the reason that we have been at the forefront of the ancient times of soil.
On one side of our culture, efforts have also been made to create a feeling of devotion in the people of fruits, soil and soil, on the other hand, soil nutrition and some other scientific methods have become a part of our lives.

We worship the earth but how much the health of the earth gets spoiled by the floods .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that due to the necessity of more than necessary redness it has been proved by the scientific tests .
Global warming , changes in the environment , we are feeling all .

Some people are like the point of view of some complications , some social problems .
Once in a month, I take your time for half an hour but people keep on reaching their words for words in Manas in the month of fifteen days.
That is why the journey of talking in this mind is the journey of all the people of the country , feelings , feelings .
I am telling thanks to all the people of the country for giving me the opportunity to understand the common feelings of India in such a short time .
Now three scientists have been fulfilled therefore social scientists , university scientists , media specialists do its position .
But such poisonous churches are very useful in the future in the mind , a good memory , new enthusiasm .
After that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths have come to me .
How many people who think that leaving the rice left in the Kanchenjunga have come in my sight , how much happy I had enjoyed .
Once I saw a Selfie With Daughter photograph in Haryana and told everyone about it in my heart.
On seeing, not only in India but also in the world of Yavat, a big garden called 'Selfie with Daughter' was started.
This is not only a matter of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self-confidence in every girl .
Everybody wanted to take selph with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , it has been believed that it has its importance .
I am sitting in the tourism department of India for some days .
It is said that if you are going to the journey there then incredible India -LRB- unusual India -RRB- then we will send photographs there .
Then lakhs of pictures coming to India from different parts of India , in a way the work of tourism has been done very big contribution .
I am experienced by talking in the mind how big accident can be lifted up .
On coming to the counsel of the completion of three times many incidents were stirred in my heart .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
It is said that every Pauri in the country , for the society of the society , for the progress of the country , something or the other .
It is a matter of learning and learning from the people of the country in the propagation of my three minds.
This is the biggest power of any country , the biggest power .
I am worshipping the heart of all the people of the country .
I talked about Khadi once in my mind . Khadi is not a cloth , but a thought .
Discounts are given in Khadi girls about October 2 and a lot of reduction is available .
I want to increase this mineral in such a way that I want to increase this mineral again .
Due to the increase in the interest of the Khadi patterns, the enthusiasm of thinking in a new angle has also increased in those working in the Khadi Rang, the Government of India.
How to bring new technologies , how to increase the power of production , how to bring the handicrafts of the work with solar power , how to revive the ancient tradition of 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years of age etc .
Many people have been produced .
Resumed the training centre of Khadi and Village Industries, which was closed at Pennor in Kashmir, there is a lot of work in Kashmir to provide this sector.
Now, the training centre will help in building new generations, building new things and ensuring that the big corporate institutions will be able to select Khadi goods to make them affordable.
People also started selecting the things of Khadi while giving each other .
Some things naturally go ahead and come into the experience of all us .
My beloved countrymen, in the minds of the Christian month, we have decided to celebrate the festival of cleanliness throughout the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti.
Our glorious President had started this program.
Children - elders , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been participated in the proposal of this campaign .
As I said that with culture I am able to walk ahead in any way we are seeing before the eyes .
Everybody has adopted this procedure , giving its support to support it .
That is why the jewellery of the jewellery is telling thanks to the president of the jewellery .
Along with them every class of the country is also considered to be its own work . Everybody has done this procedure .
They, students, schools, art galleries, university, rails, coolies, police, children, jawans, everybody joined this.
If these places are dirty then people do not feel hungry and there is a possibility of this pressure in those who work there .
It is very good that more than seventy five lakh people, more than forty five thousand people have participated in the programme in the four days of Swachhata Seva.
Some consequences are continuously working with the goal of showing results .
This time we have also seen a new thing - one bed programme and the other beds are being carefully taken care of.
If you want to change cleanliness in one nature , emotional garden is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by clean service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have been prepared .
The pictures about cleanliness with their own hustle-bustle .
Blessed is the media of the media when the word of the synagogue cometh , and I forgot .
We are watching the serving of electronic media, print media and the country as clean as well.
In the midst of this meditation somebody told me about the eleventh girls of Sri Nagar .
It is said that if you make this Bill Darbar as your brand Ambassador for the administration of Srinagar Portuguese then you will be happy that Brand Ambassador i . . Brand Ambassador i . . Hero of Sini Rang .
Not only .
Billal Darbar kept an eye on the cleanliness of his twelve-three years of age , past five decades .
He is the inspiration of all those who are interested in hygiene in age .
I am giving many impressions to Bill Dar .
We confess that my beloved country people , future history , past history .
This time Nanaji Ridi , Pundit Din Dayal is also the year of the Red Fort .
Does the cost of all these great men know what is the center of cost .
One common thing situated in everyone is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
Nanaji has left the life of the country , leaving the life of the royal family , it is natural to celebrate their curiosity that their village program is pride of pride .
The President of India, Shri Abdul Kalam, spoke to the youth, every time Nanaji was talking about the rural development of the country.
The meditation of Din Dayal Meditation of Mahatma Gandhi was also talking about the last person sitting in the society .
We also run for the unity , let us move ahead the mantra .
The oneness in diversity is usually considered to be the speciality of India .
We pride the diversity but when you try to feel this diversity .
The nearest airport from Deepavali is at a distance of 2 K . .
Everybody is a common thing to go to tourists .
However, people don't see our country, they don't know the diversity of the country.
Our country is full of many options .
All these Mahabharatas have also been developed in the country .
Before starting this work , an attempt has been made to understand the country .
Try to fill India in itself .
My own experience is that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
I got the opportunity to spend the night in more than four hundred districts .
I would like you all to feel that the unity in diversity is not only a reflection but also a vast country of India, our immense strength.
One India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power of our country tourism .
My suggestion is that if you want to go out in your holidays , changes , do not understand anything , learn , go out with the goal of learning .
Visit India within you .
Your life is rich with these experiences .
Your thought is large .
The cost of experienced milk remains .
Normally from October to March is very good for tourism .
Definitely send your photograph in the incredible tag incredible table.
You can also send pictures of humans at places .
Not only the identity of construction , not only natural beauty but also come about the life styles there .
Can you put in the incredible text
You see, I would like to tell the government that everybody from one state has discovered from the best information and that the government has to create a literature about the seven places that have come in large numbers.
The Government of India works on them .
Government provides information about pictures , videos , procedures , encouragement by encouragement to them .
Come , walk with me .
You can also change a big excitement to use the time of March for the month of October , to encourage the tourism of the country .
I am inviting you .
My beloved country people , many things like a man .
My mind recognizes .
Leaving deep effect on my mind .
No matter how much I am like you .
Why is Asaman says that while doing service to India their husbands are not heaven .
We can imagine how their condition becomes unconscious in small age .
With the eleven months she trained her life with difficult industry , to make her husband dreams .
Although the husband of Nidhi Dube had returned to the death by working in the army of Dubey .
His wife also reached in the army .
It is natural for every Indian to have the pride of this maternal power , our pride of these virtues .
I am telling the heartbeats of these two brothers and sisters .
He gave new inspiration , new excitement to the forts of the country .
These two brothers are many opinions .
My beloved country people , Navratri festivals , Deepavali festivals have a big opportunity for the youth of our country .

My beloved country , Navratri festival is celebrated .
Durga Devi is worshipped .
The environment is sacred , aromatic .
On all four sides there is a spiritual environment , festival , devotion .
All this is considered to be the festival of Shakti.
These are also called Sharda Navratri . Till now the ruins of the body start .
O my beloved countrymen , and worshipped .
On one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand, it is natural for the country to worry about the hypocritical messages from some or the other corner of India.
This is the country of the birthplace of Sardar Patel , the birthplace of Lord Buddha , the country of Gandhi .
The ' Ahimsa Parmodh ' . ' We came to hear it while listening to the smaller time .
I also said from the Red Fort - it does not endure violence with the name of beliefs, but it is a traditional belief.
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedkar , every person has all kinds of arrangements for getting justice .
I believe the people of the country that those who take the chatti in their hands , they are absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely unsuccessful .
Our festivals are also full of many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of some thousand years we found cultural traditions , social traditions , historical incidents , everything , therefore in the year some day it is not possible to finish with any festival .
All our festivals also keep on coming according to nature .
Everything is also directly related to nature .
Jain society is celebrated every year .
Jain society is celebrated in the month of Bhadrapad .
The festival of Purushu is celebrated on the day of Akhri .
Actually this is a unique tradition .
The festival of year is a symbol of forgiveness , non-vegetarian emotions .
My beloved country people , today everybody of the country is celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi festival with grandeur .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to come to the matter of Bahraang - Ganesh Festival .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak ji gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago, which was a symbol of freedom struggle.
After independence they stand a symbol of education , social consciousness .
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated for ten days .
This festival is said to be a symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
The festivals of Ganesh festivals of all the people of the country are many ruins .
Now the festival of Omam is celebrated in Kerala .
In the colorful festivals of India the Omnam of Kerala is a major festival .
This festival tells social , cultural importance .
The festival of Onam presents the important cultural heritage of Kerala .
This festival awakens new enthusiasm, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and compassion in the society.
Now our festivals also change their attractions .
Navratri Festival in Gujarat, Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become their attraction in a way.
Our other festivals are also useful for attracting foreigners .
In that direction we should think what we can do .
The festival of Id-ul-Juha is celebrated in the tradition of these festivals in a few days .
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-Juha.
Festival meaning belief is a symbol of faith .
Festivals should be made symbol of cleanliness in the Navbharata country .
This is not new for us but changing it into a social habit .
Cleanliness is not only in the house but also in the entire village, in the city, in the city, in the state, in our country and in our country, a special part of the festivals of cleanliness and cleanliness.
My beloved countries , modern meanings are changing .
These days, no matter how innovative your thinking is, all these things have become a new coin, a new coin, a new coin.
Therefore in the days of this festival everywhere the soil of environment has started .
If you see in the YouTube , then in every house children are making soil of soil .
Some vegetables are rubbing colors , some colorful papers are pieces .
The people of media House are also giving inspiration , guidance to make the idols of soil suitable soil to the environment .
See how big change has come .
Enjoyable change.
As I said , our country is full of marvellous thoughts of crores of crores .
There is a lot of fun on doing new descriptions .
Some engineer himself told me , he got some special kinds of soil , mixing it , giving training to the people making soil .
After puja if that galaxy is done in a small ball then the idol melts in water immediately .
I started cleaning three times . October coming to it is completed three times .
The consequences of this park are seen .
The construction of toilets has reached about 67 from 39.
It is said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahraang was free from excretion .
Fearful floods have come in Gujarat in the middle .
Many people lost their lives .
But after the flood water many odours spread .
During this period, two-and-a-half-hour flood affected workers at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat were purifying three mosques.
He saved everyone by sweating his sweat .
The attempts to make dedicated to the supreme emotional nature changes our country at a height of more than the other .
In one way Deepavali , Navratri , Durga Puja is considered to be adventurous .
Go to the bus nearby , go to the village nearby , but consider this as a garden .

I have become a big opportunity to know the words of all the people of the country .
The more you wait for words in mind , more than this I wait for your messages .
They come into use for the work .
Once some things are included in our habits , we also think that we are surprising .
'Prince Garu, I am talking from Pune indefinitely.
I want to tell about my friend.
She is in an attempt to help people but a habit of her own habit has mercy me .
I went to shopping mall once with him .
On one pus two thousand rupees were expensively expensive .
Pizza has been kept for 450 rupees but the auto driver going to shopping mall has been done for five rupees .
On the way the vegetables were left 4,5 rubbers on one vegetable .
I did not like it .
Not only this , if you go to buy sarasam in Shoruum then it is not possible that if someone works with poor people then there is no unconsciousness .
Do ye ever think that what does the poor take
In your life there is no importance of two rupees , five rupees but your small habit can wound the hearts so deeply when you think .
My thanks to you, Madam, to tell me through your phone call.
My country people also have a habit of producing such a habit with their poor , they believe that they will definitely change .
My beloved youth , August 29th honey is celebrated throughout the country on the day of national year .
This is the birth of the great hockey player , Haki Mantra Mejar meditation .

Come forward in our country's youth sports. I warn you that this is a very important role in the computer age .
Play FIFA in the computer but in the outer plains also show fitness with football .
Cricket plays in the computer but the joy of playing cricket under the sky is different .

Tomorrow, on 28th September, the Prime Minister will complete three years of Jan Dhan Yojana.
Three crores of new families have opened Jatpurcha , Bank Khatas with this .
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .

It is understood that in the days of coming what good work is done then money works .
The poor now sees his pocket card in his pocket , seeing himself like riches . If there is a crade card in their pocket , then it is satisfied that there is card in my pocket .
It is considered its pride .
Approximately 65 thousand crores of rupees were celebrated in Bangkok by our poor people in the prime minister January .
In one way this is their strength in the days of the coming of the poor .
Who has become expensive by the prime minister January , they also got the benefit of Bima .
On the occurrence of obstruction of poor , if the main person dies in the family , in some days they get two lakh rupees .
Because of reproductive yoga , insurance , reproductive card , prime minister mudra physiotherapy , they have done any benefit for common people .
I make a complete attempt to reach them .
Because of such inspiration the media can also get complete benefit .
Such people can give new inspiration to new generations by prasing their face .
My beloved countrymen , once again forgive yourself if there is pain in  sweet potato ' .
In rainy season the mind of man is very important .
Animals , birds , goats , nature , everybody becomes lukewarm due to rainy season .
Change in environment is changing with the changing season , its effect is also very fast .
In the last few days natural obstacles have to face natural obstacles in some places of India , Assam , North-Eastern regions , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal .
My friends of the ministry are also reaching that place if possible.
The state governments also provide the best help to the afflicted with floods in their methods .
In such situation the help of people in social institutions , cultural institutions , services are helping them in their own way .
The Government of India is happy to assist the Military Jawans, Air Force, ANDRF week, and those who are stuck in danger at such times to help their lives.
Due to floods the life of people becomes very unsuccessful .
Fruits , animals , cultivation , roads , electricity , information etc . are affected .
Especially when our Ratu brothers , fruits were destroyed then they were not destroyed , especially the beans companies of the fruits , especially if they were making a clinical centres immediately before them .
In order to face the situations of flood the control of 24 hours is working continuously on November 1078 .
People are also distressing their difficulties .
Gradually we will also be able to save ourselves from harms as per these environmental information.
I am going to make more people of the country than I am preparing for the programme of Manas.

I am feeling the impact of GST on transport and logistics.
How fast the changes occurring rapidly , magnificence registration has created a new belief in the country .
Scientists and technologists of the economy must study the use of GST in India and sometimes stand before the world as a specimen.
This is a case status of all the university of the world .
Because with such a big height , such a great change , with the effort of crores of people in this large country it is a very big task to lead it ahead in victory .
Definitely the world researches on this matter .
All the decisions have been taken concentration by mixing state , government centres .

If you want to say a way , this is a social collection .
For making such a big attempt easy victory once I am giving a fort to all the residents of the country .
Beloved my country residents , August month meaning option month .
On 1920 August the support of 1 support of support started naturally we were listening to the smaller time .
The uit India Movement was launched on 9th August 1942, which is also called the Opportunity of August.
1947 August had come to the country of 1547 .
If seen in a way , all the incidents occurring in the month of August are also especially engraved with the history of freedom fight .
We should know what happened in August 9th honey in 1942 .
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom movement that the people of the country have been driven by, whichever effort has been taken, is an inspiration for the construction of our emotional India.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians led their lives in the garden with the mantra of 'Doo Or Die'.
Lakhs of youths stopped their studies , left books .
Men like Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan have played a major role in the garden.
In 1920, the uit India Movement in 1942 showcases both the forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
Assistance has increased rapidly in 1942, a great man like Mahatma Gandhi has also given the mantra of 'Doo Ordinance'.
I would like to once again roam the history of India, the first freedom struggle of India started in 1857.
Then the initial freedom struggle was going on some or the other corner of the country in 1942 .
This Surgha period has produced freedom in the hearts of the country .
Everybody was ready to decide something or the other .
This industry which happened in 1857 to 1942 had reached the last stage of 1942 .
The garden of uit India has changed so much that in 1947 the English had to leave the country .
1857 AD this independence of 1942 reached all the people of this independence .
Besides this in 1942 along with the five storeys of 1947 all the people were decided to give independence to the country with one mind , contribution .
These five storeys are like a spot .
Now I will mix you with a past .
In 1947 we came to freedom .
Now 2017.
Approximately seventy years were spent .
Government has come .
The arrangements have been made , Marai , increased , increasing .
Everybody has tried to come out in the problems of the country .
As soon as I had spent 2017 the five storeys of Ndi 2022 were also drowned in the contribution of five storeys .
Try to complete them .
For example, from 1942 to 1947, five thousand miles for the country's independence
These five , i . . 2017 i . . till 2022 should be given miles for the future of India as well .
After five years the independence of the country is celebrated .
Therefore all of us should make this a strong alternative .
Make 2017 our contribution year .
Every Indian, social organisation, local institutions, schools, art galleries, diverse institutions, everybody is committed to a New India.
Come , this contribution is our part .
Wherever we are, we are certainly in the online line, so I want to come forward especially through the online world, especially my young friends and my young friends to help them build a New India with creative methods.
Use technologies bring new ideas like video, posts, blocks, taxi, new ideas.
This procedure is a population .
In the NarendraModiApp, we are also inviting uit India quiz for young friends.
This uiz is useful in connecting the youth with the glorious history of our country and introducing freedom fighters.
I believe that you will definitely spread in all directions by making an expansive proposal of this attempt .
My dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, the Red Fort will get the opportunity to talk to the people of the country from the Red Fort.
100 crore people from the Red Fort revive the festival of Red Fort.
It is an attempt to give the form of words to those dreams that in the last three years I should talk about 15th August , which information , advice is being given .
This time too, you must send your thoughts to MyGov or NarendraModiApp and I invite you.
In the last three August 15 delivery I heard that my delivery takes a long time .
Therefore I decided that this time the time of my progress was less .
My beloved country residents , I proposed another thing .
There is a social meaning in the economy of India .
We should never detect it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not just enjoyable .
Our festivals, our festivals are also social museums.
But along with this our festival is also drowned directly with the economic life of Pauri .
In a few days protection , birth , Vinayaka Chaitya , after that Chaturdashi , Durga Puja , Deepavali .
Before some months before the economic arrangement of economic arrangement Rakhi starts making Rakhi in small domestic industries in lakhs of families .
The trade of thousands of people who make Rakhis , Rakhis selling sweets , thousands of people drowned with a festival .
Our poor brother , brotherhood families were spent because of this .
Not only a festival of lights but also a festival coming to the house .
Its relation is directly associated with the families of the poor families making small soil .
But I am talking about the festivals , while talking about the economic arrangement of the poor people lying with those festivals , along with them I also want to talk about environment .
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are very high , active .
In the last months the best people were written to me for environment .
125 years , 125 crore people of the country .
At the same time we will say that for environment conservation environment friendly Ganesh i . . soil is worshipped .
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of the country for the festivals of different festivals.
Beloved my country residents , education , economic , social area , playing games , our girls keep on giving new goals to the name of the country .

A few days creatory has exhibited a marvellous sports in the competitions of the women of our country .
In this week I got the opportunity of getting Bhenti with those games .
I enjoyed talking with them very much , but not able to spend the world camp .
In their pimples also this disappointment , pressure has been seen .
If the players of India were smitten then we saw many games breaking on them with anger .
If you were not able to wander , then you spent 125 crore people ' s hearts .
I told those games that in reality the youth of our country , especially our girls .
On the other hand I tell my heartfelt congratulations to the youth of the country , especially to our girls .
It is also remembering that 75 years of our independence come to 2022 .
Every country should make a sign of five dates for its cultural heritage .
The beauty of the country , future is best .
Blessed are many ruins of you all .
The more we are in conflict, the more stressed, the more we live, the more we live, the more we enjoy each other, the more we live, the more we live, the more we enjoy each other.
Jagannath Rath Yatra is being celebrated in many parts of the country with utmost satisfaction.
This festival is also celebrated in some places of the world .

On this occasion, he decided to construct all the villages and dollars.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also reached the gathering during this week.
But our habit does not change.
This is also the case with cleanliness.
We have to steadily strive to get rid of such illnesses.
The incident took place in the Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
Its goal is that during an hundred hours the construction of 10 thousand monasteries in 71 villages Panchayat .
Beloved my country residents , during an hour the government , people will give you a very happy pleasure in constructing ten thousand toilets .

Praswamy is not only a arrangement but also a culture .
Reproductive system is very important therefore we should take about the subjects to discover the delivery .
First of all the good things related to delivery .

Take it in hand once , leave it again .

I told everyone again .
Its many people gave me a lot of happiness .
Everybody has an enthusiasm to tell their things .

But after seeing the contact I realized that some attempts to learn music , some are trying to learn new things , some are trying to learn new things with the help of Europe , some are trying to learn new language .
Some are learning cooking , some are learning dance , some are learning , some poets started writing .
Try to know about nature , living , understanding direction .

How many acquaintances were I influenced by the ruins of Bhagt Singh in small age .
Therefore, I would like you to give a message to the youth about this thing.
I am very happy to learn about the history of our country, about our freedom fighters, about those who sacrificed their lives for the country.
The number of great men had lost their youth in jail .
Those great men who spent in jail in freedom fight , reading , writing etc . have done a very big work .
We also know that India has given a lot of strength to the freedom movement of India .
Many years ago I went to see the Cellular Jail of Andaman - Nicobar .
The poets used to come on the walls .
He was bound in a small dark room .
Have the lovers of freedom experienced any sorrow
When I read the book 'Maji Janmathe', I am interested in seeing the Cellular Jail.

If people experienced any kind of anxiety for our freedom , if they go to Cellular Jail , why do they know that I am going there for the youth of the country .
If you are also possible then definitely go to this pilgrimage area related to our freedom fight .
Dear people of my country , June is one Monday in 5 months .
If you want to say another thing, back to basics.
It is natural that batter plate is increasing .
Who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi said many times, 'The one most care about a world one will not see'.
That is , we should also think about the world , take precautions .
You must be observed , the power of nature is that when a glass of water gets tired then how fresh it comes .
On getting tired properly the room opening the windows , opening the doors , sucking fresh air comes .
Therefore we should also give our own attempt to drown with the natural beauty of June .
Our ancestors are now available to us as a result of protecting environment .

Five days before I go, seven days ago, ten days ago, a very big cleanliness program will be organized.
The country knows how much carefully all these things , you can imagine this thing , how much joy can you imagine .
I also congratulate all those who encourage this cleanliness program.
Somebody gave me advice .
The advice of reality is very simple .
I do not know whether I can do it .
Modi Garu , when you decide your tourism then what kind of tourism you want to call me Babu , how much will your cleanliness level be
The alternative is good but I should think .
But such a garden should be made . It is a very good thing to clean the garbage of so many tons by cleaning it .

One person , one ordinary Pauri this incident has increased with my enthusiasm .

Probably arrangements , people have become a habit of these problems .
The subjects of children , youths , elderly experiences etc . are coming in my sight .
If someone comes to cough while traveling in the bus , train , then immediately someone comes and gives some advice .
Advice , information is in our nature .
Many people try to reach me , to give advice some or the other in their life .
With the instrument of some good hand they keep changing their intelligence , energy , capacity according to the situations .
Some people also tell advice about their advice at the place of working , the rest of the people who have heard that they have become a convenient form for everyone .
Not only this when I proposed something then it would be very happy to remember such things .

These great men are remembering , on the day of the independence of the state on the occasion of the independence of the state i . . 2022 , we have all our states , our society , our society , all our families , where we can reach our families .
Make a plan to establish this culture . walk ahead with the help of all the people .
On the second time these two states are my many ruins .
In our country the rapidity of summers living in the months of May , June has to be felt in the month of March , April .
That is why when I consult advice for this time in mind , more quantity of advice has been given advice to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also published but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that Balkani had to keep water for birds , birds .
In many families even small children have seen this work .
Once if this work comes in their eyes , then birds come and see whether there is water in the bowl or not .
We get such a game but in reality it is a marvellous experience to raise experience in minds .
Although in our country the subjects related to animal birds , natural life have been very well known but it is necessary to give strength to such efforts .
When I was the chief minister of Gujarat then Daudi Bohra society came hundred years to Guru Saidana .

Give new use .
Use should be positive and should bring you out of your comfort zone.
We are of the happy families of the middle class .
What is the matter of those travellers , what do they do after getting down at the station
In the evening go to the bus stand filling with your foot ball , wali ball or other games .
Play yourself with those poor children , then see that you will get the joy of enjoying life in that game .
If the children spending such life in the society get the chance of playing with you then what changes come in their life .
I can say with faith that if you go once again .
This experience teachs you a lot .
To reduce technologists , borders have come to destroy the borders but how the ill effects of it have changed that six people living in one house are also in one room to imagine the beauty of those who are in the middle of them .
Are you able to spend time with you away from technology
If we pay attention to our country full of many opinions then we get to learn something around us .
If you do not swim , learn this swimming then try to give something or the other on the eyebrows .
If we feel small tasks then we can not learn some tasks only .
You can learn to walk but when you want to learn auto rickshaw .
You can come to pick up a cycle but do you ever try to carry a trichakra vehicle to take people
You see , these new attempts , new experts will not only give you happiness , but will also pull your life out in it .
Keep showing the Indraja of your friends .
I am told with my experience , how much we can not imagine to learn the world as much as we can not imagine .
Look at new places , new villages , new cities , new villages , new villages , new places .
But if you are going somewhere before going , then try to see a gymnasium there , to see a gymnasium , to ask people , to ask them , to see those places is different .
Therefore you will get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends , this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity .
New generations are getting rid of the river bank near the river.
They do not need the river .

Normally in our country there is a climate of VIP culture .
Now the red light on the vehicles is also not able to say that the red light entering the brain has come out .
I am speaking to Shiv Chaube from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, the Prime Minister of Namaskar.
I want to talk about the government decided red beacon light ban.
It seemed very pride to me .
Now my time has also been enjoyed as much as possible .
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam.
I want to know the blessedness of my heart by this decision .
The Red Fort is a part of the Red Fort by the Government .
The importance of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country is a New India emotion.
In place of VIPs, it is clear that my emotions are important.
Every person has the importance of every person , every person has importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then how much power is there to fulfil the importance of 125 crore people of the country , to make great dreams .
This work should be done together .
Dear countrymen, we will never remember our history, our culture, our tradition.
Therefore we get energy , inspiration .
This year we are celebrating a thousand Jayanti of Swami Ramajacharya with all the 125 crore people of the country .
Because of some reason we are not able to take so much that how small we think that more than one century is thinking .
Use cosmetics .
It is also so difficult to come out of the society of the society .
How was it before a thousand years
Ramajacharyas have done very big fight against the society of the society , descriptions , innerness , species etc . during their time .
They observed the society by their own jewellery , they all were hungry .
Before thousands he was given permission to enter the house , and to enter the house of all them .
It is our fortune to keep the great men from our society to end the evil of that time in every age .
Today we are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Ramajacharya, we are inspired by him in the effort to promote social unity.
To morrow the Government of India has released a Tapala Billa in the memory of Swami Ramajacharyas .
I am telling the customs of Swami Ramjacharyas , I am dedicated .
Dear countrymen , to morrow there is another speciality of Tarikh .
It is celebrated in many places in the world as the Day of Shramik.
It is natural to remember Babasaheb Abedkar Garhwal on the day of trouble , when there is a discussion about troubles , it is natural to remember .
It is said about Babasaheb Ambedakar , Swami Ramajacharyas , if the twelfth century of Karnataka , the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society .
In the twelfth century, he made deep thoughts on the subject of hard work and hard work.
In the Kannada Bashan he was called Kailas .
It means, 'You can achieve the attainment of the house of Shiva with your industry.'
That is , heaven is available only by doing karma .
On the other hand if you want to say , it is a distress Shiva .
It is natural to remember the guests of Datta Tangdi while talking about the troubles .
Beloved my country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapuri .
All the followers of Lord Buddha celebrate the festival of Buddha .
On the full day of Buddha it is my fortune to celebrate desak Day through the United States .
This seventh is done in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
Their memories are available to remind them .
My dear countrymen, we have always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India.
When SabkaSath, SabkaVikas is being developed in India, it comes not only to India but also to the world.
Especially our two countries also come to our country .
Our two countries should be helpful in the development of developing people .
Many experiments are done .
May 5 India has used the museum of South-East Asia .
The capacity of this museum , how useful is the economic , economic , economic , development of South Asia .
This museum helps in comparison to natural forests , television i . . medicinal i . . electronic science between people .
People of my beloved country , sunshine are fast , save yourself , save yourself .
Maximum number of families of the country are standing in their children 's test .
In the families of those who have been tested there is a complication of cosmetic environment , tests done in the families of the tests .
In such a situation I can say one thing , listen to what I have said to the students in the Manasseh for the first time .
In a historical war happening against unrighteousness Bangladesh has achieved victory without victory .
On such a special day independent Bangladesh 's brother Paulu , brotherhood , brotherhood , brotherhoods have told many ruins of free day , Bangladesh wants to go ahead in the development of development .
India will continue to support the development of the Yavat region by mixing it with you in a strong and comfortable place for Bangladesh.
The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are pride with the heritage of our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the birthplace of our Guru Govindranath Tagore .
One interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that Nobel Prize was given to him in 1913 and not only did the British give him Knighthood.
In 1919 when the British created Marahom in Jalianwala Bagh then Rabindranath Tagore was also one .
This incident is the time of showing strong effect on the mind of a twelve children .
In childhood to spend playing this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 the twelve dynasty was the beloved of all of us , inspired Amarvi Bhagt Singh .
These three days creative March , on the 23th day of the month of March , on the other two friends Sukh Dev , Rajguru English were climbed to Urmamb .
This incident Bhagt Singh , Sukh Dev , Rajguru without the death of three , the happiness of service of India remains .
We can not even keep the story of the life of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru .
The British empire was afraid of these three .
While they were in jail , how were they in the glimpse of the British .
Therefore everybody had to impart training on 24th honey in the month of March , March 23th day of March .
Besides this their deaths were stealed by bringing them to the Punjab region .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time then a kind of expression occurred in my body .
Whenever I get the opportunity, I am suggesting the youth of the country to visit Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Maternity and Batkeshwar.
At that time calling for independence , its rapidity , its quantity is increasing .
On one side these were inspired by the youths like Bhagt Singh , Sukh Dev , Rajguru .
The truth was done by Mahatma Gandhi Champaran on the 10th day of April , 1917 April .
This is the year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the freedom fight of India the Gandhya Wadh , Gandhi Righa behavior style was known during the Champaran for the first time .
Specially this incident is a miles in the entire journey of fighting for independence for freedom movement .
During this time the contemporary contemporary concert , Kheda Satyagraha , Millal Carmittee of Ahmedabad , in all these the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi , behavior style of behavior will be seen strong .
A man who returned to India in 1915 is only two works.
The power to know the civilization of the people , the Indian society , the power of the British empire , the people of the British empire , one to fight , to inspire , to fight , to fight , etc . Mahatma Gandhi has shown the marvellous powers of Mahatma Gandhi .
If we know about Gandhiji during the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary life of any person starting ordinary life then it is necessary to know how much the contemporary museum .
How to start ordinary life , how much industry Gandhi had done in his own industry , how much can he learn from him .
Like Rajendra Babu , Acharya Kripalani Riri we sent Gandhi Garhwal village at the same time .
How to learn the color of freedom fighting in the work of people , how to fight it .
One unparalleled child is in the work style of Gandhi .
The desire of hundred crores of people to bring change , this is the strong foundation of India .
There is a desire , a culture , an enthusiasm .
Beloved my countrymen, if we come out of the entire life of cosmetics, if we see the works happening in the society with cosmetic cosmetic cosmetics, if we try to understand what is happening around, then the goal of people will be determined to do something or the other for their own responsibilities, not only for their own responsibilities, but also for the society.
That is also like a penance , meditation , like a closed service they are doing their work .
Everyday there are many people who serve the patients by going to the hospital .
They are all running along with blood donation .
How many people who give food to food habits .
Once it has been seen in the form of a collection , incident .
All these are not celebrated with the treasure of the government , non-government , government money .
But when you look at the country then the dream of New India, the dream of crores of people of the country, is visible in front of our eyes.
It is said that every Pauri religion should be determined .
Then the same New India starts a ruin .
75 years after the independence of India by 2022, we will remember Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru.
Champaran museum .
Can we also participate in the journey of 'Swaraj to Surajya' by separating our lives
In the last few months there is no weather in our country , very big people have participated in the garden of design , design .
After the rubbing of the mouth many kinds of designs can be seen in the methods of various designs .
The beginning of Bhim Yap is only two and a half months , near one and a half crore people have done this ypnotise .
We have to lead ahead to fight against the people of my country , black money , which is celebrated in water .
Can the people of hundreds of millions of countries contribute two and a half thousand crore digital goddesses during this year
We declared in the budget.
If they think this work done for hundred crores of people of the country then there is no work of playing for one year .
You can complete in six months .
All these can be done in daily life .
Because of this you can not imagine how much service you can do to the country . Black money , which can become a soldier in fighting against water .
For giving all these to the people , to make people chaitanists many programs have been done in the last few days .
Such hundred programs have been contributed in the country .
80 - 85 programs have been done .
And they said unto them , These are the magnificences made for businessmen , and seventy thousand .
Everybody wanted to lead this work ahead .
First of all April 14 Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti is finished .
On completion of hundred days a big last program was celebrated .
The biggest drama is determined in it .
It is believed that Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti remains so much time with us , as much as possible Bhim Yap is being published .
Do not reduce the behavior of the river , do not reduce behavior with mouth .
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to have many kinds of advice when I asked for advice for words in mind.
But in the matter of hygiene pills are present every time .
The eleventh class reading wounded girl Deh Ra Don sent a message and honoured Prime Minister Garu, Prime Minister Garu, greeted you with my pride.
First of all in these numbers you are many ruins to spend with maximum oceans .
I want to speak in my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness .
People travel daily on a river polluting a lot of garbage .
This river comes to our house on the Rispna bridge .
I recognize it .
I want to get angry in the hearts of hundred crores of people .
Once the anger starts , if we are satisfied , then we start applying something or the other .
It is very best , active partner , the garden is so important for them .
But cleanliness is always covered with a habit .
I believe that this feeling awakened in children , students , students , youths of the country has a good result .
We know that we have eaten food in our house , in sufficient feasts also we keep eating food in our concentration .
It is seen that there is difficulty in eating after putting everything in the eye .
Half of them wearing in the belly can not be put in the belly , leaving there .
Do you ever think how much harm we are quitting these fried things
If you are not able to swallow it then do you ever think that the stomach of all lice is full
It is not a matter of understanding .
It is said that in our house how much food can be eaten on eating small children .
But it is such a thing that family is also good for family .
They made some mobile yps .
In every state of our country such people will be seen at some place .
Water life also does not leave us as much as we can eat , it gives us sports .
See , these are the ways for change .
Those who are cautious of body , health caution then keep a little empty in the stomach , keep a little empty in the belly .
Therefore the matter of health is that April 7th Tarikh is World Health Organisation .
The Universe Health Coverage (UHC) of 2030 was decided on the goal of 'Health for All'.
This time April 7th April has been paid attention to the contribution of the World Health Organisation .
According to one estimate people are suffering from mental depression on 35 crores of the world .
The danger is that we also like to talk about this thing in the people around us.
The person of depression is also not talking about it because that person is also ashamed to discuss about it .
I want to tell the people of the country that there is no freedom from depression.
When a psychological environment starts getting rid of .
The first mantra is that instead of suppression x-ray is necessary .
Tell your friends , mother ' s parents , what do you think with meditations , meditations , meditations .
Children residing in the habitat sometimes have so much difficulty with loneliness.
The beauty of our country is that we are mixed with the big families of the spitting families and therefore there is no size of depression .
It is believed that the first step towards depression .

Our country has done an important task to lift up our head with pride before the world .
They have completed many unparalleled experiments in the ice AIDS -LRB- Isro -RRB- for some time .
The ISRO has established the world record in the space sector for a few days after successful uses such as 'Mars Mission', 'Mangalayayan' etc.
Once the history created by sending 104 museums in the space of 104 museums is India .
It is a matter of enjoying the use of 38th victory over PSA .
This is not just a 'Isro' but also a historic work for India.
This space programme, run by ISRO with very low cost, has become a wonder in the world
The scientists of India have displayed this victory with the heart of the whole world .
The main among these 104 museums of brother brother brotherhood , the museum of India is 2 .

The next question related to India Bhadrata of India has also been put .
In this matter India has also proved another important success .

In the protection also India Balistic International Missil has been tested successfully .
Their tuberculosis technology has recognized the tuberculosis of the enemies by identifying the tuberculosis of the enemies at a height of 100 kms from the ground in its use.
Our Indian scientists have seen this .
And its power is that if there is any tug-off to capture India from a distance of 2000 kilometres, then our tuberculosis has the power to destroy it in space.
On seeing new technology , when we get a new victory then we enjoy .
In the journey of human life Talluku has played a very important role .
Special scientific , everybody does not let their gymnasium like a gymnasium .
The same gynaecologist becomes the cause of new research .
There is no peace for their questions , but scientists will not sleep .
If we look at the journey of thousands of years of development of human life, then we can say that there is no such thing as the journey of development of human life.
It is impossible .
Everything , creation rules , human mind keeps on continuously trying to know the mind .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
My beloved youngsters, scientists, scientists, while talking about the difficult industries, I have been saying that many times in Mann Ki Baat, the attraction of science in our youth has increased.
There is a need of many scientists of the country .
Today scientists become the cause of a permanent change in the life style of the coming generations .
Mahatma Gandhi says they have dropped in a perfection in the skies.
Science should always be kept in mind the needs of ordinary people , how can they use their principles naturally , what technology is beneficial for them , because how useful is the most beneficial for common man .
To identify such creations , to exhibit them , to give information to people , how to produce such creative instruments for people , how to produce them very high , how to use them , how important work has been done on seeing them .
And I saw a description .
In 2005 maximum rains came in Mumbai .
Its meaning is that in the society , in the country , in this kind of role humans are very flocky .
Our society is also very technological direction .
All the arrangements are also run in the direction of technology .
In a way technology has become a different part of our lives.
In the last few days the vagina of design is very strong .
Gradually people are moving towards digital consciousness leaving the river .
Digital Ladwa Devi is also developing very fast in India .
Especially the youth is a habit of conserving their designs from their mobile phones .
I am considering this a sign .
A few days ago, the Lucky Grahak Yojana and the DG-Business Yojana in our country got heavy relief.
Through these two methods an attempt has been made to convert the river in India into a project.
In this plan more than a hundred Khatadas got the prize according to the lakh rupees of each other .
More than four thousand traders got the gift according to fifty thousand .
Or do I also ask this poisonous description that the elders of the elderly also participate , I am also happy to know that apart from fifteen years of age apart from sixty and seventy years old .
Expressing his happiness from Mysore, he received a thousand rupees in the Laki Grahak Yojana at NarendraModiApp.
And he said , I have received a thousand rupees , and the name of Hakkadar seemed old , and gave her a thousand rupees .
Travellers keep on telling things related to digital .
How enthusiasm things are encouraged , others also encourage .
The Puja of Maharashtra Nindi Pizzi is today the same young friends also use RuPay card, E-waylets in their family, how much enjoys it in their family, how much enjoys their experiences with their friends.
The number of lakhs is so priceless that he has taken it as a garden , others also encouraged for this .
In my eyes , everybody related to this work is a new opposite team of this country .
One way you're a clean soldier.
April is a drama of 14 crores of rupees .
There are 40,45 days near it .
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
A few days creative Baba Saheb Ambedkar had taken 125th Jayanti .
You should also teach at least 125 people to do BHIM APP down to remember them.
This time give special importance to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti , BHIM APP .
Therefore I say that we strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb .
Include 125 crores of hands in BHIM APP by going home.
The effect of this garden happening in the last two - three months is that how successful in many villages , many villages , many cities .
Beloved my country residents , the economy of our country is a big pillar .
The economy of the villages gives strength to the economy of the country .
I want to tell you a pleasant thing .
Our Ratu brother , brotherhood filled our grains with so much trouble .
This desert has been produced in the record level with rail labor in our country .
All the signals say that our rails were bound all the old records .
This time the fruits in the plains , everyday Pungal , Baisakhi festivals are celebrated .
This year about two thousand seven thousand tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country .
This time 8  more than the emotional record named our rails is emotional .
This was so much successful .
I am specially impressed the rails of the country .
Because apart from traditional fruits they were able to keep in mind the poor people , various kinds of pulses were cooled because the poor give the most protein with pulses .
Keeping in mind the necessity of rails in the country two hundred ninety lakh hectares have given me a lot of joy in the land of various kinds of pulses .
This is not only the production of various kinds of pulses , but also the great service of the poor people of my country .
My prayer , all my supplications , my country Railways have produced records of pulses , therefore my brother brother brothers and sisters have special opinions .
My dear countrymen, some work is going on in the direction of cleanliness through the government, through the society, through the society.
In a way everybody seems to be very behavior related to cleanliness in some form .
The government is also trying continuously .
Six houses toilet pits were empty and repaired them .
Twin Pit toilets were empty , then the rulers had seen the methods to use those toilets again .
How do we clean other cleanlinesss , these toilets can also be cleaned like this .
Because when an ice authority cleanses the toilets themselves then it is natural to attract the eyes of the people of the country .
It has also been proved .
Six members are filled in five stard towels for the family .
After that the cotton can be easily turned into another pit .
In six to twelve months the garbage reached in the toilet goes completely .
The government takes this way , others also use such before .
Clean bird festivals keep on continuously in various parts of the government .
The Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr.

This is not just a government program .
A social communication has become a public education program.
Last two programs attracted the minds of common people .
This problem imagining the people of the country has thought that the behavior of the behavior of the people of the country has changed into the thoughts of people .
As soon as the girls were born , how much joy is there when they know that they are celebrated .
In a way the fame of the girls increasing in the girls is because of their social civilization .
The nearest airport from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is Karipur International Airport .

Man Ki Bath , August 2019 .
Today our country is enjoying rains on one side .
On the other hand some festival of the originals of Hindustan , the fair of Deepavali keeps on happening .
Perhaps our ancestors , in any situation the weather , economic cycle , economic cycle , society .
Till now we have celebrated many festivals .
The birth of Sri Krishna Festival has been done throughout Hindustan .
The cost of such personality , even after spending thousands of years every festival takes a new sport , it gives new energy to someone imagines .
Today I am talking to you about two important moments .
One of the Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan , one of the Charkhadhari Mohan .
And when Sudarshan Chakradhar had left the bank of Yamuna , and went to the sea shore of Gujarat , and was established in the gate of the sea shore , then Mohn the son of the sea shore came to the Yamuna , and spent the ends of life in Delhi .
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan had used his intelligence , his ability to stop the war , to stop the war , to stop the war , to stop his intelligence , his ability , his scientific worry .
At the same time, India is at the forefront of another big festival.
Not only India , this is the church of the whole world . my beloved country .
I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served the rails being recognized in the conservation .
In order to remove many illusions related to the disease of blood pressure they themselves have served the patients of blood pressure .
It is an example of his life by service .
We can understand this thing directly from the life of Bapuji .
The person , society , humans , humans were specially this .
Finex Farm of African , Tal Stay Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardhana , all the places in its special way , the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society .
All these emotions of society , society , society , cervical cervix , mobilization are important for us in our environmental life .
The truth is that this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi , real work .
We are connected with people in the society , together with all classes , all age groups , all the age groups , the village is a man or all together , we think that I can do my attempt .
It will be better if my generation is adventurous .
Community is our strength .
In the program running this 150 years of age there is no community , service .
Our woman is Ladys Club .
We will do the work of Ladies Club in modern age, but we will all work together in collaboration with Ladies Club.
We can do a lot.
Panching the books , knowledge of the poor , such 130 crores of Indians , 130 crores can be started .
There is no limit in the mind - good anointing, good comfort, compassion can be served with complete emotions.
It is also a satisfaction if it is for a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat for a few months ago.
It is a very important factor in the freedom struggle.
I participated in the beginning of the modern museum given to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi .
By this others also write three four words while expressing your emotions with those photographs .
During the time of coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been done .
But in this context one interesting thing is to participate with you .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world come together.
This time an interesting exhibition was organized with Gandhi memories in Venice Biennale's Indian building.
In this Haripura Panels is specially interesting .
The confluence of Kangras in Haripura of Gujarat , in which the history of Subhash Chandra Bose will be remembered for you .
This art is a beautiful past for Panel.
Prior to the Haripura Convention of Kangras, in 1937-38, Principal Nandal Bose of Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan was invited.
Gandhiji administered the exhibition of his art work in this meeting to showcase his lifestyle in India through art.
The art work of our state is this Nandal Bose .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
Along with the artistic art gallery of this Boss dynasty has captured his own .
Tourists visit the villages around Nandal Bose Haripura , at the end a art canvas was created by showing the life of rural India .
There was a great discussion in Venice about this invaluable art exhibition.
I would like to make a pledge from Hindustani along with the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Gandhiji.
Do something for the country , society , others .
The same is Bapu's right, real function.
This time it starts from 11 September .
At this time we will come out of our houses and dedicate to Mahatma Gandhi with hard work.
Homes , streets , but sandalwood , but art gallery but in all the public places cleanliness should be organised .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
I told how hundred and a half crore people of the country were encouraged with enthusiasm , energy , I told that in Bahraang places free from excretions .
And we all must stop Single Use Plastic.
In this procedure all the classes of the society are enthusiasm .
By this money remains , in the protection of environment its role is played .
This time in the context of celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of October Bapu , Bahraang was dedicated to him not only to India released from excretion but also to the opposite of plastic.
I am giving a gift to all the classes of the society , every village , every city .
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated to free India from plastic garbage .
All the Municipality , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , private arrangements , all the institutions , everybody has to be administered with me that plastic leaf should be administered .
I invite all corporate sectors to explore how to make arrangements for Disposal if this plastic was fixed at one place.
It can be recycled .
It can be indulged .
Today I want to tell a very important thing with a culture .
There is a lot of importance of food in our culture .
The more we met the knowledge of food in science .
In Nutrition Abhiyan, nutrition is being created in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting methods .
Once the matter came into my eyes .
In Nasik, a major thrust of finished corn has been made.
In it in the days of harvest anganbari services are provided one pinch of grain from the people .
This grain is made to make women , children hot food .
In this the person donating donation is a guide of the society .
This culture is celebrated during the feeding the first time to the child .
Liquid diet is not honourable .
Gujarat has made a thought in 2010 . Why should not it be necessary to give complementary food to children in this matter
This is very important , which can participate everybody .
In many states people eat food .
A marvellous function of service , happiness is spectacular .
Brothers and sisters , through many small methods our country can be affected by fighting with malnutrition .
Today the right information or poor , snakes are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated as a Nutrition Abhiyan throughout the country.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was sure that there were many questions about this matter.
Over the past few weeks, I met the people where I went and there was a proposal about 'Man Vs Wild'.
I have not imagined that the chance of refreshing the hearts of the world has come in my life .
But what happens .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As Prime Minister, whenever I visited, I am passing through one thing - I am talking to someone else in the world about Yoga for five minutes.
I am talking about Yoga in the world 's biggest ground . I am talking about the whole world .
Discovery Channel has planned to publish this program in 165 countries .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate justice , clean environment in our country .
But one more interesting thing is that some are asking me something , Modi ji , tell me that you are talking in Hindi , Bear Grylls do not have Hindi .
Do n't do anything after this .
Then what happened to the cost of shooting .
It is questioned very carefully .
See , there is no secret in it .
There is a question in many minds. Okay, I tell this secret now.
Actually this is not secret .
In fact, technology has been fully utilized in the conference with Bear Grylls.
As soon as I say something, it used to happen in English and as a result Bear Grylls kept a small card level in the ears.
Therefore, if I talk in Hindi then it became easier because of listening to him in English, it is the miracle of technology.
After this show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to places like nature , wildlife , living places .
What is the nature
You will stay on seeing .
Your international is also large .
On 15th August, I made a request to you at least 15 places in the next three days, 15 places in India are completely tourist centres.
You go, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought is large .
My beloved countrymen , in India the thought of environment protection , care i . . conservation is seen naturally .
In the last month I was lucky to release the tiger population of the country .
Do you know how many tigers in India
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred sixty seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the corners .
In 2010 a tiger was established in St . Peters Burg in Russia about tigers .
In this information about reducing the number of tigers , one contribution has been taken .
2022 Kalla is the contribution of double the number of tigers of the world .
But now we will complete the goals of new India soon .
We double the number of tigers here in 2019 .
The number of tiger reserves not only in India but also the number of wild animals , community reserves has also increased .
I also recognized the Gir lions of Gujarat while releasing the tiger tax .
When I responsibilities there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was decreasing .
We have done a lot of things in Gir.
In 2007 we decided to make women guards there .
We have enhanced the economic amenities to increase the tourists.
When we talk about natural , wild animals then conservation is discussed .
But along with safety think about taking this church towards Karna .
Therefore it is not necessary to save forests , trees , wild animals , they should also give appropriate environment to increase properly .
My dear countrymen, how can we forget Swami Vivekananda's historical address in September 11, 1893
My beloved countrymen, you will remember that on 29th August we are celebrating the Jayanti Day.
In this context, we are starting the Fit India Movement across the country.
Keep yourself fit and make the country fit .
All their descriptions are now told .
Wear 29 August .
Besides this 02 October is completely plastic cosmetic .
To get rid of plastic we should stay with all the houses , houses , houses at all places .
I know about this thing that the dust in Soshil media .
Come , let us move ahead with a new alternative , new energy .
I'll wait for your words, for your information.
Come, let us all move ahead to realise the dreams of the freedom fighters, to realise Gandhi's dreams.
Mann Ki Bath - speaking in mind .
O my beloved country , worship .
January 26th Ganesha Festival is celebrated with so much enthusiasm throughout the country .
The State of India, the people of the country, the people of the country, and the democracy of the people of the country, is like a festival for our country's cultures in a way, which will further contribute to the responsibilities of our democracy.
But now the responsibilities of people in our country , how deep is the responsibility of the people of our country , how much has to be discussed that it is not so much .
To morrow 30 January is the pilgrimage of Bapuji .
On 30 January 30 o'clock in the morning we pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country .
It is a natural way in the society , country .
Both minutes also pay attention to simplicity , culture , martyrs .
A natural ornamentation of the army , security forces of our country is present .
This Ganesha day I am impressing all the members of their family members with various books in the morning .
In these books there are many types of Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , Parmar specific service , special service etc .
If we understand their virtue , adventurous activities properly then we also get inspiration with pride .
On 26 January 26 we were engraved in Kashmir during excitement , enthusiasm on one side .
I am trying to glorify the adventurous devotion of all these virtues .
My young friends , all of you know very well , I keep talking continuously in my mind .
January , February , March , April months are the time of examination in every family .
There is a test of both the children in the house , there is a chance of testing on everyone at home .
I asked the students , to talk with their teachers , this is the right time to talk with their teachers because I went somewhere , whose tests were seen big problems .
Families , students , students , everybody is seen to be mixed with a very unique psychological environment at home .
Seeing them I want to participate the thought that came in my mind .
I got a telephone message from creation.
Listen , what is the creation of creation , I want to tell you , during the tests , in our house , in our society there is a terrible environment in our society .
Because of this students are encouraged by the inspiration .
People enjoy happiness are beneficial .
Therefore the goal of my goal is like a festival .
On the occasion of festival , festival the best time comes out of us .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
What is the best alternative .
Festival removes the chances of testing .
Therefore I have told all the parents that you change all these three months with enthusiasm atmosphere .
Actually , from Kanyakumari to Kashmir , from Kutch to Kamrup , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh , these three - four months tests are done .
Therefore I am calling you ' Smile Mor , Scor Mor ' .
If you are stressed then all the doors are closed , the matter does not enter inside , the internal thing does not come out .
You have not even told anyone .
Inside why did we remember that you came out of the sword .
Therefore it is an important medicine to increase memory that it is relax .
Through my own experience I say that if we are tired then we forget our things but when relaxed then how many things are not able to work in the memory of us .
Therefore, A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes we feel that we are not able to see proper test .
It is not test of life .
How do you live , how do you want to live , how do you want to live
Apart from the tests given by Not Book in Clas Room many more tests are faced in your life therefore , the tests are related to the guides of life .
e.
The great example of Abdul Kalan is in front of our eyes .
He wanted to reach the airways .
Neither are they found .
Somebody had sent a question to me . ' In this time the very big luxury of seeing education is that electricity has become the center of examination .
That is why I want to know your thought about the future of education today .
There is a pocket in their question but they want to know my opinion as well .
Tell you , do you have a family doctor to show the whole family
You will see his experience , wisdom , how much profit he is .
Rucha Garu was also known as Pratispartha.
This is a big mental war .
Many adventurous games are the speciality of life that they competition with themselves .
Twenty years ago it was a unique life journey to go ahead after smiling itself .
Because he has choosed the way of support of support .
Friends, can you donate the time of studying peacefully in every corner of your life even when you go to the test for two hours
The couples were not able to get up at the time of decision that they were not able to get up at the time of decision .
Before examining the cost of the test it is not able to sleep , now it is not possible .
On its own it produces that energy inside .
If you want to say simple , if you are comparison with someone then three main storeys are seen .
What he had come that my mother did not read much .
But while sitting with me asked me to leave me .
Adopt that .
Use how much capacity you have , how much time you are in work .
If you learn to accept once , special problems will end there .
Problem is believed to be conserved in the roots of the problem .
Many times creative words - we were in the hospital with heart attack .
Then the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha of India Ganesh Dada Mavalar , his son , one time A . . Purushottam Mandalar , came to see in the hospital .
If we want to say that on meeting the person with unhealthy disease we fear them with the name of disease .
I am talking with carelessness , sometimes we also practice such a way with children .
If you want to give the situation of laughter to the child in the day of the test then do you feel that you are able to make the situation of laughter .
By doing this , the weather changes .
I got a pictured phone call.
And he spake not his name .
You will understand that why he can not tell his name .
Therefore I started making many attempts .
I tried to find its methods so that my time has become very old .
As long as it is time to see the burps , how much time has been old that I am ready to read properly , then the markets were gained .
Seeing how you see that it will swim towards the way to fail life .
If you are taken in the test then your life will be destroyed .
If you are not taken then the guilt of life will not be left in your mind .
If you have to tell your children then you can not talk to their eyes easily .
If you are also turning your paths into the nails, then I have seen that how many new methods are used in finding new methods , how much it is kept , it is expensive for the methods of seeing their complete creativity .
It is not necessary to see the same creativeness , on the same time it is not necessary to examine the matter .
The result is available with their own difficulty , therefore the self-confidence of increasing self confidence is unique .
Your gurus , your parents cut me .
Because students pay attention to sports , the meditation of studies decreases .
The thought of Asli is wrong .
It is also important for the rest of the body parts of the body .
Give at least five minutes break .
You will know that your work is easy .
It is not known for everyone but it is my experience .
In such a time taking deep breath is very beneficial .
There was no room to breath deeply .
After going to Mungit , Dababa for five minutes deep breath and sit to read again .
Some people start reading more at night but definitely give sleep to the body as much as possible .
Your concentration increases .
Freshness increases in you .
All your capacity increases properly .
When I participate in so many councils , sometimes my throat bloats .
Once a dynasty came to meet me .
If you are sleeping properly then you will get good relief for your voice .
I have never thought of my sleep , my progress Gurinchi , my throat .
But , young women , you are in an attempt to test , I have kept you in ' mind ' .
I think that my these things will definitely give you rest .
The ' security ' is the mantra of the Tirthankara ' .
The seventh Tirthankar team along with their responsibilities , our country has done the program to clean the sea shore .
Thousands of people participate in it .
In the Tirthankara team not only the women 's office , but also in the form of carelessness the Hovercraft Command is also organised .
Our seawater conservation in the Indian coast has also become a major part of the world, hence, many good wishes for the Indian Coast Guard to complete 40 years.
Prabruary is the only festival of Tarikh .
On the day of the year Panchami in our country the festival of Saraswati is celebrated .
The opportunity of electricity is considered to be the opportunity .

A few years ago, the people of Jammu and Kashmir came to meet me in large numbers.
He belonged to the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
He came from different villages in the Kashmir Valley.
There was a need to talk to them for a long time.
All these students from the Kashmir Valley have raised their words without any hesitation.
If the students of the board exams look at such a large number of hostels, it will provide an indication that our children in Jammu and Kashmir will be able to achieve a sustainable development through education for the future of their youth.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to their parents, their other family members, teachers and village teachers.
This time, all the beloved brothers and sisters of Son Ki Baat (Speech in Manas).
He said that Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 will be discussed in a big way.
I am launching a grand scheme to bring about a change in the country by talking to the people of the country for 8 hours on November 8.
I am very grateful to all of you that when you take this decision, this decision will not be simple and will be competing with difficulties.
I also said that this decision will take 50 days to overcome its impact, but we cannot move towards a simple situation.
We cannot afford to get rid of the 70-year-old situation.
I can fully understand your problems.
500, 1000 rupees, such a big country, such a huge currency on the other side, this determination is being ensured by the entire world.
Our country will undoubtedly address this issue with all the positive efforts.
The Union Government, State Governments, Local Institutions Yavat Instruments, lakhs of bank accounts, lakhs of jobs, lakhs of jobs, more than lakhs of post offices and more than lakhs of friends to Baikal have been engaged in this programme at night.
The distress that has been created is calmly considering this as the service of the nation and being considered as a great achievement.
This is the reason that India will be able to overcome this situation.
I have seen that all the banks and their departments work together in such a situation.
Excellencies in tests only provide real power estimation.
But the wickedness has become so strong that even these people do not have the habit of mischief.

Our villages and farms are the core pillars of our country's economy.
Trains are looking for routes among many hardships.
The government has also taken several important decisions in the direction of providing priority to farmers and villages.
Small businesses of our country are employed and economic activities are also taken forward.
Like the big malls, even small shops in villages can do their business for 24 hours and we have taken a major decision in the budget below which is to stop any law. Why shouldn't the smallest poor shopkeeper of the villages get the same opportunity while trading for 24 hours according to my belief
Several steps have been taken to provide relief to them through Mudra Yojana.
Millions and crores of rupees have been given as loans to such small businessmen through MUDRA Yojana because this small business is being done by the people in the form of crores.
In this context, I would like all our small businessmen to ask for a digital world.
You should also download the yaps of banks in your mobile phones.
I want you to do business on the basis of technology in the entire village.
Therefore, I specially want to share with all the socio-economic responsibilities in this function because I have taken such a big decision for the poor people of the country, for the farmers, for the workers, for the deprived and the oppressed.
I especially want to talk to young friends.

The Jan Dhan Yojana has a combined card of crores of poor families of India.
And the RuPay card usage before the 8th was very good and now the poor have been supplied with RuPay card.
Like a prepaid card in the mobile phone, a prepaid card is available in the bank as well.
This is as easy as you sent the messages to WattsApp.
A person who is not able to vote, send messages and forward on this day.
Besides, technology is so easy that there is no need for a big smartphone for this thing.
Our small commodity will also be reduced by the phone.
I am very well aware that you are participating in this important work.
But my dear young friends, I need your help in this thing.
Your mobile phone will have technology to use online access.
Moreover, how to use technology everyday for two hours and two hours, how to download your bank ypnotics
The shopkeepers should also be trained on how to do business through technology.
You must come forward to work towards the end of the country, for the welfare of the poor and the deprived section of the society, for the welfare of the people and for the welfare of the people.
You will get the blessings of the poor once learnt the method of using RuPay card.
Within a month, we will be able to stand as a new modern India of the world.
You can't do this through mobile phones and go to ten homes a day.
We have taken this war to the forefront of liberating the country from the ruthlessness of the country.

He transformed the spiritual opportunity of the nation into a festival of well-being through community welfare festivals.
A motivational mantra called Swatantra Mara Janma Hak has been telecast.
Now we are in independent India.
This time many people have sent me a lot of questions on issues like Ganesh Utsav, Durga Puja.
Their words have caused problems in the environment.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has expressed satisfaction that people should not use the requests made by the Plaster of Paris in Mann Ki Baat.
We cannot protect the environment, ponds and rivers by generating soil as our archaeological heritage.
Small germs and animals living in that water are destroyed by water pollution.
We are learning a little bit from ourselves through men and tribes.
There is no need for big studio and big cameras for this.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
Thanks to Bangladesh, who stood firm in this regard.
I also express my gratitude to the participants of Skywani Friends in foreign exchange.
I am grateful to the power of 125 crore people of my country.
Thank you all.
Today there is a chance of spending some moments with the youth of Delhi .
It is believed that in the days of coming we fill our youth with the enthusiasm of salt everybody in India .
Today, India has organised important programmes like 'Run for Reyo', 'Aadi Jeevan' and 'Development' in the city of Delhi.
In a way it is a difficult task .
How many desires are there about food they have to leave all the water .
The parents of their parents also have to give excitement from behind their children .
Nobody is not able to play at night .
I am also ready to do this work from your generation.
To give your ruins to our sports our sports your country is ready to work as the main minister of your country .
You send ruins by the name of the water of the players in Nrandra Modipe .
Your ruins give me the name of my name .
I am talking about Rio Olympic . . a favorite lover , Punjab University University has sent a poet .
Although the poets written in all languages possibly the poets written poets , writing them can be voluntary .
But in this contribution I want to keep this poet sent to me .
Yavat world has glorified the world .
But when we came to remember the name of Abdulla Kalanji then this painting of India appears in front of our eyes .
You can not take technology at a level .
If this research is not a new alternative then how does the water standing without flowing spread the pollution by increasing the pollution then the information also becomes heavy .
If we live with the help of old technology without research , then in this world we will go behind us in the changing age .
Therefore in the youth scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific research has taken many programs .
In our schools wherever these tinkering labs are monthly, apart from enjoying Rs.
If I talk about the Atal Incubation Centre then in the direction of giving ten crore rupees to India the government has also thought .
Devgarh is smitten with many other problems of India .
We see many problems with daily life .
These discoveries encourage the Government of India specially by encouragement .
Abdul Kalam is a true belief i . . research , innovation , technology for the treatment of our daily life problems , simple complications for the treatment of our problems , how much our youth works in 21st century .
It is my belief that Abdulla is the true belief of our offering to Riya .
To give help to the problems related to the central state governments the shoulders with shoulders without strength .
The more thunders , races are running that we do not even think about us once .
Not working for that patient , fighting with disease , making new reports , scientific researches , not spending many such diseases , in such a way that these diseases are not able to do new problems .
Therefore it is very important to be cautious in the matter of disease .
The microbes that spread the diseases of tuberculosis , malaria take changes in our body that there is no effect of medicine .
In the medical terminology it is called antibiotic resistance .
Therefore how to say antibiotics that it is necessary to participate those rules as well .
Our government has built our government to stop this antibiotic resistance .
But in the last teeth the number of mothers dieing at the time of childbirth decreased but in the pregnant mothers no one has to say that life is safe .
Keeping in mind these things from the last few months the Prime Minister started the name of Safe Maternity Abhiyan .
Basically this technique is organised free tests in the health centers of all women of 9th month every month .
Thousands of physicians coming forward after listening to me .
But our India is huge .
Lacs of doctors should be given by this technique .
The spitting in the country and abroad is being discussed about this .
In India ages are pressing this thing .
In Kurukshetra war also Lord Shri Krishna is proposed about trees .
In the festival of Mahabharata the discussion has been described about this .
It is said in the festival of Mahabharata that if any tree is planted then it becomes their form .
There is no doubt in it .
Through their seed they get the same benefit by the tree as well .
Therefore parents ignoring their imagination do not plant good trees . encourage them by their children .
I remembered one example of the girls of Pune for a few days .
It touched my mind .
In Pune of Maharashtra in the Talluka of Junnar in the Narayanpur village of Narayanpur Ratu had celebrated his marriage with a lot of support .
The pilgrimage has done that how much is the marriage of Sonal marriage , friends , guests , guests have given the plant of Kesar mango .
I was surprised when I saw that picture in the media .
In marriage there is no swinging of lips .
The view of the heart dam is in that picture .
Sonal agricultural scientists have come to himself .
Many people use such uses .
I remember that when I was the chief minister of Gujarat then travellers used to come in large numbers in the temple of Ambaji there .
It is said that by giving a plant to the visitors of the temples by giving a plant to the darshan of this plant . Take it carefully , if you are grown in your house then you will get the blessings of the girls .
Although lakhs of people were sent to this seven lakh plants .
Temples can also start the tradition of giving plants instead of Prasad in this seventh rainy season .
This day we have to get down from foreign countries to build houses , to make houses in our country , to make houses worth crores of rupees .
If we plant trees on our fields then the trees giving mixture to the house , furniture to work , then after 15-20 years the government can sell them with the permission of the government .
The central government has also empowered the treasury and provided the state governments for plantation of more than 40 thousand crore rupees under this Act.
I know that the government of Maharashtra government had started a proposal of planting three crores of plants on the 1th day of July .
The desert area of Rajasthan . how heavy weight started in that state , old lacs of plants were planted .
It is not a common thing to keep nutritious trees in Rajasthan .
The state of Rajasthan is understood to know about the situation of the earth , how much it is adventurous .
In Andhra Pradesh also the expansive expansion of 2019 forests has been decided to increase 50 percent .
Under the Green India Mission running the Central Government this work has been done .
There is also a great tradition of Nama Mahotsav in Gujarat .
But the tourism of South Africa is like a pilgrimage .
It is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela as soon as the head of South Africa .
Their faces of Gandhi , Mandela appear in front of our eyes as soon as the voices of Ahins , love , forgiveness .
I went to the Finex Centre in the contribution of my South Africa tourism . Mahatma Gandhi 's residence is famous by the name of Sarvodaya .
The most friends of Nelson Mandela , Shri Ahmad Kathrada , Shrilalu Chiba , Shrijarj Bijos , Shrironi Kasarials have the privilege of visiting all these great personalities .
Our children want good future .
I am hungry for the craftmanship . I sent a message to me .
It is believed that a woman is deceived that she is not able to bear the pain of 11 lakh rupees .
Because of being a woman I was afflicted with her family .
Tell your opinion about such deceived i . . .
Such matters can also be seen in your eyes as to how much information is available in our mobile phones and in our mobile phones, behold, you have received so much reward.
You can also deceive at times .
Making some authority leather pad is sent to Mary .
Your credit card is made available on November, Debit card.
How good thing of craftmanship has been brought in my sight . You can not take anything like this , you can not take more , but I feel that my beloved countrymen .
Nowadays parlor is being conducted . I get the opportunity to meet many people of the country in the context of parlor .
Our parliamentarians also bring people from their respective places to me.
Some students came to me from Aligarh .
Watch the enthusiasm of smoking in girls .
He showed me photographs . He made Aligarh railway station beautiful .
Artificial paintings have been put on the station .
The station has given a new form of a new form by making this virtual garden in plastic seats towards the railway station .
If you also go to Aligarh then definitely see this station .
It is said that the local people are exhibiting their identity through their arts on the walls of railway stations.
All those who do such work in the country are particularly optimistic of all the Namitras of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, festivals of our country also start.
Raksha Bandhan festival is a special festival with us .
As soon as Christian year this seventh year also you can not give the prime minister of the girls of our country , sisters of our country , safe Bima John or Jyothi Bima John .
This is the right meaning of safety binding .
Although I am the first prime minister of independent India .
Like Deepavali all of us need a festival and you also do something good with the patriotism of the country .
You can see that these thoughts are mainly heard from the Red Fort .
Tell me these words , and these thoughts , that I may hear from the Red Fort , which I have heard from the Red Fort , the chief minister of this country , chief servant of this country .
I got the opportunity to discover words in my mind once more .
In my view, Mann Ki Baat (the word in mind) is not a religion.
How excited I am talking with you .
I am really grateful to all of you in the core of the country through the programme of Mann Ki Baat everywhere in India.
I express my gratitude to the skies for successfully praising this Mann Ki Baat programme in the Akashwani language at 8 o'clock in the night.
I hope that in seeing working with the meditation of our democracy you will participate even more active , enthusiasm .
The heat of summer is increasing daily .
In such a situation the ruins of ruins have increased the dream of rubber coming for a week .
Approximately all the country has stuck in the effect of strong sunshine .
Temperature keeps increasing rapidly .
Animals, birds, or humans.
Every animal is feeling pain .
Due to the reason of unconsciousness of tourists these problems become poisonous .
By cutting the trees carelessly the vegetation of the forest becomes stiff .
If you want to say a way , by swimming the nature by swimming it .
This time, the state of ICT has envisaged a Gero Tolerance for Elligerent Wildlife Trade on the occasion of World Environment Day.
If this is the tradition of the previous government, I would like to organize a joint meeting with all the Chief Ministers of the underprivileged States, but I would not do this.
I was departed from every state and spent about two and a half hours in one state.
I listened carefully to every state.
As a matter of fact, the Union Government has enforced the number of such cases as the states, and the amount of money that every state has spent.
The Union Government officials were surprised to know that some states have made remarkable efforts to meet water, environment and defect, and to take care of the afflicted human beings.
I asked them how to exercise righteousness in entering the best practices of all the states.
Some states, particularly Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have fully utilized technology.
I would like to recognise the immensely successful efforts made by these states in the future by righteousness and by other states.
The peoples participation stands as a strong foundation for such meetings.
We pray five times while pursuing God's forgiveness along with it.
Water is also Goddess Prasad .
Therefore, water harvesting, utilisation of fertilizer water, all these can also be given priority.
By adopting a micro-subordinate approach, it is necessary to utilize more crops with every drop of water by supplementing the solid water.
Our captured trains in many states are ensuring the supply of micro-irrigated water, and many more are playing the role of water supply.
The objective is to bring about two-three hectares of land to micro-irrigated water bodies every year.
Our Telangana brothers are trying to utilize the water of the rivers of Krishna and Godavari through Mission Bhagirathi.
Water-Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh
Chhattisgarh's Lok Suraj-Jal Suraj.
Efforts are being made to revive them as water gods in the oldest states of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched the Swavalamban Yojana in Rajasthan.
Whether it is Jharkhand Forest Area or some places there is water load.
This is a matter of concern for the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the farmers, the villagers.
It is a matter of joy that how much water can be supplied when the Deepawali connection is celebrated this time, how much water can be stopped without wasting.
There will be no limit to our joy.
The more powerful the water is, the more we get tired, the more we swallow up the water, the more we get fresh.
Well fainted, when I saw a big pond.
We cannot save that property by putting a cosmetic mind.
We will increase the water supply.
Increase water .
We will bring the waste water back to use.
I would like to press this matter to you.
Don't leave the coming time old.
We will convert the four-month-looking water into a 'Jal Bachao Abhiyan'.
It's not mantras.
This is the responsibility of all of us, the media and the media have developed a wide range of water exploration in the past.
They also want to guide people towards water conservation, workforce and water conservation.
I also welcome those mediums.
We must change our old habits slightly.
If you help me in that matter, then we can achieve our development in that direction.
There were no coins, no mouths.
If you want salt, give vegetables.
The world is running towards a non-communicable environment.
Through electronic technology, we can take and deliver doubles.
There is no fear of passing the pockets.
Automatic numbers are there.
This will be difficult in the first place.
But if there is a gradually a habit then this system becomes simple.
About all the families of the country have opened their accounts in the Bangkok on the occasion of 'Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana'.
In the coming days, this card will be credited and debited in two ways.
There is no need to remove and count the pockets from the pocket.
I don't want to deceive the dubb.
The second step we have launched will transform the Bank on Mobile - Universal Payment Interface Banking Transactions (UPI) approach.
Mobile phones will make it easier to train.
If this happens then you will not have to do the same thing with you.
About 1.
25 lakh banking concessions are being provided to the youngsters.
But it will be as soon as it happens.
How's the dinner
When the sportsperson knows that 125 crore people are with him, this enthusiasm will be reflected.
If we don't get the desired results, life will not stop there.
Live with self-confidence, move forward with self-confidence.
But I have come forward with a new issue and I have never thought of it.
My best.
If there is an e-mail in the in-set, my vision has gone towards it.
He had put forward his meeting as Gurudev Patel of the middle country.
It seems to be a burden on my mind and he was sent away.
You had to go ahead with a lot of development.
I wish all of you that when your children bring the results of the tests at home, confess them in a fashionable manner.
Encouraging them to further develop, otherwise, they have brought an hundred for hundred.
If something else is done then it will be better even on that day
I don't know the situation around me.
These points are not properly recognised.
But I have painted that life is a sympathetic element.
When the picture was kept in view, it was suggested that if the glimpse of it was blue, the color of the blue would have been better if those glasses were not brick and brick then it would have been better.
I don't want to understand the painting, but more than those who say that it should be lightened.
However, if we are not happy to see the results, we can never make new constructions.
Sanskrit is happy, it is very much possible to achieve it.
It keeps on fighting in life.
You must have heard about music on the occasion.
It was once used in the conscious music in the Kashmir Valley.
Cleanliness is the biggest weapon to prevent diseases.
Cleanliness can benefit the poor.
The second weapon is that I am talking about Yoga every time.
Teeth is called yoga .
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
Full of meetings, Yoga provides the power to live a happy life.
June 21st is Yoga Day, not a programme.
We need inspiration from June 21 to transform our lives.
Each time the social environment will bring about a change in human life.
You will be a participant on June 21.
Can we not use June 21 to make Yoga a part of our lives
This time I will go to Chandigarh for the work to be done.
On June 21, I will be meeting the people of Chandigarh for a thousand years.
On that day, you will also be giving Yoga to everyone around the world.
And Sarnah , and Sarnah ,
Thanks again.
Goodbye
Now the summer time.
Everyone plans for summer holidays.
This is also the time of mango fruits and we want to taste these fruits.
It seems as if we take a little afternoon once in the afternoon .
But this year the entertainment of everyone has destroyed the entertainment of sunshine .
How natural is the species about heat .
Since last two years due to the emergence of fortification , the effect of resistance has been seen on the places standing in our water .
Several times due to the cabbage, due to sand dumping several times, water flow in reservoirs and other reservoirs has been blocked.
As a result , reservoirs can keep water less than their capacity .
To discover the problem of famine , governments try to give relief from water conservation .
But this is not one .
To meet the situation, the citizens are eager to work hard.
Chaitanya is now in many villages.
Those who experience the deficiency of water they can know the price of water .
He said that the rural water scarcity in Panchayati village of Hive Rebazar village in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra has been tackled as a major and delicate problem.
Anyone can see the villages who are optimistic about water harvesting.
The issue was resolved by the traders in the HIV Rebursement by changing the sowing of fruits.
That is, they have decided to shun prisons and bananas.
It is very easy to hear, but in reality it is not that easy.
Is this a big decision
Anybody can imagine the responsibilities of using such water for the masters of the Karmagaras who are more immune to their units by shutting them down.
But look at the scientific scientific scientific science of this rail brother .
He said that there is no need to boil water to the prisoner so that he should not pour out the crop.
Apart from captivity the fruits like fruits , vegetables are being used in less water .
He undertook several such programmes such as sprinklers, drop medals, water horticulture, water recharge, etc.
I can talk about a small town like Hive Rebazar but there are many more such villages.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the inhabitants of such villages for their good work.
I am told that Gorwa village will be Panchayati in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
Approximately 27 ponds have been constructed.
Approximately 20 percent of their income has increased.
When the water level rises then there is a lot of change in water conservation.
Clean drinking water also causes GDP growth.
But many people around us are trying to meet the negative vision of how new methods are being developed for the future.
Why shouldn't we take the soil out of the pond this time and put it in the field
The field also grows very well and the power to accumulate water for the field also increases.
Sometimes it can be stopped in cement bags, sometimes in empty bags of red bottles, filling soil and stopping them in the ways of waste water.
He was addressing the gathering at MyGov, Shri Kumar Krishna, here today.
We can never succeed in this thing without the participation of the people.
Therefore, everybody will be a messenger to bring about a change for cleanliness and hygiene.
This is what we have to say and decide.
We also contribute to social institutions and voluntary institutions.
We have taken several steps to prevent hygiene and industrial pollution.
Everyday, there will be a lot of garbage in the Ganges through the canals.
To clean such a waste, the waste is being removed from Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna.
All local institutions have been asked to clean the waste at places.
When this cleanliness drive takes place, it has been found that 11 tons of garbage has come out of 3 tons a day.
Pollution coming from paperwork has almost stopped.
We are moving ahead in the right direction.
Kewal is not on the bank of the Ganges.
It is very rare to have so many programmes in such villages of the country for ten days.
For the betterment of the villages, for the development of villages and for the welfare of the people, several initiatives have been changed in this context.
Whatever Chaitanya comes in the villages.
Therefore, if the entire village is depriving the people of the country then we will get the desired results.
Sharmila Dharpure from Mumbai - she made a call from her phone.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today.
Namaskar.
I am talking about Sharmila Dharpur from Mumbai.
Sharmaji, your movement is very helpful.
Now if the parents have a dream in every family then it will be better to adopt the children.
If something comes to you, go to yourself and talk to the teachers.
This blockade can reduce the shortage of our education system.
Technology plays a very big role in education.
Some people keep coming to me on the NarendraModiApp.
I'm talking to Mona Karnawal from Beij Noor.
They should also have the feeling of tea and spirit and also the qualities of good quality.
Your stress, all your suggestions, all these are the fact that NCC, NSS, India Scoots and Guides, Red Cross representatives and Nehru Yuva Kendras had organised a meeting.
When asked about such a meeting, he said that this is the first time that such a meeting will be held in the country's independence.
They are doing a lot in their ways.
However, if we conclude our various programmes in the community sector, we can see the greatest success.
There is inspiration and a national philosophy will grow.
I got that benefit in childhood.
I also call for a new life in these institutions.
This time I kept something before them.
How many districts, how many districts can we eliminate external excesses.
I am a request to all of you.
Please inform the alternatives of this youth institution .
Do we celebrate any newness in their work and their programmes
If you come to me on my NarendraModiApp, I'll send them to the right place.
I believe that after this meeting they can provide a new momentum.
You also want to meet them.
Crore will be spent on these committees.
But the matter was where it was.
This is the feeling of everybody.
Nobody thinks it .
Today , my beloved country residents , in this matter I am very happy to keep my own thing before you .
The families of a fort have voluntarily surrendered their gas subsidy.
The family members of this fort are not related.
How easy is it to leave sabsidy above .
Mobile phones can be made by yp.
You can also release a subsidy by giving a missed call to television number.
I extend my best wishes to the families of this fort.
This is one thing that the economic scientists of our country are also thinking differently.
We should move forward in this direction.
I have one more thing to say that why should I intervene in the 3rd class and 4th post office
Sometimes I feel one more thing and I would like to say that in some ways somebody will have his ticket.
Once upon a time, there are unforgettable results.
Well, these are my thoughts in my mind and cannot be transformed into government rules.
However, such people can imagine the possible environment.
Please ask your officers to post a good event every day, he added.
Breaking News in every newspaper and TV channel are all bad news.
Whether it is a good thing for us to have surroundings in this country with a population of 125 crore people.
Change this situation.
Ravi Ganesha has wrought his anger but his wrath is not against me.
You will remember that our former state doctor A.
P.
Abdul Kalam used to say, "Please offer a good news to the media for the first time.
These days some T . . .
When a candle is lighted then darkness is removed and it is removed .
The Government has enabled a website called Hansiting Corps.
To do something positive, to talk positively, to bring positive things to the fore, we have to join hands.
A lot of people in the world know that crores of people reach the bank of a river and take bath in the morning.
In the last few days, I have spent several people uploading the Kumbh Mela photographs.
I believe that tourism institutions of the Central and State Governments should create a chemical competition.
The Kumbh Mela is a traditional and spiritual festival.
I will certainly meet you all this evening in a special context like the Panchayati Raj Diwas.
This is my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Likewise, I am extremely delighted to share the thoughts of your mind and the thoughts of my mind.
Man Ki Bath , July 2019 .
Just like Mann Ki Baat, I am looking forward to you too.
People in large numbers shared their descriptions on a variety of books.
People are discussing books on many subjects like science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and life history.
Sometimes I got the opportunity to talk about other books.
And I will talk to you about many more books without it.
However, I am convinced that now we cannot afford to afford more books.
However, it has been a benefit that if you look at the details that are being sent by you then I have the opportunity to know a lot of books.
This month's experience seemed to be necessary to take it forward.
Why shouldn't we put a standard bookcarner in this NarendraModi App to use new books, write and chart
You can give a good name to this bookscarner.
We will make this as an activity for the readers and the writers.
You keep reading, writing and keep sharing with the help of Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to express my gratitude to the Government of India for encouraging farmers and encouraging them to sufficient water requirements instead of their traditional business practices.

But don't forget to participate in the quiz.
Most of us are inspired to participate.
My beloved countrymen, you must have imagined one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat has moved ahead after asking all the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
And all the efforts being made for cleanliness have been inspired by Mann Ki Baat.
The five-pronged journey will reach a new milestone of Swachhta in collaboration with all the people.
We will not be able to achieve this in terms of cleanliness, but as it is from ODF, as it is the collective strength of 130 crore countrymen, who have achieved the goal of Swachh Bharat Mission in public places.
But we don't stop here.
This scheme will be transformed from cleanliness to cleanliness.

We also feel this in the beauty of Swachhta Park.
Mahmood Aslam Bhai of Shopia, Jammu and Kashmir.

I know that more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in Uttarakhand this time since the start of the Chardham Yatra.
After the horrific disaster in 2013, pilgrims arrived in such record numbers for the first time.
My request to all of you is that you should not go to those places where there is a beauty in the country during the rainy season.
To see these beauty in our country, there is no greater teacher than the tourism journey to know the spirit of the people of our country.
There is a lot of hard work in other parts of the country.

In 1951 , in 1962 the Indian football hair of Indian football had spent gold in the Asian Gams , and in 1956 Olympic Gams the hair of India standing at fourth place .
From the point of view of itching we slipped some decades from there .
I don't even want to talk about how much our ranking in the FIFA is less.
On the other hand, I am going to increase the number of football belts in the youth of India and it should be English Premiere Leg or Leg or Indian Super Leg Match.
Indian youth are giving time to know about these matches, to see them in television.
I have said that when this game is growing so much, we will not only fulfil our responsibility when we get the opportunity to host the FIFA-17 World Cup.
Or do we encourage sports by using this opportunity to benefit us
Football, football, football should be created throughout this year - in schools, art galleries, in every corner of India.
In our youth , children wet with sweat by playing football .
It has been done that we get a simple massage to give guests .
Therefore , we try to take the beauty of the beauty of the village , street .
From today onwards, the FIFA under-17 World Cup in 2017 has been a step in the youth.
It is good to give guests to this program that many cultivations are done here .
If we are able to make every youth of our country with this game .
How can we enhance the spirit of Indias youth through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup
How to give comparison to this sports in government , educational institutions , social institutions .
We are watching all this in cricket
These parlors also try to present other games .
I believe that there is a need to recognise the ability of the youth of India that is not in the sense of any match or ship.
2017 Affordable-17 World Cup is ready for the economy and we can exhibit it by combining our strengths.
In doing so, we can also do the branding of India's talent.
You can send your suggestions and suggestions on the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup to me through the NarendraModiApp
How to songs , songs
What should be the cost of sweets .
Think about friends .
Each young man must give an angel of the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup.
You should participate a big height in this program .
This is a golden opportunity to make India venerable.
If you want to go anywhere in my favorite students , holidays .
There are very few people going to foreign countries .
We should take this task further .
This time also do this work .
Nobody said that the journey is like a bird without wings .
To see you are really interesting , you should also prepare the international point of view of seeing them .
Travelling life plays a powerful role .
Now the journey in the youth of India is increasing , gymnasium .
In the days before they did not go on the way to go everybody , on the way ready .
They want to do something new
If we see the pictures of the past workers there , then how would it be more .
But the tourism of this coal has shown the list of Western Coal filds Limited .
Near the Sawaner village near Nagpur the Eco French Mine Tourism Centre has been described on 10,000 people till now .
If you want to see something new then this is our opportunity .
This time when you go to roam around the holidays then what can you do for cleanliness .
In scientific method this attempt is not possible but the work is done .
But if we want to lose the tourism of 125 crore people of the country then we can attract the world .
We can make a big part of the world tourism .
Otherwise our crores can show the chances of the youth .
Government Gony , institution Gony , society , people make it a work of making it adventurous .
Come , let us make an attempt in this direction .
Beloved my young friends , holidays I do not like to make some vain in the city .
If you are not able to swim , then you can learn this swimming in holidays .
If the cycle is not able to take the decision of cycle in holidays .
Nowadays if you are tying on computer with only two fingers then why do not I learn typing in the right way
There are many types of experts for the development of our personality .
Why should not you learn them
Now take a thought .
In these you need a lot of clubs , trainer , very big figures , big budgets .
You see around you.
You must use your holidays for the development of your personality , for the development of your personality , to glimpse your experts .
This child remembered me the thing that I had told me .
That child told me about a good work by photographing me .
He told me that he was doing this work as much as one year . Many birds had become his friends .
How much love is the birds of Mahadevi Varma in Hindi language .
Come , let us also do as Mahadev Varma had said .
I am conveying my best wishes to me for a special thing.
The craftmanship of Mysore has brought us a problem of so much favourable .
Beloved my Ratu brother brother brother brotherhood . Digital India has heard many times .
Digital India meaning this is related to youths in cities , which can see their world .
It is not true .
You will be happy to know that Kisan Suvidha App is available for your convenience.

The baton situated in it speaks to you directly with the scientists , agricultural experts .
If you ask some questions then they give soap .
You will tell you .
My Ratu brothers , brothers , sisters think that this Kisan is done on their mobile phones .
Try to see once . What is your work in it .
There is no deficiency in it , there is less information that you can also make me fierce .
Rain waits for rain .
But if there is no water then what happens then all our countrymen also think .
During this time we stop flowing water in our pond , water flowing places , ponds , ponds reaching there , or due to the formation of trachoma the water flowing there stops .
In the past after cleaning the water places , places , places again and again we can prepare water to reach the water even more by cleaning the garbage .
Fill the pond full of our rivers , canals , if rains are not visible after that then the deficiency of water does not cause much harm to us .
But it is possible to stand by holding the leaf of water every vehicle .
This time we were able to excavate five lakh water .
Although in this direction how much attempt is needed to take place .
Beloved my Ratu brother , brotherhood . Italy Government of India has played a heavy rail .
Everybody should be in balance .
That is why the expenses are left less money .
And our resolution is that the excessive reduction in the expense is higher and higher.
This very mantra should be celebrated , we should increase in scientific methods in our agriculture .
This year, this year, the entire world has organised the programme with the help of Beat Diabetes.
It is estimated that approximately six and a half crore patients of diabetes in our country .
Three percent deaths become the cause of diabetes .
Two types of typ-1 , typ-2 in diabetes .
Type-1 dynasty comes .
Our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes .
Physiotherapy decreases .
There is no sweat .
We can do anything in our personal life to smite diabetes from 7th April .
If you are interesting then do yoga .
Or at least walk or race procedure .
If everybody is healthy in India then my country is also healthy .
March is celebrated on 24th day of the world tuberculosis .
On hearing the name of TB at my little time they were afraid .
It seemed as if the death was near .
But now there is no fear of TB because now everyone knows that the treatment of TB is possible .
On the top of the disease i . . nearby people , neighbours are also identified .
There are 13 thousand 500 microscope centres in our country .
This test is also done free .
Get a check up done once .
This disease stops .
If you have to do proper treatment , treatment till the complete healing of the disease .
There are some main contributions in the month of April . specially April 14 Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Jayanti .
His 125th Jayanti was done all the year .
His birthplace in Mahav, his education in London, his Diksha in Nagpur, 26, Alipur Road in Delhi, his last works were done in Mumbai.
We are continuously trying to develop in these Panch Tirthankaras .
I have the privilege of visiting his healthy Mahav on 14th April.
Baba Saheb has inspired us to become an excellent Pauri .
By changing a good Pauri on his way we can glorify faith in his glorious way .
In some days the new year of Vikram Sanctuary starts .
It is celebrated in different states in different forms .
You can hear in your mobile phone .
For this one has to call only a missed.
This service started only for months but 35 lakh people used it .
You also come to November .
I am so happy with you that I am so happy .
I would like to know from you what your best wishes are in 2017 that we can use the FIFA under-17 World Cup for our profits.
How to do this program .
The FIFA programme provides a unique opportunity to do this.
They have made photographs of such grand places that seeing them really enjoys how much .
I consider it a good signal .
Wherever there is no leg , like to bear feet there .
This contribution is considered to be a special impression of India .
In comparison to the countries of the world India tourism is very backward .
You also look like this .
You tell me a thing to think .
Look - you will be happy.
I am expecting you to tell this thing again in Mann Ki Baat.
The truth is that I forgot its identity .
You have spent this thing with me .
In taking any church for the preservation of water we should take these churches with complete cleanliness .
Many other diseases of our body are entered into our body only .
You must think about this thing .
Tuberculosis is called to be tested .
It is said that he had come to TB .
Its meaning is that this disease can also be tested very fast .
But if you do not think that this work is not because of the government , doctors , medicines therefore the residents of the country are my support .
Therefore , in your mind also the same stairs are kept .
I also want to meet with you in this journey .
As much as you have in the matter of tests of your children , it is the same .
But if we change our thought method according to the tests , perhaps we are free from this campaign .
I have said this in Mann Ki Baat that your experiences and suggestions must not be sent through NarendraModiApp.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers in my Mann Ki Baat.
I know that tests start in a few days .
Everybody asks how is ready for tests .
How many times come , how much scorpion I am talking .
You decide yourself for yourself .
While playing cricket they were estimating many estimations on me , how much hoped from me .
The estimation of the time was even more named .
Then how important I needed to discover this .
I decided my goals by myself , I am able to do something good for the country .
I was constantly trying to fulfil those goals .
The central decoration of my sight is quietly fulfilled .
Good luck.
Make your future only .
It is believed that these words of sunscreen are definitely useful for you .
Why should we not keep our memory with us
We reached somewhere , how far .
Do not get stuck in the number of numbers .
One of the highest goals of life should be decided and travel with a dream.
Therefore if you choose a large , high dream then the tests which changes into a fun year .
In them there is a healthy mind in the healthy body , how important is the word of Gupta .
If we talk about 365 days, our daily church should be suitable for our dreams and resolves.
The information done specially is that you sleep regularly , waking up early in the morning , we should do it .
Taking the entry centres of test centres , other things should be reached before the time of determination .
Do not do this .
I believe that you do not do this .
However , the foundation of success in life is responsible for keeping the stone nutritious .
A strong foundation takes place by regular symptom .
They are unsuccessful , they do the work of glorifying in the morning , they do the work of glorifying in the afternoon , how much the work to be done after smoking at night .
Not only this , our daily routine is also very important .
Therefore we should not see anything small .
Definitely , see .
O friends .
Sometimes I saw that two types of water is seen in the students going to the tests .
Who can say this thing very well - Champion Vishwanathan enjoys the Championship of Champions who have played the role of players in the world.
He participates his experiences with you .
Come , let us learn how to build these tests by him .
Hello, I enjoy Vishwanathan.
How I am ready for my tests , what is my experience now .
These tests have been seen beforehand in life .
Therefore if you are calm , eating nutritious food , sleeping straight , then your brain can remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute it is very important for you to see that you have not been able to remember properly once again .
The joy of Vishwanath is really important .
How much he sits in the international chadrang competitions , how much concentration you will be able to discover .
Is not the Arjun standing on the eyes of the bird
If you are standing on the banks of a pond then you will find many things in water below .
First of all the cost of the cost of the cost is seen after putting a stone .
If water is melted , then things are also seen in it .
It takes 30,40,50 seconds but once my mind is ready to understand things .
This can be my experience , it is also useful for you .
Rajat Agarwal is a good thing .
He wrote in my App - we will talk peacefully with friends and family members at least half an hour every day.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then wear things .
Ranchi Manas is in an effort to reach out to the entire world, within the country and outside the country by extending its exposure to the present situation.
Such worshipped Murari Bapu had sent an important chicken for the students .
He is also a teacher , counseller , therefore both of his words are included .
In your test if you move ahead with peace without any pressure then you will surely be successful .
It is also pride to be successful .
I will give my message and good wishes by telling a poet: there is no law for every one to be thankful.
Learn to live contact with virus also .
Our Hon'ble Prime Minister, Mr. Mann Ki Baat, is considered to be invaluable.
I also thank him for giving a very good message to all of us .
This is a matter of how happy me .
All this has come to the birth of gymnasty . It seems very good for me .
I want to say this now, start doing yoga from tomorrow's dawn - it will be unfair to you.
It is very light .
Definitely pay attention to it .
Look, maybe you can do them.
Why do all these things get alright
Read these information according to your precaution . two minutes , three minutes , five minutes .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question feels difficult .
Therefore tests .
Do not sleep , work without bending your strength .
And I said unto all my young friends , This is the same .
At the same time, remember one thing - there are plenty of opportunities in this country.
Decid what you want to do in life , do not take forever .
You're gonna win.
Don't forget that you're this universal mother.
You also have the right to stay here on the other side of the trees and mountains.
You have to take Kandarla , unconscious emotion , meditation .
By these symptoms you will be excited in all the tests .
You want to do victory in every matter .
The goddess blessed you .
Seeing , how is a great scientist speaking
To say that I take half an hour , that thing is told in three minutes .
This is the strength of scientific science . This is the strength of the scientists living in the mind .
I am telling thanks to the children of the country for giving support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then the fear will also be afraid .
The future of gold is waiting for you to do good .
Now I have tasted a message from taste on my App - a taste of the experience of my tests.
It is said that during the test the members of his family members keep trying to remain a social environment , this is the same kind of exercise is also done in their families .
Sometimes there is a lot of words , do not think that the boulders that inspire us do not inspire students only .
All of us read about Thamas Alva AIDS about our school .
Lights are also filled in our life .
The cost of victory is also hidden in the virus . Shrinivas Ramajan meaning who knows .
You will know that there is no traditional education in the past .
Raling . Harry Port Siris has changed the whole world .
Tests are not only one of the students , whole family , school , teachers .
But the situation of alone student is not good without parents , teachers .
Vijay Jindal was written on the children that they should not bear their weight .
Today parents do not want to say much .
Please do not fall in tension .
If someone talks to a friend - do not worry .
Why do I say that , friends , today national science day .
The science festival of the country is participating on 28 February 28 national science day .
28 February 1928 - Sir C.

Today the national science destination has strengthened the futures of the country .
Science , science , technology , all these are natural part in our development journey .
Moreover, this time the National Science Day initiative is Make in India.

But I want to tell this thing again to all the people of the country .
The main scientist of last century along with adopting this research the principle of ice stem cell has also been recognized in physiotherapy .
It is the opportunity to profit all the species of human species .
In this research procedure the kiss of our country , our meditation scientists also participate in it , their partner is the joy of all of us .
I wish to convey my heartfelt condolences to all those scientists
In future also our scientists have to buy this research in future .

This is the ability to call us forward.
Therefore, it is very comfortable to commemorate Dilip Sinha in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the occasion of Yoga Day. This is also an attraction for our country.
The mantra of Swachhta is transformed into every house.
This was not done in a big way in the media.
But I believe that the media reaches such villages where the light is spreading to the country.
It is extremely beneficial that the government employees in this electricity supply system will get a lot of happiness and satisfaction.
We all have to work together on good things, good things, good things and good things for common man.
This is also a service work.
But you are saying that I too should do it.
Everyone will load his mobile phone on Narendra Modi Yap down and join hands with me.
I would like to share some small things in this Yap.
It is a matter of joy for me to talk to the people through this yap.
You should also be a part of this effort in your own way.
How can I reach out to the crores of Indians without your help
Come, let us all imbibe the common mans language and inspire them to fulfil their dreams.
Can we start new start-ups, innovative and diverse start-ups as an excellent opportunity for our youth among our states
The world has not moved ahead without new innovations and creativity.
Start-up India Stand-up India has brought a great opportunity to the youth.
My young friends, the Government of India has brought the State of India - Stand up India to the full level of functioning.
We have a feeling that the digital world is a start-up representative only for IT profession.
That's what I think.
India has the original youth in the country.
On the 16th of January, I will come before you and talk about it in abundance.
Your suggestions are always welcome.

A teacher from Ahmedabad and Gujarat, Dilip Chauhan.
Sir, we have celebrated the Yaxebul India Festival in our school.
Dilip ji, I thank you.
Once called handicapped, or called disabled - Specially a wounded person - many such cases are being heard.
We know that money is also important.
Why shouldn't we use 'dividuals' instead of 'dividuals' in our country
They are one or more persons full of divinity.
We need creative artifacts to facilitate all these in schools, hospitals, government works, bus stands, railway stations, ropes, parking, lifting and brailley lipids, technologies and arrangements - a delicate and harmonious philosophy.
They should not be left dead and survivors in files.
Schemes are for the common man, for the poor.
There is no way to know or not in the present times.
The government has brought some changes in it.
Opening of Jan Dhan account - Aadhaar card - with the help of this, the largest river bank in the world has reached subsidies directly to the creditors through Direct Benefit Transfer.
Similarly, I am glad that the Ginny's Book of World Records has been placed in the Ginny's Book of World Records under the flagship scheme of the world.
This scheme, called Pehl, has been implemented very successfully.
On the one hand, opening of Jan Dhan Khata on the other, sharing of the Aadhaar card scheme on the other, sharing of it with Khata, on the other hand, sharing of the third State and Central Government on the basis of the collection of beneficiaries.
The National Rural Sub-Grameen has been included in the HamiPadhak villages.
Now about 40 thousand crore rupees have been transferred directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through various schemes.
I am guessing that 35 to 40 schemes are being implemented directly by Nagda Badili.
The 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar is a good coincidence.
In the Parliament also, a two-day discussion was held on the state.

On the other hand arrangements for Christmas Festival are also being started.
Festivals are very important for us in social life.
Once the festival is used to eliminate our wounds, it gives us a new strength.
Our country has immense vision, immense vision and immense hard work within a few days.
Moreover, in Tamil Nadu, the impact of these years has also been on other states.
But now the seeds have changed.

How will it benefit from eating cattle, this will also improve our land.
There will be two such benefits on the ground.
There is a need to talk to the farmers once.
They told me about a good experience.
And when we did the banana, the banana boats were left out.

Because that link is from News.
There is a woman named Nur Jahan of Kanpur.
She cannot be very well seen in the TV.
But nobody would have thought of her doing so.
Using solar energy, it provides light to the poor.
It is fighting on darkness.
She will be taken to Lanter in the evening.
I have heard that about 500 households at a very high altitude will come to her cough and they will take their laundry.
But the whole house is light .
However, this Noor Jahan will be able to recharge lotters with solar power throughout the day.
I also appreciate the JTV because this transformation in Kanpur has shown the entire world to the entire world.

The Prime Minister's Mudra Yojana is a tribute to those who do not have access to Yoga.
MUDRA encourages entrepreneurship.
Monetary Production is expected.
MUDRA actually empowers.
The Mudra Yojana is aimed at ease of doing business for small businesses.
The faster the water is flowing, the faster it is required to be achieved.
But the beginning was done well.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have been given Rs. 42 thousand crore from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Abhishek also spoke about his enthusiasm.
There is a lot of news for me too.
He said that Shailesh Bhonsle is the only person in Mumbai.
The Prime Minister said that Swachh Abhiyan brings new entrepreneurs.
Shailesh Bhosle had shown it .
I also said that the purpose of our Mudra Yojana is the same.
She received 40 thousand rupees from the Prime Minister's Mudra Yojana in terms of Mata Shram of Bhopal.
She is doing her jobs.
That is why she used to bring more money in the past and used to do a very hard business.
Now she is doing her best because of the dubbing of her hand in a bigger way.
She was more expensive due to other reasons.
Now, the amount paid by the bank will be more than Rs. 1000 per month.
A good business for their family is gradually growing.
However, I would like to make more proposals for this scheme.
They should help as many small businesses as possible.
We want to give them strength.

Whatever important role Mahatma Gandhi played in Africa-India relations, the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on both these lands is known to the people.
Several parlor friends have done this thing after that.
How wise it was.
A workshop was held in Bhopal in the last month.
On the Adarsh Gram Yojana, all the members of the Akdi village, district collector, parlor, all the Central and State Governments have worked deeply on the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
From the point of view of this, the rapid pace of tremors, tempests and blood circulation will come to Jharkhand whenever we hear them.
Several places have been destroyed due to the rapid impact of weather.
The officers encouraged tourism.
I congratulate Shriman Kariamunda, Member of Parliament.
Although the archaeological beauty of Nako is from Andhra .
He was elected to Lok Sabha from Mizoram, the North-Eastern state.
He has done a good job to elect the Rawala Hilling village in the North-East.
Shri Ruvala Gauge inaugurated the 11th Kurtai jaggery in this village.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has conveyed his best wishes to Shri Rawalagar for fulfilment of Adarsh village as well as self-reliant village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can we not reflect on cleanliness in this programme
This message was sent by a women television called Savitarai from Mumbai.
This time we will clean up our homes and our traditions.
As a result, the campaign on cleanliness has started following Deepawali.
You have said that whatever we think before the festival should be brought into the form of a festival festival.
We should do this in every public work.
Today, I convey my best wishes to all the media institutions in the country.
On October 2, last year, I had the opportunity to participate in the Swachh Bharat programme of Mahatma Gandhi on the occasion of India Today newspaper cleanliness.
Clean India Awards were conferred on the Institute.
I salute those like Won-Leak One Mission for Swachh Bharat.
Our country has cleaned all such countries.
All of them came to light and I heartily congratulated the India TV Group, which has done this marvellous work.
55,56,000 schools in the States of Andhra and Telangana participated in the programme.
Bahiranga States, Railway Stations, Spiritual countries, hospitals and parks have been spreading awareness about cleanliness in such areas.
Now these messages give us the power to achieve the goals of Swachh Bharat through these programmes.
Therefore, all the people of the country are now taking this programme forward by considering it as their hard work.
He further said that in Asia, Cleanest Village, the most clean village, has been found in this village.
It was heartening to note that in the state of Meghalaya in the North-Eastern region, we have spent several years in the cleaning of villages.
My beloved countrymen, I have some of the things that have been flooded in the Red Fort on 15th August.
When the poor goes to small businesses, how much money he gets for the safaris, how he asks for the bids of the groups, when he comes to work, the money goes out of his job.
I have never heard in the world how much a person understands a person in a single or two minute interview.
I convey my best wishes to all the young friends on this occasion.
And in the following budget, I announced a major scheme.
In our country, gold has become a part of our society.
You can deposit your gold in the banks under this.
Now do not keep gold in house .
The other thing is that in Savarin Gold Bond, there is no golden blanket in your hand.
But now we started it .
Therefore, there is no need to buy gold now.
In the coming week, the people of the country will come forward with this scheme of security.
I am very happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins and gold coins with Ashoka.
Why shouldn't our country have its own seal
Therefore, in the coming week, before Dhan Teresa, we will showcase the benefits of the common man and we will start five grams of Ashoka-based Indian gold coins.
With this, 20 grams of gold will also be available to the people.
I assure you that this new scheme will bring about a new change in the economy.
However, one mantra - we need to constantly intervene in our thinking, innovation and individualism.
There is a diversity in India .
Many legends, legends, many languages, different species, cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the only mantra.
Peace, harmony and unity.
Over the past several years, Run for Unity has been conducted at many places in the country on 31st October.
Take the mantra forward.
Now you will be on your own in the Deepawali organisation and you will be cleaning your houses.
New items can be bought.
The festival of Deepavali is celebrated everywhere in the country.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Deepavali.
But in the days of Deepavali, we are listening to a few issues.
Therefore, I am particularly enthusiastic about my visit to Britain.
It is indeed a matter of fact to study in the present world for women empowerment for many years old Bhagwan Vishwaswar Prajaswamy.
The statue of Bhagwan Vishwaswar on the ground of London will be an excellent example of how India's men and women think far and wide.
In a country like India, we should learn languages.
I will also make an effort to reach you in your language for 8 hours at night.
However, there was a good relationship between us.
Last year it was completed.
Now we are moving in a new year.
I convey my best wishes to my beloved countrymen once again.
Prime Minister's Office PM's Mann Ki Baat Programme (TH) September 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - Manas, one year, many words.
I don't know what you can do, but I can't tell you how much I can get.
The power of the people is immensely important in the democracy.
I have an optimistic idea in my life, and I am extremely grateful to the power of the people.
However, I learnt through this programme in Mann Ki Baat Manas, I got the meaning, I got it, and I would say that we think, more and more peoples power is negative.
Our ancestors said that the people of the country are a part of the Bhagwan.
But lakhs of people used to convey their best wishes to me.
This is a great power.
These lakhs of products taught me a great lesson.
That is - information should be reached from the bottom to the top level, it should go from the top to the bottom.
He said that this information will change in Mann Ki Baat Manas.
But this has happened.
Similarly, in Mann Ki Baat Manas, there has been a need to bring about a change in the power of conversation.
I urge all of you to keep in mind the tourism sector in India, Incredible India and Sodarshan.
But how big a hurdle has come.
People have sent photographs from all over the country, like lakhs of people.
A vision for the power of the people.
Once I have spoken in Mann Ki Baat Manas, there will be dust in the houses of poor people and children will be seven.
It is difficult for the common man, middle class, middle class and middle class to leave the stone.
There is nothing from Siachen but from the Kachchh region, but from Kamerup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari to Gony-Phone.
Fonds have been done from all the places .
This is a pleasant experience.
He sent his message to all age groups.
I like to hear a few messages myself and I am very good.
My Vrindavan is on them.
However, the reason is that they are not able to watch TV, so they listen to the radio.
I am aware of the importance of radio for those who do not see.
I see another new quote - how many good things they have told - it is enough to improve the government.
PAWAN Acharya was sent from Alwar in Rajasthan.
Soil problems are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with our soldiers on the auspicious occasion.
Our Army, Navy, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force.
The war with Pakistan was completed 50 years in 1965.
In this regard, the India Gate Shauranjali Exhibition was organised in Delhi.
I was surprised to see the teeth .
Fighting in Hajipur, but fighting on the day of Uttrakhand happened in Ghani and Chamunda, but on seeing the vicious scenes of Ayodhya and Hajipur Pass, romances keep on moving.
The law will meet with our weekly life.
I would like to visit you and your families - if you are around Delhi, it will be a few more days.
Don't go as soon as possible.
I returned in two and a half hours.
A young boy asked the Prime Minister, but the boy soon forgot to mention his name.
For the first time since independence, there has been an hour-long discussion on the issue of cleanliness in Parliament.
I am seeing good in this .
It is also the parlor of the country to discuss cleanliness.
On the one hand, parlors and parlors from across the country are talking about cleanliness.
And you know what Mahatma Gandhi says.
He said that once he has to choose one of both freedom and cleanliness, he will pursue cleanliness.
Cleanliness is more important for Gandhiji than independence.
He said that Din Dayal ji wants to know about Shakti.
2 Puja Bapu Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti.
Financial funds will be provided to the eligible beneficiaries for any payment of Rs. 5 or Rs.
You also have a little enjoyment.
When I went to Kolkata in the month of May, members of Subhash Chandra Bose's family met.
Chandra Bose, son of Sodhar, was also organised.
Subhash Babu's family members were happy and happy to spend the evening.
Chandra Bose and his family members were present in the event, and the last week was spent on the arrival of more than 50 members of the Subhash Bose to the Prime Minister's residence.
But more than that, they can enjoy that the Prime Minister's residence will never have the opportunity to give such an opportunity to our women, which will be available in October.
More than 50 members of the Subhash Babu family in different countries are coming forward for this purpose.
Is it a joy to enjoy it
Is it safe to have the invaluable power I have received
In the meantime, I visited Kashi.
Many people were included .
One of the students was Kshitij Pandey.
Banaras is prosecuting some of the Central Universities at the Hindu University.
However, in such a small age, I have seen physiotherapy related issues.
Whatever he said, he had a microscopic knowledge, but his belief has tasted.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the children of the country on scientific matters.
Sometimes it also enjoys a bit of this kind of thing.
Sometimes our skyscrapers - half an hour.
But I'll imagine your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Now it is a monthly success.
You know that Mann Ki Baat programme has been completed in a year.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu uses radio
"Azad Hind Radio" was interacted with Weekly News Bulletin.
He used to organize radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Pass and Urdu in all languages.
I am also talking to you in the sky.
My Mann Ki Baat - In my mind, the word has become meaningful in your mind.
I am the only one but those things will be yours.
Your suggestions should continue.
The government will also benefit from your suggestions.
The budget will come down.
Mann Ki Baat , 0555
On the second time there was a chance of coming between you to tell words in my mind .
In the southern direction of Sudur, people are drowned in Oman Sabaras and celebrated the festival of sacred Raksha Bandhan across the country.
The Government of India has entered many new stories for the social fragrance of common people .
11 crore families have reached this scheme since the beginning of this scheme.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the eve of the Pavitra Raksha Bandhan.
Today, I am talking to you - Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana has been brought to a bigger level today.
The chances of the youth are also available . In one year Bangkoking Rang , economic condition , lice .
Don't stop opening the cash deposits.
We have linked the poor to the benefits of bonds.
These banks are yours, you don't leave them now.
I have brought these things to you and now it is your privilege to buy them.
Our bank accounts should be alive.
I hope you don't buy it.
In such a scenario, events and possibilities of Gujarat have brought the nation together.
If anything happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel then the country will suffer and will suffer.
However, in a short while, the elders of Gujarat, my brothers and sisters, all the people of Gujarat have resolved the situation.
He played a crucial role in preventing the situation.
This is the right path of peace, unity and harmony.
Their words, the way they speak, that is, the compassion in the Sufi community, the harmony that is there in it, the composition of music is hidden.
I felt all these things while staying among them.
I believe that there is a need to tell the entire world the true form of Islam in the right way.
I am sure that love and affection in the Sufi community will reach this message far and wide.
I am also telling others that there is a need to understand the sufficiency of our partnership.
I get another opportunity in haste, and I consider this invitation fortunately.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the world will come to Buddha in India.
I have to participate in it and I am very happy that Buddha's coming and inviting me.
The first Prime Minister of our country, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
Even before this, I have proposed this thing in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
We have issued an Ordinance on land acquisition.
The Ordinance will be completed on 31st August.
But there was a deepness in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, we have taken this decision very quickly, not the Department of Expenditure, but as the Department of Expenditure and Revenue.
You don't have to be aware of fears.
It is simple to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri at the time of the 1965 war proposal.
The mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is also a reminder.
It is a great pleasure to remember the Trivandrum of India and the Amravis who laid down their pride.
Such historical events always inspire us.
Last week, I got the opportunity to meet the people of Sufi community - this is a pleasant opportunity.
I have got the opportunity to talk to the renowned scientists of the country for hours.
How to connect the laboratory at the area level
There is a need to take the team forward.
I am told in the following programme that whatever dreams we have in their eyes, there is a greater need and a lot of opportunity for the students to move towards science.
Especially to my young friends.
Everybody is running . At the lower level they can also be the cause of water .
The decision to liberate small scale industries from intervals is now almost impossible.
This is the first time that this is the second meeting of the United States.
Today, about 50 thousand pride in our country, 13 lakh children are reproducing or reproducing.
As we get rid of polio, we also get rid of tetanus about mother and childbirth.
There are reports about dengue.
Don't let death be so easy.
How much price is life .
Not paying attention to drinking water, but on cleanliness, these are the reasons for death - it is not simple.
Free dengue determination tests are available in 514 centres across the country.
Now we don't get the opportunity to repay the country, but we get the opportunity to live for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced Indias pride.
Sometimes, due to lack of awareness, we make our youth unfair.
I would like to know something about the new one - this is coming for centuries.
My experience with the youth is different.
Sometimes talking to the youngsters - there is a need to learn more from them.
They say that 'Sandy on Cycle' has been used.
It is a matter of fact that we are playing a cycle one day a week.
Man Ki Bath, June 2019.
O my beloved countrymen , worship .
Sometimes we were inspired to us .
In the middle of this time I can imagine how I spend time .
On Sunday , the last Sunday at 11 o'clock I felt as if I had lost something .
It feels sure .
Probably this is not a unforgettable program .
In this program life was alive , mind was lugggage , heart was lugggage , therefore in the midst of this program I felt very difficult .
But this sunday has waited a lot .
In the last few months, a lot of messages have come and people have also said that Mann Ki Baat is missing.
It will be very good for me when I read them .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in how many acquaintances
Your curiosity can be done .
I also feel that those emotions should be divided with you .
But if they talk then the form of 'Man Ki Baat' changes .
I am Baaldera before the end of the so many halts , Jaypjayas , even before the end of the polio .
Many people were discovered in it .
This is my vaccine , I have the opportunity to spend with me .
Everything can be said now that one pill of Ghani has become a chance to fill the cave in the Kedar valley due to a small break in the Mann Ki Baat.
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
When I do not say that I do but definitely .
Because you have that hiccup on me.
In the matter of Kedar people have spent a lot of time in your talk about some positive things with the same curiosity .
Sometimes the work of paying attention to my thoughts also keep your words .
Together with taking the problems , society of the country , society , challenges in my sight they also tell their results .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , pollutions keep trying to give their wrath to cleanliness .
That is , the result of a kind of problems is seen in your words in the society of the society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat is like a farewell to the society.
The international power , strength , talent in the residents of the country is known by this .
It is necessary to give a chance to concentrate those strengths , talents .
One more thing to know through this Mann Ki Baat is that every 130 crore people want to participate actively and efficiently in the development of the country.
You can imagine how much power I get when I am analyzing such things.
Actually I didn't come, you brought me, sat down and gave me a chance to talk again.
With this feeling we took the tradition of 'Mann Ki Baat' forward.
There was a obstacle in the mind of all the people .
Therefore the country has given so many administrations for the protection of democracy besides its own profit .
Perhaps in any country in the world, where the rest of the people, without taking their rights, powers and necessities, have not only put an end to democracy, but have seen 77 such numbers in this country in 77 (77).
Today, the Praswamy has been so many big initiatives in our country and everybody has participated in this festival with happiness and happiness to decide the future of our country.
When something is with us, we ignore the understimate, even its aaming facs.
This number may seem normal to us but if we see a Chinese in the world then more than any other country in the rest of the world today than the population of any other country can be said to be vomiting.
But how many people were put in the number of the members in 2019 , that number is more than the entire population of America .
The total number of Ooty in India is more than the population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness of our democracy.
The number of members in 2019 is still the biggest democracy of the world in history .
In such a situation you can imagine how big level human power , arrangements are needed .
It is possible that lakhs of teachers , rulers , employees were troubled by night .
Approximately three lakh Paramilitary teams have been responsible for ensuring this spirit of democracy, 20 lakh police personnel of various states have also worked at the grassroots level.
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting has been done .
You can imagine about 10 lakh Polling Stations across the country, about 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh Vivipat (VVPAT) machines, how big arrangements are made.
It has been done that one Ooty should not come to the unforgettable situation of its Ooty .
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a Polling station was organised for only one lady Ooty.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place in the world is in India .
It is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Not only this , there is also another opportunity of pride in these numbers .
Perhaps for the first time in history women also participated in Ooting with enthusiasm like men.
In these numbers the quantity of polio in women , men is approximately equal .
Although the reality of enthusiasm is that today in parlor 78 -LRB- 78 -RRB- women are employed .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard many times that I am not Book but Book.
In welcome we pray to give books instead of flowers .
Approximately at many places such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, I was given the book 'Prem Chand Ki Look Beloved Kahania'.
It gave me a lot .
I did not get much time , when I was in labor then I got the opportunity to read many stories again .
Their stories reflect the feelings of the entire India.
When he reads the story of 'Nasa', I turned my eyes towards the economic unrest of the society.
When I was young then how many nights were spent in the churches .
If we are not cautious about this story of Ishwari, poor family, then we know that whenever there is an effect of bad composition.
The second tale of my heart is Edgah, the heart of a child, the love of his mother's mother's son, and his father in such a small age.
Taking 4 . years from Hamid Sanctuary to go to my mother , in reality human heart is called the pride of human heart .
The last points of this story are not so emotional , the small Hamid old Hamid Part plays - old Amina , Amina have become a small sin .
In the same way, Pus Keet is a martial story.
In this story a poor painting is seen .
If its fruit is destroyed then it is not necessary to sleep at night like a field in the cold shivering itself .
In reality this stories were old for a century , today the contribution seems appropriate .
After reading these I felt a special experience .
If we talk about reading , in some media I read about Kerala 's Akshay Kshetra Library .
If this library is in a village of dense forests then you will not be surprised .
The first school teacher there was P . . .
K . . .
Both of them were constructed for this library .
Once the books had to be taken by bending on the shoulders .
Today this Library is seen everybody along with the children of tribals .
Gujarat - Gujarat -LRB- Gujarat -RRB- is a successful use in Gujarat.
In lacs of numbers all age groups participate in this garden .
Write about the books that you read in the NarendraModi App and all the people in Mann Ki Baat will be able to know about it.
My beloved countrymen , I am very happy that apart from the present people of our country think about future cooling .
I read your comments in the NarendraModi App and MyGovs. Many people are writing about the water problem.
Pavan Gaurai in Belgavi , Sitasu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar , and many others have written about water related problems .
Water has a lot of importance in our culture .
It has been said about the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness , sadness , sadness , sadness , sadness , sadness , sadness , sadness , energy , energy , energy .
Every year in many places of the country the problem of water is lifting up .
In the rainy season we can hide only 8  water in the water of rainy season that you are not surprised .
Only 8  .
The result of this problem has to be discovered .
Like all the rest of the problems , with the participation of people , with the capacity of 100 crore countrymen , with the help of this problem also solved this problem .
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country, particularly considering the importance of water.
By this decisions can be taken fast in all the matters related to water .
Some people did a new work .
The circumambulation of all the villages of the country has been written in the north .
It has been written that in order to smoke the water of the villagers , to collect water every drop of rain water every drop of rain water has been organised in the village council , to discuss with the villagers .
In this work with full enthusiasm this month crores of people were distressed in 22 thousand honeymoons .
People in the villages have made every drop of water consolidated.
Today, in the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, I will tell you a surpass.
Lupung Panchayati Sarpanch of Katam Sandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand is giving us a message.
The people there were ready to play their role once again for water conservation .
All the villagers , all the circumambulations of their activities are many ruins .
The people of the village , their villages feel like comparison to build water temples .
I see the positive results of exhibition by eating rice , social attempts .
There is no fervor for the result of the problem of water throughout the country .
Therefore efforts are being made in various places of the country .
This is why the problem of water logging is being solved.
There has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields of Kabir Dham in Rajasthan.
20 thousand women have collectively tried to revive the Naag Nadi in Vellore, Tamilnadu.
I also read that in Garhwal, all women are working hard on the Rain Water Harvesting.
I believe that if we try to make such efforts very strong then we will also be able to make it possible .
My first request - how did the people of the country propagate cleanliness, and also started a project for water conservation.
I believe that water is the prasad of Parameshwari.
To save one drop of water we make a necessity .
Talk about the problems of water in it , talk about water conservation methods .
Specially, for the mainstream of different regions, for water conservation, the innovative campaigns have to be supported.
Leave film rang , do not let our friends of media , do not let the people of social institutions , not let the people of cultural heritage , but let everybody ignore this garden in their own way .
Wake the society , make the society together , work together with the society .
See , we definitely see changes before our eyes .
I have to share those traditional methods of water conservation .
If you have the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Port Bunder, Puja Bapu, there is a house behind the house of worshipping Bapu, where there is a water tank of 200 years .
Therefore when I am supposed to go to Kirti Mandir then definitely see that water tank .
Come , we will not inspire the conservation of water conservation for people by making many methods related to water conservation .

The chance for Holistic Health Care has increased, in which the growth of yoga has increased.
During the sunrise in all the corners of the world yoga practice is welcomed , sunset is celebrated .
Where humans were observed Yoga there .
Hindu Mahasagar Varuku , Siachen Sub Marine Varuku , Air-Fore , Air-craft carriages from the Himalayas , ACGs to the desert of the villages , where there is a chance of not only Yoga , but also of Yoga .
The world has shown me how many Presidents, Prime Ministers, Famous people, common citizens and their countrymen have observed Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day the whole world looked like a happy family .
Therefore the prophecy of yoga is a great congregation .
Do not recognize this service by giving identity to this service .
Prime Minister's Awards to those who played a special role in Yoga Promotion and Development in 2019 have given me a great pleasure.
This book has been given to several institutions around the world, and you cannot imagine how important it is to promote Yoga as a whole.
For example, if we take 'Japan Yog Niketan', it has created Yoga throughout Japan.
'Japan Yoga Niketan' runs many institutes and training courses there.
Later Ms. of Italy.
Antonietta Roi started the Sarvayog International and proposed Yoga throughout Europe.
All these are sports .
In the matter of yoga there is no reproduction behind Indians .
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya , Munger also received this book that in the last few decades this is Yoga .
Yogas extensive celebrity and Yoga messages have made this Yoga even more remarkable.
My beloved countrymen, our journey starts today. New emotions, new experiences, new ability.
Although I am waiting for your advice .
It is a special journey for me to walk with your thoughts and it is only for Mann Ki Baat.
Come , we are talking .
Listen to your emotions , keep understanding .
Sometimes try to live according to those emotions .
Your zeals should never be on me .
You are my inspiration , ye are my strength .
Come, let's communicate with the beauty of Mann Ki Baat and fulfil the talents of life.
Once again we will meet in Mann Ki Baat in the coming month.
Blessed is your everybody .
Namaskar .
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
The mind is heavy while starting the Manki Bath .
The creator of ten days had lost his sons .
These transgressors have lost their life for the protection of 125 crores of our country .
For sleeping peacefully the people of the country these virtues save us from their sleep .
Our weapons are always presenting unparalleled adventurous adventurous adventurous games .
Ram Niranjan, the father of Ratan Thakur, the Amarvir of Bagalpur in Bihar, also inspires us in such a tragic moment.
It is said that he will also send his second son to fight with enemies , if necessary he will also fight .
Seeing the courage of the wife of the Amarvir of Jagsinghpur of Orissa , seeing the courage of the wife of Sahu , the country of Yavat is worshipped her .
This small psychological psychological psychologically tells us all the small children of India .
Such emotions , our virtue , paralysis , Amravi are seen in the houses .
Their families are also not minerals in it .
The martyr of Deoria, the family of Vijay Maurya, the mother of Tilak Raj of Kangra, the son of Amarvir of Kotta, the son of Hemraj six, the story of every family of these martyrs is full of inspiration.
I want to understand the feelings exhibited by these families , to understand the youth .
The living witnesses situated in front of our eyes are the inspirational examples of the future of India .
My beloved countrymen, when we came to freedom, all of us are waiting for a memorial of war.
I was surprised that there was no national war memorial in India .
For the protection of the country there is a memorial of the martyrdom of the martyrs of their lives .
I decided to make such a memorial in the country .
It is a matter of very happy to fulfil this construction at a very little time to make one of the national war memorials .
To morrow , i . . February 25th honey , our crores of the country have given this national soldiers to our army .
This is a small attempt to fulfil their teeth .
This memorial has been organised near the heart of Delhi i . . in Delhi where India Gate , Amarvila Jyoti .
It is a complete belief for me to visit this national soldiers to visit a pilgrimage of the country .
After the independence of the country the soldiers given maximum sacrifices for the country are the symbol of this national soldiers .
This memorial shows the unparalleled adventurous adventurous adventurous .
The National Soldiers Memorial is based on four core concentration circles and in the first circulation, the entire journey from the birth of every soldier has been painted.
The jewellery of the Amarkantak is a symbol of the Amarkantak .
The second circumambulation cycle.
There is a dense tree in this wheel .
If seen on soil , to know about the important martyrs of our country , to tell them thanksgiving them , to search them about them it has changed this place to display this national memorial .
To stay with our lives , the country remains safe , to develop their lives are here .
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the words of our weapons , police , Para Military teams .
In the last seventh October I also got the privilege of giving this national soldiers to the country .
This National Police Memorial is a reflection of the thoughts of the women police and other men police personnel who are constantly involved for the protection of all of us.
I hope that to see all the memorials of the national soldiers , national police memorial .
When you go there , definitely make the photographs taken there in Soshil media so that others can also be inspired to go there .
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, you will get the opportunity to read thousands of norths, businesses and meditation through different mediums.
This time, if you read your descriptions, I got an interesting information written by Ashish Mukhopadhyay.
What is he , when the English had done Birsa Munda on 3th March , 1900 , March , then his age was only buried .
Birsa Munda in Mann Ki Baat, paying homage to the two Jamshed ji Tatas in a way recalling the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two important officers have increased not only Jharkhand but the softness of India .
Along with them Gunu Yat India is thanksgiving to them .
It is necessary to know about any inspirational personality of the youth , it is important to recognize the Mahabharata Birsa .
And the English took him while he was asleep .
Do you know why they have done such a cost .
He had seen all this in his small lifetime .

But I want to say something .
Seeing how many arrangements are held in India the whole world is surprising .
You must have heard about Gujarat .
In a beautiful place of Gir forest a polio shoe is spent only for one Ooty .
With the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty for one Ooty , with the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty , how many accidents of the industry see how many afar off places .
This is the beauty of our country .
I am giving how many accidents to keep our Ganesha strong .

As soon as Azad Hind Circar was made in the completion of 75 years .
Subhash Babu is always remembered as a soldier , a expert .
Many times have been desired to make the files related to Netaji .

Those who see their pictures , understand that picture , they want to understand the message of that picture with their own point of view .
His wives are also exhibited in European countries , Russia , America .
It is believed that you will definitely go to see his leopards in the Cranti temple .

On the 3rd of October 2014, on the occasion of Vijayadashmi, the Mann Ki Baat programme was organised.
Our Mann Ki Baat fulfils fifty bonds with this journey of Dharwahi.

Vikas Yadav from Ansh Kumar, Amar Kumar, Patna, Delhi in May Gau
What is the whole week , people ask you to be more technology , social media , mobile ypnotise , mobile ypnotise .
But why did you choose radio to meet people
I have to tell you a story .
This was the thing in 1998 .
I was working in Himachal Pradesh as a member of the Indian Janta Party.
The couple of ' Bharat ' is called a bomb .
I don't understand.
Sometimes he said that on listening to radio , radio has been discussed on the same thing .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpei Garhwal came forward , it was told that on that day the test was done that how much this tea has been detected in radio .
It was estimated that radio was estimated .
It is natural to return to my sight in the midst of the most powerful meditation after the prime minister .
Feed Back coming in this survey is very interesting .
How expansive church has also been done about Lehpositive .
This is a straight example of social point of view , positive emotional emotions situated in the minds of all our country .
Because of the Mann Ki Baat program the feeling of voluntary service has also increased in people .
People are coming forward at a big height for social service .
I am very happy to change radio more favorite to the people because of the Mann Ki Baat program .
The northern tips , lines , phones , photographs , in all these the absorptions are clearly visible .
Modi comes, he goes, but this country remains stable and our culture remains alive.
All these small stories of the country of 130 crores are alive forever .
All this country gives new inspiration to this country , with new enthusiasm the highest peaks .
My experiences also participate with water .
After that gradually this thing goes towards a change by cutting the marks of house , social meditation , vatsop .
Teaching all his households as well, sometimes the Prime Minister in the phone calls also gets the plague.
What can be the power of the government that can be harnessed not only in the country of Yavat but also abroad
Many times Man Ki Baat has also become a victim of adventurous but in my mind at any time 130 crore people of the country are always there .
All of them are my mind .
Manki Bath is not the word of the government , this is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is a spiritual India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious gloriously is that you are asking a man near one .
If you want to answer your question easily then there is nothing to be made .
Absalom is a very easy task for me .
Every time the norths of people come in front of Man Ki Baat .
My Gau, Narendra Modi mobile app, people share their thoughts and also have a toll free number - 1800117800.
People done this November record their message with their throat .
Before the beginning of Mann Ki Baat my attempt to read more north , more expansions themselves .
I have heard a lot of phone calls myself .
Do not fall near the Mann Ki Bath Programme , how much of the thoughts that I sent you in the time of my journey will I read .
Every moment all the people of my country are in my mind . Therefore who read the north , the situations of northern writing , their emotions become part of my thoughts .
This north is not just a piece of pocket .
Actually the truth is that the name of the village , person etc . is mouthed .
I thank everyone involved in Mann Ki Baat, for examples, emotions, excitement and excitement.
Without reading their north , expressions the number of people sending northerns , wildlife again is in lakhs .
An attempt is also made to bring the unparalleled north and information related departments in Mann Ki Baat.
Blessed is also told to all my partners in radio , far-off , remaining T . . Chhaanal , social meditation .
Because of their trouble Man Ki Baat reached most people .
Akashwani Vrindavan is published in many languages every Mann Ki Baat program .
Some people are also listening to the voice of living near the throat in the regional language as well .
Similarly they are changing the Nrandra Modi along with those three minutes .
I want to hear the program of Man Ki Baat in your languages as well .
It is believed that everybody has done less awareness about themselves , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological acquaintances .
But many things proposed in Mann Ki Baat changed the media in its own matters .
Cleanliness, Road Conservation, Drugs Free India, Selfie with Daughter etc.
If you do not have any support then the journey of this Mann Ki Baat was incomplete .
"Thank you very much for your phone call.
The truth is that there is no secret near me .
Old things of our own life do not stop us , it is easy to understand anyone before .
Sometimes our paralysis gives the biggest obstacle to the conferences .
Not confessing , not confessing , trying to understand something instead of every activity is my first priority .
I keep trying to talk with various programs or social meditations .
I keep trying to understand that they do , thinking .
It is very good to question the youth .
They're experts in multi-tasking.
If we pay attention to our surroundings, social enterprises, start-ups or any other kind of changes in the society.
If the question is courageous , adventurous dreams are young .
If we bring the youth thoughts to the ground , give them freedom to express them then they can bring social changes in the country .
My beloved countrymen, I would like to talk about the day-to-day celebrations of Mann Ki Baat i. e.
Today it is very special , because we were asking the state today in the seventieth year .

Prior to independence, on January 27, 1947, the world famous journal "Team Magazine" was published by Sardar Patel on the journal Cauvery.
This journal has given the status of an India in its Lead Store .
But it is not like the fall of India .
It is the fall of India divided into many parts .

My beloved countrymen, many people are coming forward voluntarily to organise social programmes and all of them are also inspired by the people of the country.
We will be able to see this legacy in every corner of the society, everywhere, everywhere in the society.
But in this new age , new generations are coming forward to do this task with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name is 'self 4 society' . My software , and the country's IT , electronic industries don't have to motivate their jobs and social programs , so that they don't give them the right chances of this portal .
On seeing the enthusiasm , devotions seen throughout the week to organise this program all Indians are proud .
The journey from IT to society is not me, but we are not aware, but through self-confidence.
Some children read , some elders are reading .
Some people pay attention to cleanliness , some are helping the rails .

My dear brothers and sisters, this time, if I look at all your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen an interesting explanation from Pondicherry to Shri Manish Mahaparinirvana.
It is said that what is in his Gaudi , how important example of ' Bharati Gijan traditions , customs , nature along with nature you should say in the program of Man Ki Baat ' .
Manish Garu , such things have been impossible for proposing you beforehand .
The good opportunity to inspire us to see our glorious culture , past , is that this is the world , especially the western countries are being discussed to protect environment .
Our India also faces this problem .
For its result we should take a pill once in ourselves and see our history , traditions once again .
Especially we should know the lifestyle of our tribals that it is in the culture of our tribals .
Our tribal brother brothers worship trees , trees , fruits and goddesses .
In the middle India especially in Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region of Madhya Pradesh , the tribals of Bhilwara , Arjun trees are worshipped .
In the desert area like Rajasthan the society of Vishnoi society has seen how to conserve environment .
Especially in the matter of conserving trees they are ready to make their life soldiers but one tree does not harm .
It is believed that the miscarriage of Arunachal Pradesh is related to tigers .

Adivasis make their houses with natural substances , along with being strong they also do good for environment .
In South India a small cut of smoke residing in the same area of Nilgiri Peeth in the southern India makes their buses available with small objects .
It is true that my beloved brother Sodarimans , tribals believe that they will be able to live peacefully mixed with themselves but if someone harms their natural forests then they will not be afraid of fighting for their rights .
My beloved countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat we recognise the people who have done extraordinary work for the society.
Seeing small , it has a very deep effect on those tasks .
I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab for some days .
A common ritual gurubachan singinging has been married .
Before this marriage Gurubachan Garhwal had married the marriage of the parents of the parents , but I was a Sherut .
But after listening to a simple driver Gurubachan , all of you will be surprised that is the true strength of our society .
Shri Gurubachan Singh has kept such an example before us .
I read about Kallar Majra, another small village near Nabha of Punjab.
Why did this village come to the church of Kallar majra , where people want to harvest grains , instead of burning in the fields , instead of burning them in the field , how much technology is needed for it .
My best wishes to brother Gurubachan Singh .
My belief is to all the people trying to keep the environment clean for the people of Kallar majra .
Your clean lifestyle is walking ahead really everybody of Indian tradition .
If drops , chuckles are included then small precautions , good tasks , social tasks , always play an extremely important role in making the environment .
In life , in me , in thy heart , in every cell of Jagat , everywhere peace is established .
The 11th November coming to India is special because the first world war was completed on November 11th November .
The end of the war was completed , when the heavy destruction , people completed a century .
First world war is an important incident of India .
If we want to say properly then we have no relation with unsuccessful war .
Even then our soldiers fought with so much virtue , how big role was played , most sacrifices were given .
On coming to the war Indian soldiers had seen the world .
In rare places , Vishakhapattanam also our soldiers have seen their beauty .
The goal behind all these is to restore peace.
In the first world war the world has seen the discovery of the world .
According to estimates approximately one fort soldiers , other forts had lost their lives .
Therefore how important is the world known .
In the past the meaning of peace has changed .
This is peace , Sadbhava meaning not only the war .
Change in the environment from acute pain , economic development has to change the social judgment .
Nirodh is the true signal of the development of the person .
