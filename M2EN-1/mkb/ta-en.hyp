Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that some Indian community is taking part in this thing
Now several governments, citizens and social movements are also celebrating Deepavali with full fervor and enthusiasm.
In a way, it can also be said that India is set up there.
Friends, there is an attraction of festival tourism in the world.
There are many possibilities for festival tourism.
If our efforts are to be done then we should fulfil the festivals like Holi, Deepavali, Honam, Pongal and Bihu.
In our country, different types of festivals take place in every state, every part of the country, among which people from other countries take a lot of patriotism.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in expanding festive tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something different on this Diwali.
I had also said that on this Diwali, we will celebrate the strength and achievements of the women of India, that is, we will pay homage to the people of India.
In a few days, stories in the social media have begun to emerge.
In the App, he said that his mother is his power in the form of Namo App.
In the 1990s, when my father was old, my mother accepted the golden gold of five children.
Today we have five brothers sitting in good work.
My best wishes to your mother.
Next, Geetika Swami, who is very interested in the dwarf, has said that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the hero of India.
In their case, Kavitha Tiwari is the daughter of India's mother, and she gives her strength.
The mother is very proud that her daughter is very artistic.
He also has good marks in the legal entrance examination of CLAT.
People are sharing such information.
You must read, get excited, share something in your neighbourhood like those who are present in it. On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all these great personalities of India.
We know that the foundation for this has been laid by him in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November this year, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is spread not only in India but all over the world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters live in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to Guru Nanak Dev ji's high aims.
I cannot forget that I went to Venuvar and Gurudwara in Tehran.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev had to share a lot of things about them, but it would require a lot of segments of Mann Ki Baat.
He regarded the service of Nanak Dev ji as much as possible.
Guru Nanak Dev ji considered selfless service worthless.
He strongly voiced and acted against social evils such as evil.
The message of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji spread across the world.
He was one of those who traveled a lot in his time.
He has gone to many places, wherever he goes, he will triumph over the hearts of everyone through his simpleness and service.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had undertaken several important religious tours, which are called Udayasi.
He carried the message of harmony and equality from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from all directions to the people of all regions, from sovereignty and saints.
Even Shankardev ji, the renowned saint of Assam, is believed to have received inspiration from him.
He travelled on the holy land of Haritwar.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed in Gurubagh Gurudwara, a village in Kashi.
He has also visited the holy places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bihar, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the water conservation there.
It reminds us that this is a famous place named Guru Nanak era Sahab, which has been dedicated to him.
During a period, Guru Nanak ji travelled in the north, Kashmir and its neighbouring areas.
This led to a very strong link between the Sikhs and the Kashmiris.
And Guru Nanak Dev ji went to Tibet, and the people that were there accepted him as a guru.
He is also bowed down to the country of Uzbekistan in Thalassery.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited a large number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He has been in the hearts of millions of people who have followed his teachings with full integrity and are following even today.
Just a few days ago, the government's ambassadors from around 85 countries went from Delhi to the Amrudas.
And there they visited Gold, and all this happened on the 550th birthday of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
On this day, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the iron man of India, was born and he was the son of a slave who joined the country.
Sardar Patel had a marvellous ability to integrate people to them, while it was capable of harmonizing those who had differences.
He's really the Man of Detail, capable of watching the nucleus.
Besides, he has expertise in organisational activities.
The art of making plans and formulating strategies.
When we read about Sardar ji's work, we know how strong his planning was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country had come to attend the Congress conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the arrangements of the conference were imposed on Sardar.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's water network.
He ensured that no one should have water scarcity.
He interacted with the farmers and appealed to them to do the paper bags.
At the same time, a substantial increase in charter sales was confirmed.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution.
He was an important figure in determining fundamental rights, which did not constitute any inequality based on caste and religion.
Friends, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, as the first interior minister of the country, has succeeded in a smooth and smooth attempt to integrate the settlements.
In fact, while talking about Sardar Patel's efforts, we only talk about his contribution to certain areas of integration of the country.
When Sardar Patel received this message, he immediately stepped into serious action, without delaying a moment.
When he was under his command and immediately flew to the threshold, it was dumped into the evil desire of the enemy to capture millions of islands.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked his brothers and sisters to ensure that all necessary assistance is provided for the development of lakhs of islands.
Today lakhs of islands are contributing significantly to Indias progress.
This is an attractive tourist spot.
I am confident that you all will visit its beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, a statue of unity was dedicated to the nation and the world to honour Sardar Saheb's memorial.
This is the world's largest statue.
This is a two-storey statue of the goddess of freedom in the US.
Every Indian is proud of the world's tallest statue.
Every Indian's head is glorified.
I am very happy that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists have come to visit the statue of unity.
Every day 8500 people have seen the glory of the idol of unity.
It seems that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Sapadikulam Garden, Battambhoomi Garden, Vanchalla, Child Nutrition Park and Unity Narsari, which has led to the development of the economy of the region and new opportunities for employment for the people.
Friends, for all the states, for the tourism sector, this unity statue can be a testimony.
Within a year, we all are witnesses of how a place can become a world famous tourist destination.
There are people of our country and those coming from abroad.
Traffic, rehabilitation, guides and environment friendly organisations are developing one after another.
I also urge you to spend a little while on your priceless occasions and visit the statue of unity.
But at the same time, every Indian travelling with his family visit at least 15 places in India and stay there in the night, I once again insist on this request.
Friends, from 2014 to October 31st, you know that we are pursuing the nation's unity day.
On this day, we communicate with the message of saving the price of unity, integrity and security of our country.
On 31st October, the movement for unity is being organised like every year.
This will include all sections of the society and all sections of the society.
In such a way, this movement is being implemented not only for body, but also for inner and beneficial, but also for India's unity and for touching new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has linked the country with unity.
This mantra of unity is like a milestone in our lives and in a diverse country like India, we must gather the strength of this mantra of unity at every stage, every turn and every step.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very positive and awakened to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around, many examples of those involved in the sustainable process of developing mutual harmony will be seen.
But in many times, the effort of the society disappears very quickly from its contribution and memories.
Friends, I am well remembered in September 2010 and the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on the Ramjanmabhoomi issue.
But after the verdict on the Ramajanmabhoomi, the then state, political parties, social organisations, society, representatives of all religions, sages and priests spoke very quietly and neutral.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure on the environment.
Those days, those moments are a reminder of our duty to all of us.
This is an example of how unity is the greatest strength of the country.
Even the gods who have experienced the benefits, 125 crore Indians themselves.
But there is a comfortable experience and an interesting experience.
I heard, why shouldn't I share with you
Just imagine... the world's highest battlefield is 50-60 degrees below the cool breeze.
Life in the air is only in some name.
In such a catastrophic situation, living in the midst of so many challenges is nothing less than any militancy.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders but also organising a clean Siachen movement.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations and thanks to the people of the country for this magnificent duty of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to forget any substance in the extreme cold there.
In this context, it is extremely important to analyze dustbins and make arrangements.
If there is any climate here then it is in the lives of rare animals like ice cream and rare animals like iPex and brown bear.
My dear countrymen, the festivals are a new awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, on Deepawali, particularly in every family, the purchase of something new and bringing something from the market.
I had once said that we should try to buy local goods.
If we get the necessary material in our village then what is the need to go to the regional level
What is the need to go to the district level if one thing is available at the regional level
The more we try to buy locally available goods, the more Gandhi 150 himself will blossom as a great opportunity.
I reiterate my request to you that we should take something or the other on the handicrafts of our trouble-makers, and those who have prepared our papers.
Deepavali also conveys good wishes and also challenges us to become those who want to buy more local goods.
We must show how important we can contribute to realizing the dreams of Gandhiji through this.
I once again convey my best wishes to Deepavali on this auspicious occasion.
On Deepawali we burn a variety of sheep.
However, sometimes our focus is on fire due to deficiency.
There is wound.
Therefore, I urge you to save yourself while celebrating the festivals.
My best wishes to Deepavali.
Thanks a lot.
He is always ready to express his happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore countrymen of India celebrated the victory of Barakram Buru.
We were reminded of the accurate attack that took place in 2016, and our soldiers gave a strong response to the dubious war against our country, which was demanded in the radical battlefield.
Our soldiers were organising exhibitions at various places in the country to showcase our strength to the citizens of the country, particularly the youth.
See how capable we are, how our soldiers are protecting our countrymen by risking their lives.
One day like the Barakram Mountain reminds the youth of the great tradition of our soldiers.
And inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, the brave-hearted Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that our soldiers will give them a strong response, who are trying to contribute to the peace and development of our country.
India is committed to maintaining peace and dedication.
In the two world wars of the twentieth century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace, even if we had no connection with those wars.
This is also an invasion of our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Over the years, our brave soldiers have played a crucial role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things related to heaven will be different.
In this way, it is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has attracted everybody's attention by expressing their energy in the sky.
They have given us a sense of security.
One of the aspirations and aspirations of the people of the march on the occasion of Independence Day celebrations is Air Sahas, in which our Air Force will showcase their strength with the devastating activities.
We are celebrating the Air Force Day on October 8th.
In 1932, our Air Force launched a small scale launch with 6 aircraft and 19 air warriors. Today the 21st century is one of the most courageous and powerful air force.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Force and their families who have served for the nation.
In 1947, when Pakistanis launched an unexpected attack, our air force decided to save Sri Nagar from the attackers and landed Indian soldiers' weapons and weapons of war at the right time in the battlefield.
The Air Force responded strongly to the enemies in 1965.
Who are those who don't know about the 1971 Bangladesh Freedom Fight
In the Tiger Hill area, all the enemies hid in the hiding places were bombarded by night and covered them with dust.
The country is grateful to the Air Force for the warmth of our air warriors, as a result of rescue and relief operations and disaster management.
Their spirit is amazing to deal with all the calamities from storm, storm, flood to forestry and help the countrymen.
In order to create gender equality in the country, the Air Force has set an example and has opened the doors of each of their departments for women.
I had made this announcement from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
We can proudly proudly say that the contribution of the Indian Army's military forces is increasing not only male power but also the role of women power.
Women's powerful people are now becoming armed and armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our naval officers has confronted the struggle of Abhilash Tomy and Livelihood.
The whole country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know that Abhilash Tomy is a very clever officer.
He is the first Indian to travel in a small boat without any modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he had been moving forward without reducing his speed in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the south of the Indian Sea.
A few days ago, when Abhilash was taken out of the sea, I spoke to him with a phone call.
I've already met Tommy.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Domi, his passion, his hard work, his dedication, his warmth and power will certainly inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country will be aware of the importance of our country on 2nd October.
The 2nd of October this year has a greater significance.
Since then, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we are organizing several events all over the world.
The ideas of Gandhiji have inspired the whole world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to you about one more important work of the Vanakacharya brother and the countrymen should know this thing.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle was intensified, he prepared a copies of those thoughts.
He put forward his views on various issues such as protection, cleanliness and widespread education of farming, farmers, villages and workers.
This is called Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced this in the most exclusive form of his individuality.
He gave every person the feeling that everyone is very important and important to the nation.
His great contribution to the freedom struggle was the transformation of this into a mass struggle.
All sections of the society, all sections of the society, took forward the challenge of Gandhiji in the freedom struggle.
And if you tell me, "I give you a shield, whenever you feel skepticism, whenever you feel skepticism, keep this measure - look at the man who is very weak and weak, remember his face, listen to your mind, listen to your mind, ask your mind how much benefit you have done, so see how much benefit that person will benefit.
This will brighten his life and future
My dear countrymen, this valour of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle-class people of the country, their growing economic power and their purchasing power...
Whether we go to buy something or not, can we remember the brother for a moment
Can you remember her sister's skin
Whose face shall be glad
Who will be benefitted by buying you directly or indirectly
If this benefits the poorest of the poor, then my happiness will be strong.
Remember this mantra of Gandhiji, when we all take something in the days to come, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, when we buy every thing, our countrymen should do well, especially those who have spent their sweat, who have invested their money, who have sown their capabilities in it, all of them should get some benefit in some way.
He might have been unaware of how this would happen - but this happened and India got independence.
Likewise, today we feel that this small task of mine can contribute to the economic development of my country, to the economic powerful role of the poor in achieving the power of fighting against poverty.
But today, this is the real patriotism, and this is the Karyanjali which we can provide for our farming.
He said that all these gates have been distressed with great difficulty, and every corner of them should be used.
And there was mixed with the snare of the land, and with the snare of the land, in every corner of the glory of the glory.
We are going to celebrate Sastri ji's birth anniversary two days later.
His slogan, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a sign of his great personality.
As a result of his selfless commitment to the nation, he was able to provide a mantra of success for the soldiers and farmers of the country in a short span of about one and a half years.
Millions of people have joined this movement and I got an opportunity to serve with the children of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
The foundation for the school is the honorable Baba Saheb.
All kinds of people from all over the country were engaged in this service on 15th.
Organisations also contributed very encouragingly.
School children, college students, national students, nationwide welfare programmes, youth organisations, media groups, corporates, all served in a big way in cleanliness.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those countrymen who want cleanliness for their contribution.
Let's hear a telephone call.
But if you had not been able to telephoned how this was a journal for you after the toilets, then the attention of the people associated with this movement would not have been comfortable.
I express my gratitude to you in a special way.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in our country but also in the world.
This time, India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness summit in a way that is unprecedented.
In the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and sectoral experts from all over the world share their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The closing ceremony of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October this year to mark the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary of the mother.
The Constitution passed by Babasaheb Ambedkar contains several implications for the protection of the fundamental rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993 with inspiration from that vision.
The Commission is set up to complete 25 years in a few days.
The Commission is not only protecting human rights but also enhancing the dignity of man.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the closest leader of our hearts, said that human rights are not a unique principle for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the principle of 'Sarve Bhawand Sukina', which has come from the Vedic times, has been fabricated.
The Commission has created widespread awareness on human rights and has also played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
This 25-year journey has created a hope and a hopeful environment for the countrymen.
It provides a healthy society with a belief in the best democratic values.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also functioning.
As a society, we need to understand and pursue the importance of human rights, this is the basis of progress for all and for all.
My dear countrymen, Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji are starting the birth centenary in October.
All these dignitaries have been inspiring us and we will remember them.
Sardar ji's birth anniversary comes on 31st October and I will talk about it in a detailed way in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I want to mention him why for a few years Sardar ji's birth anniversary is being organized on 31st October in every small city of India, in every small town of region and village of India.
This year we have to make efforts to organise this movement for unity in our villages, regions, cities and cities.
The movement for unity is the best way to think about Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you, on 31st October, we must strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society, every section of the country, every section of the country with the help of unity, this will be a great tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating the festival of Rakshabandhan.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
Rakshabandhan has been advancing love and trust among the elder brothers and sisters.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
Even after Raksha Gair, there are many special stories in the history of the country that connected two different regions or religious people with the help of faith.
A few days later, Genmastami will come to Kashi.
All around the environment, elephants, horses, palanquins - Jai Kanheyal Keey and Govinda-Kovinda are shouting sweetly.
The experience of enjoying Sri Krishna's devotion is incredible.
Our youth must have made preparations for Dahi-Handi in many parts of the country, particularly in Maharashtra.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen for Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Thank you, sister Sinmai, for putting forward a good thing.
Friends, Besides Rakshabandhan, we are celebrating the Samaskrit day on the occasion of Chiravana pavilion.
I extend my best wishes to all those who have dedicated themselves to bringing this great treasure to the common man.
Every language has a great significance.
Everyone in India is proud of the oldest language in the world
Likewise, it is a matter of great pride for all of us Indians that the language of samskrit has played a very important role in spreading wisdom from the time of Vedic period to today.
The enlightenment of every field of life lies in the language of Sanskrit and its literature.
Be it scientific, technological, agriculture, healthcare, architecture, mathematics, management, economy or environment...
You all will be happy to know that even today, the people of Tatur village in Shimoga district of Karnataka are using Samskrit as a case language.
Thousands of phrases, 200 phrases, i.e. prefix, 22 phrases, sufficix and the possibility of creating an insignificant phrase of society
Therefore any pure feeling or thing can be described in accurate manner .
We always remember Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan.
We celebrate his birthday as a teacher day all over the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day.
Friends, I convey my best wishes to the teachers for their dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, this season has brought a lot of expectations to our hardworking farmers.
In some places it is natural to have more rainfall than other places.
We all saw how bad the lives of the people were affected by the horrific floods in Kerala.
Though we cannot fully fulfil their grief, I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you at this moment of sadness.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity should benefit quickly.
Everyone decides how to reduce the problems of the people of Kerala and how to share their grief.
We know that the soldiers were the heroes of rescue operations in Kerala.
They have left no effort to save the flooded civilians.
All the Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Border Security Force, Central Industries Security Force and Expedition have played a major role in this movement.
In particular, at this time, I would like to mention the hard work of the NDRF fighters, the National Disaster Management Force.
Yesterday, the festival was celebrated, this festival should give strength to the nation, particularly to Kerala, and they should come up quickly from the impact of this disaster and let us all call for the development journey of Kerala at a rapid pace.
Once again, I assure all the citizens of the country, the people of Kerala and all those affected by disasters across the country that the entire country is very close to you during this difficult period.
My dear countrymen
This time I was watching the suggestions for Mann Ki Baat.
I had seen that the countrymen have written a lot about this thing - Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, who loved us all.
Keerthi of Kajiyabad, Swatwas of Soniba, Praveen, brother of Kerala, Dr.
I would like to talk about the diversity of Atal ji's life as Akhilesh Pandey from Kadihar, Swan Pennjee, Bihar and MyGov.
On the 16th of August, the nation and the world heard the news of Atal ji's time and sadness.
14 years ago, he saluted the Prime Minister's Office.
In a way, for the past decade, he has been away from radical politics.
He did not attend the news, he was away from public life.
Though the New Year is a huge gap, the country and the world have seen that there has been no gap between the minds of the common Indian since August 16.
Atal's love, grief and turmoil emerged for them in the country, which demonstrates his great personality.
Over the past few days, Atal ji's very important dimensions have emerged before the nation.
People recall him as the best parliamentarian, the best writer, the best speaker, the Prime Minister of the people's mindset.
The nation will be grateful to Atal for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
But today I want to talk about another dimension of Atal ji's widespread governance and to show that Atal ji will be very useful in the days to come because of the political culture and efforts made by Atal ji to transform India into a systematic zeal.
It's sure.
India will be grateful to the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003.
This transformation has led to two important changes in Indian politics.
First of all, the number of ministers in the States should be 15 of the total number of MPs.
Secondly, according to the anti-party legislation, he increased the size of one third of the previous members to two thirds.
Moreover, clear regulations were made to ensure the death of members of the party's members.
For decades, there has been a political culture that has been established in India in large numbers, and these big ministries have not been able to share the work, but political leaders have been retained.
Atal ji changed this situation.
Money and expenses were saved due to this activity.
There was also improvement in performance.
This was possible only through a resolution like Atal ji, and the healthy tradition of our political culture began to flourish.
Atal ji is a real patriot.
In his term of office, it was changed at the time of submitting a financial statement.
Previously, the Financial Report was submitted to the British at 5 p.m.
In 2001, Atal turned the time of submitting a financial statement from 5pm to 11pm.
Likewise, today you are watching the discussions about holding elections for the central government and the state governments in the country at the same time.
On this occasion, I dedicate to Atal ji on behalf of all of us, the Prime Minister said.
When the talk of parliament arises, it is spoken about the turmoil, shouting and postponement of the House, but if something good happens, there is no more talk about it.
A few days ago, the rainy season of the Parliament was over.
You will be happy to know that the positive strength of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the ability of the Rajya Sabha was 74.
All parliamentarians tried to make the monsoon session more useful over party differences, resulting in the passage of 21 legislations in the Lok Sabha and 14 legislations in the Rajya Sabha.
The rainy season of both the Houses will be rememberable for social justice and youth welfare.
Several legislations were passed during this meeting with the youth and the backward classes for fear of welfare.
This process will help to achieve the objective of social justice.
Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed.
The Act will further protect the interests of the underprivileged and tribal communities.
Moreover there shall be hope in the hearts of them that are humbled, that hinder the transgressions of the guilty.
No civil society can bear the injustice against women power.
The nation is not ready to tolerate the victims of sexual abuse
The Parliament, therefore, has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has been subjected to severe punishment.
You might have read a few days ago about a court in Mandsor in Madhya Pradesh investigating the case within two months and pronouncing the death penalty for two offenders who had accused the girl of sexual abuse.
Earlier, a court in Gatni in Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have quickly passed judgments in such cases.
The Act will be a mobilization in preventing crimes committed against women and children.
When we move ahead for the welfare of the country, we can transform the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time, during the rainy season, all of them together created a unique model.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of several crore countrymen has been on the Asian Games being held in Jordan.
Every day in the newspapers, television, news and social web sites, the Indian soldier has won medals.
Asian Games are now underway.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
I also convey my best wishes to the sportspersons participating in the competition.
Indias sportspersons, particularly the shooting competition and the battle competition, have achieved great achievements, but our sportspersons are receiving medals even in so many unprecedented sectors like Wushu competition and boat competition.
These are not mere medals, but evidence of the hopes and dreams of Indian sports and sportspersons.
Our women have a growing number of medals for the country, this is a very positive symptom.
In any way, among the young sportspersons who have won medals, our youth of the age group of 15-16 will be included.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
We have seen all of us building houses and buildings with bricks, but about 1200 years ago, have you imagined that a large mountain, a single mountain of rocks, a very special, broad and marvellous temple, is it all beyond imagination, but this temple is also a temple of the Kailasanath temple in all of Maharashtra.
India has been a land engineering experiment.
Many engineers have emerged in India, who have achieved what they cannot imagine and have given examples of wonders in the engineering world.
Even today lakhs of farmers and common people are benefitting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam which he had established across the river Kumaun.
In these parts of the country, he is bowed down, and the country pays respects to him.
In his memory, on September 15, we are pursuing Engineers' Day.
The engineers of our country have placed a separate stamp all over the world on the path shown by him.
When we talk about the wonders of the engineering world, one incident occurred in 2001 when a severe earthquake hit Gujarat's Kutch region.
When I was working there as a self-reliant servant, I got the opportunity to go to a village where I met a maiden who had crossed 100 years of age.
He used to ridicule me and call my house a park in Por-Kutch.
He added that this house has seen 3 groundwaters.
I've met with 3 earthquakes.
I've realized them in the same house.
But there is no effect anywhere.
Several centuries ago, the engineers of that period had constructed buildings in accordance with regional conditions, so I felt that how the people were able to live safely.
When we observe the engineers' day today, we have to think about the future.
The world is suffering from natural calamities.
Let us meet in the voice of man, let us open our minds, let us take the nation forward through our minds, let us unite.
With this feeling, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
My dear countrymen, greetings.
Even though the vastness and diversity of India is one side, rain shows its distinction sometimes.
But why should we reduce the rainfall
As a result, sometimes nature expresses its anger.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to be natural lovers, to protect the nature and to preserve the nature, that is why there will be a deterioration in the troughs of nature itself.
A natural calamity that took place a few days ago attracted the attention of the whole world and embraced humanity.
It usually takes a few hours to enter the cave.
But that day's game was different.
After they had gone far inside the cave, suddenly due to mortgage, water had stopped at the mouth of the cave.
They stopped the way out.
And they stayed in the cave for 18 days, not a day or two, on a small rock in the cave, because there was no way out.
Just imagine, when death befalls your eyes, how shall it be, that those little ones have to spend every moment
On the one hand, they were deeply hungry, on the other hand, uniting the entire human society and expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world were praying to bring these children out safely.
It is not that the parents are not sorry, nor that tears do not grow in the eyes of the mother.
And the whole world was astonished when the boys saw that they had not loosed their trust in a dark cave full of water beyond such difficult circumstances.
This is what makes us feel that when humanity stands united, miracles take place.
But it is necessary that we aim at achieving the goal of being peaceful and stable, so that there is no need to work for it.
Just a few days ago, the beloved poet of our country, Neeraj ji, had left us alone.
He has a special significance - trust, self-confidence and depression.
July-August months are the most important months for farmers and all youth.
Because these months are the peak seasons of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Sathyam come out of school and join colleges.
If February-March is for examinations, questions and answers, April-May is comfortable on holidays, and decides what business should be done to determine the direction to travel in life.
In July, the accumulation of young people goes away from questions and goes to cut-off marks, this is a very important period.
Students are leaving their homes and going to the hotel.
Students leave their parents' clutches and join them under the clutches of professors.
I am fully confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting a college life.
For the first time, leaving the house, leaving the village, leaving a safe environment, starting to drive themselves.
For the first time so many youngsters have left their homes and have come out to create a new direction for their lives.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will have to join.
Whatever I want to tell you, be calm, enjoy your inner self in life, there is no doubt that reading is important, while yourself make the nature of looking for new things.
There is a unique value for old friends.
It is a great intellectual activity that young friends are very valuable, while choosing and pursuing new friends.
Some new things can be learned, some new skills, new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new drama.
While talking about the college season, it was reported that Asharam Saudri, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, has overcome the difficult challenges of life.
He has been selected in the first attempt at the hospital's medical examination of Jethpur AIMS.
His father is working as a sanitation worker and is preparing his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
How many such students from poor families have achieved due to their untiring efforts and endeavours to overcome the worst conditions.
Their accomplishments inspire us that the father of Kushi from Nagpur is a voter in the school march, the father of Kartik from Aryaana, and the father of Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand is working in a hot brick to sell sports goods in the festival.
Likewise, Anushka Banda, a alternate woman from Kutka, was suffering from a spinal muscular atrophy...
All of them, with the help of satisfaction, destroyed the obstacles in the minds of hope, and achieved the world's return.
If we look around with us, we know many such examples.
And there is a good thing in some corner of the land, which fills the energy in my heart, and gives inspiration
When I talk about these youngsters, I am bringing your attention to the matter of water, this is the meaning of life.
Behold, I would like to sing the songs of the earth, I would like to invite both of them to the light. I would like to salute the mountains with the songs that I would like to remove the cruelty of the water from the flowers.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news report and it was written that two youngsters conscious of Modi's dream.
While studying it in detail, today our youth are trying to transform the lives of the common man by using technology intelligently and positively.
Once I was interacting with the Indian youth in San Jose City, which is known as the technological center.
I urged them to take time to think about how they can use their capabilities for India.
I appealed on how to utilize knowledge and talent to foreign countries and how to serve the motherland.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu and Rajneesh Vajpayee, accepted this challenge and took a new initiative.
Using their skills, Yogendra ji and Rajnish ji jointly created the SmartGaon App, an app for intelligent villages.
This app connects the villagers with the world and provides them with any information and information in their mobile phones.
Rae Bareli's Dudhpurvasis, Panchayat Chairperson, District Judge and District Collector all created awareness about the use of this app.
If you look at this event smoothly then we should consider that these youngsters are living in the US and living in the midst of lifestyle and thoughts.
This is the reason why we have been able to understand the requirements of the village properly and work accordingly.
The taste of achieving something for their motherland with their village and their roots is natural within every Indian.
But in some cases, this feeling is slightly restless because of the compulsions, distances and circumstances of the time, and if there is some flaw in it, this feeling is drawing itself towards the passing days.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before the audience, Varkari i.e. pilgrims are walking on a pilgrimage to Bandarpur with teeth.
This journey is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar Swamis and Dukaram Swamis are singing the footsteps of the great saints on the teeth, singing villains, dancing and composing musical instruments.
When the pilgrims are called Vitoba or Pandurangan, they come there to visit Bhagwan.
Lord Vittal defends the interests of the poor, the deniers and the victims.
Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are full of pain and devotion.
Going to the Vitoba Temple in Bandarpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all very unparalleled experiences.
I appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat that if you get the opportunity, once you enjoy the Bandarpur ball.
Number of great personalities like Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namadeva, Eknath, Ramdas Swamis, Dukaram Swamis continue to be the guides to the common people of Maharashtra.
The legacy of these great men is inspiring in every corner of India.
We have a great message of the importance of Parud songs, compassion, harmony, love and brotherhood.
The great tradition of the great saints who made their offerings at the feet of God was in our country, as well as the great men who had dedicated themselves to the motherlands of India, and made them see her again.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Tilak, who has made a seal in the hearts of many Indians.
While we are celebrating the 23rd of July as the birth anniversary of Tilak, we will observe his memorial on 1st August.
The LORD is full of courage and self-confidence.
He was filled with power and intellectuality, which directly pointed out the mistakes of the British rulers.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was greatly attracted by the tehsil of Lohman.
When Lokmanya Tilak had disappeared on 1st August, 1920, he was determined to build a memorial.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected as Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he immediately chose Victoria Cardon, who was named after the UK ueen, to set up a memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Accordingly, the British were overwhelmed by this act, so the head of government refused to allow it.
The most interesting thing is that Gandhiji, who spoke at the opening ceremony, said that after Sardar Patel took over, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a good man, but has also got a nice man, which is why he has been able to build a statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, the magnificence of this Thiruvalluvar statue is one of the most rare statues in which he is seated in the chair.
I am talking to you about the period of our years by the British.
Because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, there is a tradition of celebrating social excitement.
Our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history can be understood from this thing that even today there is a great attraction in our young society.
Today, we are able to see the bands of heroism in almost all the streets of many cities.
I would like to make a broader campaign on the specific competitiveness of the atmosphere in every city and on the MyGov and Narendra Modi App and on the environment, to be honoured and honoured.
I will definitely take your views to the people.
Every Indian, goodwill and development benefits should go away.
This will build a New India.
On July 23, 2019, another son of Mother India was born 50 years after the birth of Tilak.
He dedicated his life to relieve the freedom of the countrymen.
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
No young man of India will be inspired by these words that he inspires - "Revolution is in our hearts, we will see the power of the enemies one by one. These poems are the hymns of many young people like Ashfaqullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's resolve, independence and his satisfaction inspired many youngsters.
They risked their lives, but did not interfere with the foreign regime.
I had a great deal to visit Alirajpur, the village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I convey my memories to the two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad.
A few days ago, Hima Das, the daughter of India and the farmer, won a gold medal in the 400-meter race in the World Wars Championships held in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman in the country, has written to my letter through email from Indonesia and is now preparing for Asian Games.
"If there is a very important moment in the lives of a brave soldier, it is in the hands of a Triple Talaq on the world stage and I have done this," Ekta remarked.
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
You have glorified the land.
In Tunisia, Ekta Gold and Bronze medals were won in 2018 by the Grand Prix, a world-class hub for Tunisia disabilities.
His achievement is that he has transformed the challenge of alteration into a means of success.
Because of the road accident in 2003, even though the subordinate organs of Ekta Bayan were inactive, she did not lose the chest, strengthening herself and achieving countless goals.
In addition, one of the talented talented Yogash Kaduniya ji in Berlin has won a gold medal in the Grand Priyle, Grand Priyle, and along with him, Sundar Singh Gurjar has won a gold medal in the competition.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to Ekta Bayan ji, Yogendra Katunia ji and Sundar Singh ji for their self-confidence and dedication.
You have to move forward, play more, be happy.
My dear countrymen, in August, many events and festivals of history are one of them, but sometimes due to climate diseases also cast their legs at home.
My best wishes to all of you for the best health and patriotism this month of August and several centuries-long celebrations.
Once again we will meet at Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a historic cricket match took place in Bangalore.
All of you must have understood that I mention the text competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that this is the first international destination to participate in Afghanistan and the historic destination of Afghanistan with India.
Speaking on the occasion, the President of Afghanistan, Shri Ashraf Khani, also made a tag on me and said that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for building a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their talents.
Rashid is a representative of the important aspects of Afghanistan.
This will be unforgettable for all.
On the one hand, I consider it to be one of the most important reasons for the first time that this is memorable.
The Indian team demonstrated a description of the entire world.
We can understand the nature of sportspersons from this event.
This shows that sports is an excellent way of connecting the world and bringing out the capabilities and capabilities of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will soon play with each other in a similar way in the times to come.
My dear countrymen, when we celebrated the fourth International Day of Yoga on 21st June, the entire world joined it.
I was told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic event of Yoga was organised in which a large number of seats were made by women.
Among the highest peaks in Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China joined together in Yoga.
Some of the soldiers taught Yoga in the submarine ship
Like this, some soldiers used to study Yoga in the snowy mountain peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force, in the middle, performed Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth and embarrassed everyone.
The point to be noted is that they didn't do this as they sat on the plane, but did it floating in the sky.
Yoga exercises were conducted everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports fields.
A scene of Ahmadabadi touched his heart.
There were about 750 disabled brothers and sisters from different parts of the country who joined together in Yoga.
Yoga has done the task of connecting all the people of the world without any restrictions on caste, religion and geography, and we have lived for centuries with the feeling that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is a part of the world.
Moreover, people will make this a part of their lives.
Whenever there is trouble, we remember the doctors.
But on this day we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of doctors, I thank them.
Our doctors have made their mark all over the world because of their capabilities.
While the medical industry is capable and hardworking, our doctors are also known for resolving complex medical problems.
India is a enriched historic nation, not a day or a month without a historic event.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Makhar on 28th.
You know why Kabirdasar went to Maghar.
Pilgrim Kabirdasar put pressure on social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poems, 'Thohas'.
This was his objective.
We have this objective in his works, and in today's world it is equally visionary.
Listen to one of his tales - Kabir Choi Peer Hai, Jo Jo John Bar Peer, Jo Barber Na Janahee, Soka Peer Man Peer.
Kabir Dasar stressed on social harmony.
What is he saying in another Doha
There is sin, where there is grief and grief.
He added, Jadi Na Puchso Sadhu Ki and Puch Lejee Vanna.
Do not ask of the saints what their gods are: ask of them wisdom.
His appeal to the people is that people should be accepted and respected by their wisdom, beyond the caste religion.
His comments have been affecting even today for centuries.
Guru Nanak Dev ji, the service of the poor and the needy is the duties given to God.
Wherever he goes, there is a lot of work done for social good.
All the castes, all sections, all religions and creeds can come here and eat food. Guru Nanak Dev Ji introduced the cooking system of Langar.
Guru Nanak Devjis 550th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in this with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The war of independence of India is very long, wide, deep and full of sacrifices.
There is another history associated with the state of Punjab.
It will be 100 years since the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 2019, a demand for the shame of human society.
My dear countrymen, Raman Kumar ji from Rohini, Delhi and Dr.
Raman ji, first of all I thank you.
I am eager to see your interest in the Indian reality.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji on 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
Even though Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji addressed the convocation of Kolkata University in Bengal on the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
This is the first time that the British addressed the Convocation of Kolkata University during the regime.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industrial Minister of India and if he had said so, he had laid the foundation for India's industrial development and had laid the foundation of a strong foundation then it was not surprising.
In the first Industrial Policy of India, which was released in 1948, an unprecedented stamp of his ideas and vision emerged.
Dr.
Ms. Mukherjees dream is to make India self-reliant in every sector and make India self-reliant.
He wanted India to take full care of medium and small scale industries, industries, chemicals and sulphur industries while developing large scale industries.
During the period 1948 to 1950, he created all the Agricultural Boards, all the Agricultural Boards, Daradis and Rural Industries Boards for achieving financial and organisational base for holistic development of MSMEs.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji's contribution.
He was keen on the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellectual and positive action, a large part of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video.
There was an opportunity to go beyond the files and learn from them directly about the changes in life.
When he knew about an ordinary man... his simple words, his experiences, his phenomenon, and his phenomenon, were yearned.
Women from far-flung villages are providing services from pension to passports to senior citizens in villages through Public Service Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister has collected the paper and has been selling ice cream.
Like the Anjan Prakash of the neighbourhood, lakhs of youngsters and people of the country are doing pharmaceuticals and are getting cheap medicines from nearby villages.
School children from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important topics like waste management in their childhood school.
Throughout this programme, more than the success of the government, the success of the common man, the power of the country, the power of the dreams of a New India, the strength of a New India.
On the contrary, there are some people in the society - unless they talk about disappointment, unless they incite distrust about inefficiency, unless they seek the path of unity and not the path of diversity.
When I talk about the events that took place in their lives with simple humans, new hopes and enthusiasm in a similar environment, I don't consider this as a victory for the government.
The story of a small girl from a small village far away turns into an inspiration for 125 crore countrymen.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people joined this video bridge programme and you have given me the task of providing me a new energy.
I once again want to thank you all.
I have always seen that if we look around us, somewhere or the other, some good thing will certainly be put into our eyes.
There are people who know good.
We can also face the fragrance of good.
In the past, one thing attracted my attention and it was a very visionary link.
On the one hand there are industrialists and engineers, on the other hand there are agricultural brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Farmers associated themselves with the schemes and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Scientists and engineers trained farmers through this Trust to learn new techniques of farming and how to do organic farming and how to harvest crops other than one thousand in the fields.
Today they have not only measured the vegetables, they are selling their vegetables through this treasury and selling them at a good price, even the farmers producing grains have also linked themselves to it.
In another way, I am happy that these young people associated with the world of entrepreneurs, engineers and technicians have made their way out of their circles, join the farmers and connect themselves with the villages and work together with the fields and crops.
Friends
Your youth is really encouraging any young man.
Even other youngsters of the country will definitely visit their portal and take care of their work smoothly and they will also get inspired about how they can work in different fields of society in their respective areas.
A dream for all the people of the country, a country is conscious of the same tax.
If anyone has to congratulate the implementation of the same tax reform system, then I would like to congratulate the states as well.
Till date, 27 GST meetings have been held, a number of political thinkers are sitting in it, representatives from different states and different states with different priorities participate.
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country, but this system has been changed to only one tax.
The victory for the GST currency is a celebration of currency operations.
As the checkpoints have come to an end, freight traffic is going on at a fast pace and time is being saved and substantial profits are being made in the goods service sector.
Maybe the world's largest tax reform.
Generally, such a great reform, such a great nation, such a great population, was considered to take five to seven years to complete its full stability
This is the biggest success that the 125 crore countrymen have won.
Greetings to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Hello.
Once again, I got the opportunity to meet you all through Mann Ki Baat.
I believe that you all will remember that a group of 6 women commanders of the Indian Navy had travelled for months.
They have travelled across different oceans and many seas and crossed about 22,000 seas.
This has happened for the first time in the world.
Last Wednesday, these women met with gems and got the opportunity to hear about their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate them for their outstanding performance in promoting the glory of the navy and the greatness of the country, especially for proving that the women of India are not harmful to anyone in the world.
Nobody knows the emotional sentiment.
For centuries, the Everest cinema has been a challenge to human society, and the perpetrators have been facing this challenge.
On May 16, a group of five tribal students from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisa Turuve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Madvi, Kavithas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam, have climbed the world's highest peak.
The students of the Ashram School started their training in August 2017 at Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youths were selected as part of the Shaurya Mission's training programme
In accordance with the name, they established the pride of the nation in the Everest.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur School and my young friends.
Accordingly, India's 16-year-old Shiwangi singer, the youngest Bharati woman from Nepal who has reached Everest Sikar.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya will join the first fathers and daughters of India who have touched the Everest.
It is not that some young people are climbing on Everest Sikarth.
On May 19th, more than 50 years old Sangeeta Behl ji climbed on Everest Sikarth.
Some of those who climbed the Everest peak have shown that they have capability and emotion.
In the past days, Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, under the Swachh Ganga Movement, a team of Border Guards rode over Everest Sikar, but when they came down, they brought together dumps.
This is a matter of commendation, while this activity highlights their efforts towards cleanliness and environment.
Over the years, people have climbed up Everest Sikaram, many of whom have won.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these adventurous soldiers, especially to women.
My dear countrymen, especially my young social friends, I have never seen such responses when I talked about Fit India two months ago.
It is not even seen that all sections of the society will support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that the extent to which we are sportspersons, the country will also play in sports.
In the social media, people share fitness challenges, i. e.
Today everyone is coming together with this movement called Fit India.
It is echoed everywhere that if they are film industry, sportspersons, sports persons, soldiers, school teachers and teachers all over the world, India will be determined.
I believe that taking such a challenge helps us to keep ourselves fit and encourages others to become physically fit.
Savi Yadav ji, thank you for your phone call.
It is true that the games played on the streets were part of the lives of every child, which are coming closer today.
In particular, these sports were an important part of summer holidays.
In the course of the graduation, after dinner, children will play for hours without any concern or concern.
In some of these games, the entire family was playing and playing.
Several sports from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Katch to Kamrupam were part of the younger generation.
Yes, in different places they may be called by different names.
For example, this game, known as 7 Stones, is known by several names like Lahori, Pittu, Satholia, Digori and Sadodiya.
We can see unity and unity in these sports in the background of the diversity of our country.
One game is being known in different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat and I know about a game called Somal-Isto.
It is played in 8 x 8 square footwear with a bullet or a diamond.
It was played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka, it is called Saukabara and Athu in Madhya Pradesh, which is called Kakiratiya in Kerala, Sampal in Maharashtra, Dham in Tamil Nadu and Sangpo in Rajasthan.
I don't know how to speak in every state language, but after playing, I came to know that we have played this too.
Are there any of us that don't dress around us
It is known by various names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra, it is called Kotibilla or Karabilla, and in Odisha it is called Kulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vitthalu.
When everyone wins, when everyone plays, we can express the unique qualities that we have.
You can see that many children are fond of whispering, but when they play, they become very tired.
They express themselves themselves, they appear to be very deep, and the childhood hiding within them comes out.
How to determine the goal, how to reach the mind, how to create the feeling of the group and how to help each other.
I can see that our traditional sports are now being used in the training programmes related to business management to promote overall governance and develop mutual skills.
From children to adults, when everyone plays together, the gap between generations, it vanishes.
At the same time, we can understand our culture and traditions.
Several sports give awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be made, played in the streets and in the lanes, and they will also watch, play and grow in these games that appear to our new generations.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, India is officially organising World Environment Day celebrations.
This time the BEAT Plastic Pollution (BLASTIC POLLUTION).
I would like to appeal to you all to understand the importance of this philosophy and to avoid the use of polythene and low-cost plastic, let us try to reduce the negative impact on plastic pollution on nature, on forest life and on our health.
Enter the World Environment Day Wed-India-2018, in which many suggestions have been made in a very smooth manner - see, know and try to adapt them to your daily lives.
When there is a strong heat, when there is flood, when there is no rain, when there is no rain, everybody turns into experts, talk about global warming, environment change, etc.
Over the past few weeks, we have seen dust and strong winds blowing in many parts of the country, this is not a natural climate.
They have also resulted in a loss of life.
All this is mainly the result of the change in the weather
Our culture and our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We must live in music with nature and live together with nature.
Gandhiji brought this thing forward in every step of his life.
We will not only finish the tree but also make arrangements to maintain it until it grows and grows large.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
For the past few years, the world has again experienced the message of Yoga and harmony for unity.
Yoga is a psychological source of self-confidence and it always keeps us as father.
The feeling is that it is like their mother to the children, the peace of mind becomes our last friend.
Brothers and sisters, not only our brothers and sisters, but also our brothers, the earth, our beds and wisdom is our hunger by constantly embracing Yoga.
If all these qualities were one's comrades, the Yogi would win over all kinds of fears.
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to take the tradition of Yoga forward and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru jis memorial.
I convey my best wishes to Panditji.
In May this month, he is a hero.
In 1857, during the same month of May, our dancers expressed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the land, our soldiers and our peasants gathered themselves together against injustice, and showed their resolve.
It is a matter of sadness that for a long time, what happened in 1857 was a riot or a soldier riots.
In fact, this is not just an assessment of the event but an attempt to humiliate our self-respect and self-esteem.
In 1857, Veer Savarkar wrote without fear that it was not just a riot, but the first war of independence.
In collaboration with Savarkar, several freedom fighters celebrated the 50th anniversary of India House in London.
A specialist in managing both arms and weapons.
We will generally recognise Veer Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has always been a poet and social reformer with a sympathetic strength for harmony and unity.
I remember that Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, who is our favorite respect for Savarkar ji.
Besides being a poet of understanding, he was a bold revolutionary.
I convey my best wishes for the bright future of these ladies and sisters of our country full of desires and expectations.
If you have the courage to achieve something then you will be able to overcome all hurdles.
It is a story of some of them who dedicate themselves to fulfilling the dreams of others, who live in the slums of Odisha.
Prakash Rao is theirs.
You will be surprised to know that a simple person selling tea today is administering the evil of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He provides education, health and food to all children coming to school.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his untiring hard work, his endeavour and for giving him a new dimension in the lives of poor children.
He has removed the darkness in their lives.
Who knoweth not the word of the scripture of Damaso Maa Joshmaiah
But if one of them did it, he would be a T.
His life is a concept for all of us, society and the entire country.
And there may be things that give you such inspiration around you.
In a few more days, they will wait for the arrival of the posterity.
I believe that all of you will celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India participated.
Just imagine what kind of atmosphere is there when thousands of sportspersons from all over the world are participating.
Is there any one who cannot be affected when there is such an environment where there is enthusiasm, hope, encouragement, desire, aspirations and aspirations are fulfilled
India has achieved an unprecedented achievement.
Whether it is a matter of pride for the medal winners, it is a matter of pride for all the people of the country and the country.
Encouraging and stimulating.
We all gather together with one feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I would like to share with you all these sportspersons.
For the first time, many things have happened in this regard.
This time all the warriors participating in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Batra has come across medals in all the sports she has played.
He is the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in the Table Tennis Stadium.
India has got a lot of gold shooting competition.
India's only Para Power Lifter won a medal in the Sachin's Saudri Commonwealth Games.
Moreover, if the competitions were special, the majority of the victories were women.
Woman boys played very well and showed their talents with skulls, bullets, gunshots and gunshots.
The final contest of the Bhubaneswar is a two-wheeler of India - Saina Nehwal and B.
V.
It was also held between Sindhu.
I was asking you to join Fit India and come for leadership.
I am glad that people have joined it with great enthusiasm.
Many have written letters to express their support for this, and are sharing important issues related to their physical strength and Fit India information in the social media.
One of them, Sasikanth Ponsle, shared the picture he took in the swimming pool, and wrote, My body is my weapon, water, my own, and my world is swimming.
Do you know what Ruma Devnath has written I feel happy and healthy after the morning walk
For me there was a smile of smoke and when we were happy, we had to smoke.
After seeing all these things, it is good that many prominent people are also giving inspiration to our youth for Fit India in the most interesting ways.
The film star, Akshay Kumar, has given a video on the dwarf.
His other video is also very popular, in which he can see his hand and play with the people.
Many youngsters are sharing their experiences by connecting themselves with Fit India initiatives.
Your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the elderly, men and women, should make efforts to connect with Yoga.
You must have been deeply imagined how to enjoy holidays and where to go.
I invite you to do a new job today
I can see many youngsters spending their time learning something or the other.
The significance of summer training is increasing, youngsters are engaged in this schedule, and training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, one gets the experience of living in a new dimension by crossing the books and calculations.
My young friends, I urge you to take a special training.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - Department of Sports, Department of Human Resource Development and Department of Drinking Water, Government of India have jointly organised a Swachh Bharat Summer Exercise 2018.
You must go to MyGov website and register yourself for the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I believe that our youth will take this movement forward for cleanliness.
Send yourselves to you, and send your photographs, and comfort yourselves.
Come on
Let us create an opportunity to learn in this holiday.
Just a few days ago, the youth of Delhi were betraying something about some of them in Gud News in India, who are serving the poor children as a lesson.
These youngsters have stepped up a massive campaign to educate the street children of Delhi and children living in slums.
This innovative activity began because the condition of children who were begging on the streets or working on retail jobs supplied them.
The movement started with 15 children in the slum area near Gita Colony in Delhi today, connecting 2000 children with them at 12 locations in the capital.
Young people, teachers and entrepreneurs associated with this movement have been trying their best to make changes in the society by spending two hours in their daily schedule.
Brothers and sisters, just like this, some farmers of Uttarakhand have become a source of fervor for the farmers across the country.
Because of their integrated efforts, they have not only enriched their position but also the future of their region.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, particularly in the field of malaria, poultry, maize and parlia are being cultivated.
As a mountainous region, the farmers did not get the right price for this
They had set up a cooperative organization in Munnar village, where they had set up a factory to prepare biscuits.
Considering the mindset of the farmers, the administration has linked it with the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being added not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres in Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the earnings of this organisation have not only reached 10 to 15 lakh rupees per day, but it has also created employment for more than 900 families and people have also been forced to leave the district.
Everyone talks about this, but don't we have the duties
Didn't we feel that water conservation is the responsibility of society
This must be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Our ancestors have been implementing this thing for centuries.
They have given priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They have discovered new methods and have found out how to save every drop of water.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit Tamilnadu, you might have noticed that there were large pools related to water conservation and drought management in some of the temples there.
In Mannarkodevi, Cheranmadevi, Mandirbhadra and Tirthankaras, large poets are found everywhere.
Even today, we must not forget that various stakeholders are known as tourist destinations and are still living examples of our ancestors about the water conservation mission.
In Gujarat, Adalaj and Rani Kiwav in Patan have been declared as the world heritage site of the UN Education, Science and Cultural Organisation.
In the months of April-May, June and July, we get a very good opportunity to save rainwater, as much as we are ready before.
Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme (MGNREGS) is being spent on water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, efforts are being made on their own with the objective of water conservation and water management.
32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme every year.
In order to talk about 2017-18, about 55 of the total cost of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management.
Over the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by these water storage and water management.
7000 people working under this scheme have worked hard in seventy days and revived the river Kutteberur in Kerala.
Ganga and Yamunotri are water-filled rivers, but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers Sasur and Kadheri in Fadebur district have dried up.
The district administration faced a huge challenge in land and water conservation activities under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, these dried sasur and Kadheri rivers were revived.
Have you ever seen such a great achievement of silver, birds, peasants, agriculture and villages
Once again I urge you all to take up some responsibility for water conservation and water management, and we will devise some schemes and we will achieve something.
My dear countrymen, before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have news from all sides, letters and phone calls from all sides.
Ayan Kumar Banerjee from Devitola village of North 24 Burgana district in West Bengal has recorded his views in MyGov - we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, but many people have not known the theory of Rabindranath Tagore who won the Nobel Prize.
Please talk about this thing in Mann Ki Baat programme, which will give people an opportunity to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was a complete form of wisdom and wisdom. His writings have made an impossible mark in the minds of all the readers.
Rabindranath is intellectual, diverse, but we can enjoy that every moment an editor was alive within him.
'He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students,' he wrote in his lecture.
I was not aware of the Bengali language, but I used to wake up early in my childhood and radio broadcasting in Eastern India would start soon and start late in western India.
Anandaloke, Ahuner, Boroshmoni, when these poems are heard, there will be great inspiration in the mind.
Rabindra Sangeet and his poems must have lived with you.
My dear countrymen, in a few days, Ramlan will start in the holy month.
The month of Ramallan is celebrated with full pain and respect throughout the world.
The social side of Nonbin is that when a man is hungry, he feels the hungry of others, when he is thirsty, the feeling of the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the message and teachings given by the sovereign Mohammad Nabis.
We learn from his life only to travel through the path of equality and brotherhood.
And once a man asked the sovereign, saying, It is very important to know what happens in Islam.
The sovereign brothers and sisters, whether we know or not, whether we know them or not, should be harmful to everyone, he added.
Sovereign Mohammad believed in wisdom and compassion.
Mohammad Nabi has said that if something with you is more than your requirement, give it to the needy man, therefore, in the month of Ramallan, more importance has been given to the monkey.
People pay tributes to the poor during this holy month.
The words of the sovereign Mohammad Nabis, that no man is a wealthy man because of his own pure soul, and not of his wealth.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb gave power to millions of people on the brink, including those who were humiliated, oppressed and oppressed by the Constitution.
There is no better example for Karuna.
Buddha was one of the greatest qualities of Buddha Buddha's penance in the ruins of the people.
In many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, the method of Buddha is linked with their roots.
This is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for tourism, which connects the important places of Southeast Asia with the best pious places of India.
Today there are conflicts and misery in all parts of the world and the path of elimination of Buddha's teachings by compassion.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the devotees of Lord Buddha, all those who believe in compassionate principles and all others across the world.
I salute the entire world from Buddha, through which we can fulfill our responsibility to create a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
You must have heard of the idols of the laughing Buddha, but some people know that this laughing Buddha will gain luck while talking about these things, but some people know that Buddha is associated with an important event in the security realm of India.
You can imagine what is the link between Buddha and Bharat Soldiers, which is the backbone.
A new self-confidence has blossomed with the Indian diaspora spread all over the world.
That day is also a Buddhist pavilion.
On May 11, 1998, India conducted a nuclear test in Bokarn, Rajasthan on its western border.
India's experiment was successful, in a way, India was able to fulfil its potential in the field of science and technology.
And it came to pass on that day, in the history of India, that the power of our armies was engraved in golden signs.
Lord Buddha showed that the power of Andrama is essential for peace.
Likewise, today if we are strong as a nation, we can be peaceful with all of us.
That day we showed the world that India is capable of achieving new goals and acquaintances every day under the strong leadership of the Earth, the land of great scientists.
We can see the new joy and new joy that Atal ji had launched.
My dear countrymen, once again we can join the Mann Ki Baat, we will talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the day of Ram Navami.
On this auspicious day, my best wishes to all the countrymen.
Every moment of his life, we were able to see how much the power of 'Ram Ram' was in the life of the mother of the divine mother.
During the last few days, on January 26, all the leaders of the ASEAN Organisation came here and brought the Cultural Council with them.
It is a matter of great pride that most of the countries have given Ramayana before us.
It means that Rama and Ramayana are not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of the world.
I once again convey my best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, this time, all your letters, emails, telephone messages and comments have been received in a big way.
You have heard about the introduction of online readings in Gomaldaker ji MyGov and I read it.
It is heartening to see the attraction of the estimation sector.
I have told you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I appeal to all those who listen to Mann Ki Baat and all those who are engaged in the work related to Samskrit, to advise you about how to implement Gomal jis idea.
Kanshyam Kumar from Barkar village of Nalanda district (B) of Bihar, I read the comments he wrote in the Narendra Modi App.
You are concerned about the fall in the ground water level, it is a matter of great importance.
You have also asked for drinking water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I bring your feelings to all the lovers.
Does he know what Yogesh Bhadresha ji had said This time he is asking the youth about health
He considers our youth to be physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, this time I want to talk to everyone about health - a healthy India.
Youngsters, all of you can work together towards a healthy India movement.
In the past days, the President of France visited Kashi during his visit to the country and the sights of the journey were all fascinating and impressive.
I urge you to lure them, re-doubt and bring them to your friends.
They have written to me their thoughts on the gratitude cards found in the back of my book, Anaka, Jayesh and many more children, Exam Warrior.
I would like to tell Anaka, Jayesh and all the children that when I saw your letters, all the tiredness of that day disappeared like a iceberg.
If I could read so many letters, so many phone calls and comments, I could hear, many of these things are in my heart.
I have to say only about them for months.
This time most of the letters have been written by children and they have written about the examinations.
They are sharing their holiday projects.
They have expressed concern about the water for animals and birds in the summer.
Letters have been received from farmer brothers and sisters regarding the functions of farmers across the country regarding agriculture.
There have been positive suggestions from some citizens regarding water supply.
Our festivals, our culture and our traditions have been observing in the festivals.
That is, the things of mind are changing according to the weather and the truth is that the voice of our mind has changed the climate of life of many.
Why not change
In these aspects of yours, in your experiences, in these examples, this zeal, so much energy, so much harmony and the taste of doing something good for the nation.
These have the potential to change the environment and environment of the entire nation.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I came to know how a Rickshaw driver from Kareemganj district of Assam, Ahmed Ali, had built 9 schools to study poor children with his deep will.
13 years ago, due to lack of proper timely treatment, the sister of Kolkata's taxi driver, Siddle Laskar, is dying.
In his mind, he was determined to build a hospital so that no poor person can die because he cannot get treatment.
Siddul sold jokes at his house to achieve this goal and collected money on his own.
Many travellers travelling on his taxi paid their money in a smooth manner.
An engineer sister himself paid his first month's salary.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of money, Siddle Laskar's familiar efforts were made.
Today, due to his hard work, a hospital with 30 beds is being prepared in Pune village near Kolkata due to his satisfaction.
Such incentives are introducing and recognising my country.
Today, when the name of India is pronounced with utmost respect, the unparalleled acts of this mother India's wealth are embodied.
Today, everybody has this belief in the minds of the poor and the middle class of the country, of the youth, of the women, of the backward, of the poor
We can move forward and progress can be achieved by our country.
A self-confidenced and positive atmosphere has emerged.
It is this self-confidence that this positive feeling will fulfill our dream of a New India and embrace our satisfaction.
My dear countrymen, the next month will be very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
That's why a lot of letters have come to agriculture.
This time when I see the video of discussions with farmers in Kisan Channel for the farmers of Dordarshan, I feel that every farmer should connect himself with the DD Kisan Channel of Dordarshan and see that the benefits shown there should be implemented in their fields.
Be it Gandhiji, Lal Bahadur Sastri ji, Lohia ji, Saudri Saran Singh or Saudri Devi, all have considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and the lives of the people.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Sastri used to talk frequently about the importance of trees, plants, vegetation and the importance of the special agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that a massive public awareness should be made to ensure that our farmers have excellent income, special irrigation facilities, and to increase the production of food and milk.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhary Saran Singh ji called upon farmers to use new technologies and create innovations and strengthen their needs.
I had visited the Agriculture Development Festival in Delhi in the last few days.
Interacting with farmers brothers and sisters and scientists there, I had a comfortable experience in knowing, understanding and knowing about the innovations related to the agriculture sector.
But the thing that has affected me is the hard work of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This low-lying area has done a great job.
In 2015-16, our farmers of Meghalaya have achieved an achievement in Magic compared to the last five years.
If the goal is determined, if the motivation is full, the motivation is deep, it can be achieved and fulfilled.
Today, technology is also handing over to the farmers' hard work, which is why there is considerable strength for the farmers.
Brothers and sisters, in this financial statement this year, a massive resolution has been taken to provide affordable prices to the farmers.
Besides, the work on agricultural marketing reforms in the country is going on at a rapid pace to get the right price for the farmers' produce.
Efforts are being made to link rural markets, gross markets and world markets in the village.
The APMC and e-NAM base will be coordinated while the farmers will develop and develop the necessary infrastructure for 22,000 rural markets across the country, which is unnecessarily far-flung to sell their produce.
In a way, connectivity with any market of the country is being created from the field of agriculture.
My dear countrymen, this year is the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Our satisfaction is Swachh Bharat. Besides this, how can 125 crore countrymen share their shoulders with Gandhi Ji in a very special way
Can we organise new events
Can we create new ways
I appeal to all of you to share your views on this through MyGov.
What might be the symbol of Gandhi 150
What the fuck can be
Write to me your comments on these things.
Today, in the health sector, the entire country has crossed the usual approach.
All the health related services in the country were previously responsible for the Ministry of Health, but now all the departments and ministries - be it Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or State Governments - are all working together for a healthy India, with sickness health, there is no greater pressure on low cost health.
Disease prevention health is extremely costly and very simple.
The more we are aware of the disease prevention health, the more the individual, the better the family and the better the society.
The first need for life to be healthy is cleanliness.
We all pledge to be a nation, as a result of which health care has doubled to nearly 80 in the last four years.
Besides, a wide range of work is being done in the direction of setting up health centres across the country.
As a healthy conservation of diseases, Yoga has created its identity throughout the world with a new energy.
Yoga guarantees both physical and health.
This is the result of our efforts, so today Yoga has become a mass movement, it has become a part of every household.
The next International Day of Yoga is still less than 100 days left for June 21.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people have participated with great enthusiasm in the country and everywhere in the world.
This time we will also ensure that we inspire Yoga, Yoga, Family, Friends and All of us.
It has to be further popularised in the handling of new incredible methods, children, youth and senior citizens.
Further, television and electronics across the country are providing various programmes related to Yoga throughout the year
But from now on till Yoga Day can we create awareness about Yoga as a mission
My dear countrymen, I am not a yogi.
But some people have transformed me into Yoga Yoga Yoga through their creation and I have produced three-fourths offerings like Yoga.
A widespread effort is being made to ensure that health care is accessible to all, cheaper and easy for the common man.
Today, more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
Moreover, new centres are being opened.
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat - to the people who are required to come here with information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras.
This will be a great service to them.
Heart stent prices for heart patients have been reduced by 85 percent.
Fees have also been fixed and reduced from 50 to 70 percent.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Suraksha Yojana, about 10 crore families, that is, about 50 crore citizens will be treated and 5 lakh rupees will be spent for the family in a year.
The number of medical seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS hospitals will be opened in many states to provide special treatment and health facilities to people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts.
By 2025, the target for the country to get rid of tuberculosis has been set.
Today, Make in India and Make in India are successfully operating in the country.
On that day, Dr. Ambedkar ji had dreamt of becoming an industrial power and his vision was inspired by all of us today.
Today, India is rising at a bright spot in the world economy, and FDI is coming to India, the largest FDI in the world.
The entire world has turned India into a hub for investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had a firm belief in self-sacrifice.
He didn't want any man to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he didn't think that their poverty would be averted if something was shared to the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India initiatives, innovators, entrepreneurs and youth from our young society have been created.
Today, historical efforts are being made regarding the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being developed at various coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in old ports.
Most of the 40 debates meant the 2nd World War, the emerging Cold War and the partition of the country.
During that period, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone for the spirit of Team India on one side.
He spoke of the importance of the federalism and stressed the need for the Central and State Governments to work together for the progress of the nation.
Today, we have accepted the mantra of cooperative federalism and cooperative federalism in all aspects of administration and competitive federalism.
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is a vision for crores of people like me from the backward classes.
He has shown all of us that there is no need for a big family or a Seeman family to move forward, and that the poorest of the poor families in India can dream of, that dreams can be realised and success can be achieved.
But the picture of a New India is completely different.
I would like to urge you to participate in this movement with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals in the next few days like Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Anuman Jayanti, Easter, Paisakhi.
It is a day to remind us of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, his sacrifice and sacrifice.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, who gave us the message of Ahimsa, will inspire us all.
Mahavir Jayanti greetings to all the countrymen.
Whenever there is talk of Easter, the inspirational instructions of Esunath will always be remembered and the messages he has given are human peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion.
Paisakhi Utsav is celebrated in April and West India
On the same day, Jute Shield and Sathuvain in Bihar are celebrated with joy and joy in Assam, Bihu in Assam and Boila Paisa in West Bengal.
Once again my best wishes to all of you for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat Feb 2018
At the beginning of today, I am launching Mann Ki Baat with a telephone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science and some have written letters.
Even if the colour of the sea is blue, we all know that there is no color for the water because of our daily experience.
Have we ever considered the river, and the sea, why are you colored
The same question emerged in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose was given to eminent personalities, which is called Boson.
A few days ago, the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence (WATWANI) was participating in the launch programme in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science.
This artificial intelligence is aimed at creating robots, botts and specific functioning machines.
Today, the machines are doing their intellectuality even more sharply through machines.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can be helpful in making the lives of differently abled brothers and sisters easier.
Can we know more about natural calamities through artificial intelligence
Can we help farmers in the field of crops
Can this artificial intelligence facilitate healthcare delivery and help in detection of diseases through modern methods
A few days ago, I had gone with the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I Create Project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There he produced a young and digital device
The young man said that if those who are unable to speak through this tool, then the tool makes it a voice, and it does as one interacts with each other.
I believe that in such a way we can use artificial intelligence.
Scientific and technologies have a neutral value.
They have no self-esteem.
Any machine will work as we wish.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered Light Bulbic, had failed in many of his experiments.
Once asked about this, he said, I have discovered ten thousand methods of how I cannot produce lit bulbs.
That is, Edison has turned his defeats into his own power.
Today, I am in Auroville, the land of Maharishi Aravind, not only an accident but also a great deal to me.
As a revolutionary, he was a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them, and raised many questions opposing the regime.
As a great rishi, he raised questions against every angle of life.
He also discovered the answers and showed the path to humanity.
The feeling of clarifying the truth and raising questions again is important.
This is also the true hypothesis at the back of the search for scientists.
Why shouldn't we live till the answers are unknown to such questions
I convey my best wishes to our scientists and all those associated with science on National Science Day.
Rabindra Singh from Pune has written about Occupational Safety in the NarendraModi App.
He said that the security standards in our country are not so good in factories and in construction.
On the 4th of March, the Prime Minister has asked the people to talk about security in their hearts, so that awareness about security can be felt in their minds.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one being careful and the other being ready.
Defence is two types, one is important in times of disaster, the other is essential in everyday life.
It is difficult to achieve this situation in the times of disaster if we say that we are not aware of security in our daily life and are not safe.
These words will often benefit us in our lives.
When we see the natural calamities, the majority of the people are consequential to something wrong.
If we are awake, if we follow the necessary regulations, we can save our lives and save our society from the greatest problems.
We might have seen a number of words written in our workplaces regarding security, but we have seen that they are not following.
I urge them to train once a week or once a month in schools with any municipality and municipality.
There are many natural calamities in this country and the disasters that we have experienced in the field of chemicals and industries.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the country's disaster management.
Self-help activists have been trained in flood-hit and cyclone-affected districts and are also given the name of the victims.
Two to three years ago, thousands of people were survivors due to the heat wave.
After this, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) organised training graduates on the safety of the heat wave and launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
The contribution of all was a good outcome.
The number of catastrophic casualties in the year 2017 is lower than expected to be around 220.
If we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We must become a society with caution against danger.
We have often undertaken flights and provides safety related references at the beginning of the airplane.
Well, was there a system of information
This is how we have experience in every sphere of life.
My dear countrymen, this time, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, wealth from waste and energy from waste has been emphasized in villages through natural gas.
The initiative taken for this purpose has been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources, i.e. integration of bio-agricultural resources.
The objective of this Cobber-World Mission is to make the villages clean, animal feed, farm crops, fertilizer and natural gas, through which wealth and energy are created.
Some European countries and China use cattle feed and bio wastes for energy production
But India is not fully involved in this sector.
Under the Rural Scheme of Swachh Bharat Mission, now we are progressing in this direction.
It has been decided to improve the production of natural energy through livestock, cultivation and cooking habits.
Under the Kobar-Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India should be encouraged and they should not only see food and waste but also see them as a wealthy nutrition.
There will be new employment opportunities in waste collection, transportation and natural gas sales.
The Kobar-Dhan Yojana will be implemented in a smooth manner by setting up an Internet Business Place which will connect farmers with buyers and make the right price for farmers' crops.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about many festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival and Film Festival.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, where the first Kuppi festival of the state was organized.
Raipur's excitement and other districts also hosted dust festivals on their part.
Each one of them shared innovative ideas on cleanliness, debates and organised poetry.
There was an atmosphere like a festival that was centred on cleanliness.
In particular, school children participated with great enthusiasm, this is a wonderful thing.
I extend my warm greetings to the residents of Raipur, to the people of Chhattisgarh, to the government and government administration of Chhattisgarh on the occasion of this festival in a very integral way to promote waste management and cleanliness.
We are celebrating 8th March every year on International Women's Day.
A lot of events are organized in our country and around the world.
Women who have performed models in various fields in the past days have been honored with the Nari Shakti Puraskar on this day.
Today, the country is moving towards a progress made by women across the gap of progress.
On this occasion, I am reminded of Swami Vivekananda's Gold.
Today, it is our duty to ensure that the contribution of women in every sphere of social and economic conditions is equitable.
Today our women power is expressing their self-confidence and self-confidence in their actions.
It is our dream of a New India where women are empowered and partners in all kinds of development of the country.
In just 20 days, from 26th January this year, these women have constructed 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets and made a precedent, including about one lakh women groups.
The women from the neighbourhood of Jharkhand have shown that women power has the potential to transform it into the nature of the masses by strengthening the cleanliness drive and cleanliness in the lives of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, I knew how happy they were among the three villages of the Elephanta Islands when I was watching the news two days back.
I was surprised to know that despite being such an important tourist destination, even from Mumbai, for so many years after independence, electricity has not reached there.
For 70 years, three villages of the island of Elephanta - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthabundar - were darkened and lighted from the lives of people drowned in darkness.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
What else can be the time for enjoying and enjoying the lives of the countrymen, the happiness and happiness of their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, just a few days ago we celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
In March, the Green Cooking Treasures, the beauty of the harvesting crops, and the floral flora for the heart, are the special features of this month itself.
At the same time, the Hollywood pandit this month is closer to ourselves.
The festival of Holi will be celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the country on 2nd March.
How important is the colours of the Holi festival, so important is Holika Dakna because on this day we pour out all evil in the fire.
Forgetting all the differences, the Holi Festival of Holi gives a very good news, the moment of unity and brotherhood that participated in the happiness of each other.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripathy ji has written a long letter in the Narendra Modi App, asking me to talk about all the things in it.
On the 1st of February, Kalpana Chawla visited the space.
Though they are not with us today because of the Colombia Space Square, they have been inspired by the youth around the world.
In this context, I express my gratitude to Prakash for introducing his letter to Kalpana Chawla ji on the day of his death.
It is a matter of great sadness for all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age, but they have left the message that there is no limit to women power in the whole world, particularly for thousands of women of India.
It is a matter of great pleasure that today in India women and every sector are moving forward immensely.
In our country since dawn, respect for women, honour for them in the society, their contribution has made the entire world surprising.
It speaks in detail about the importance given to women in our society.
That is why they themselves have given the status of power to women in our society
It shows that the wisdom of people like Lopmudra, Karki and Maitrei, the wisdom of Aka Mahadevi and Meerabai, the valour of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of Rani Laxmiba, and the strength of women, has inspired us, and the pride of the nation's honour.
Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples.
Our Raksha Mantri Shri Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Indian Navy led by Vartika Joshi in the INSV TARINI Club has inspired him to fly in the airspace at Sukoi 30.
Three detailed women like Bhavna Khand, Mohan Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become combatants and they are conducting the training of Sukoi 30.
You're absolutely right.
Today, women are not only moving forward in all sectors but also leading them.
Today, for the first time in many sectors, the achievement of women-power is being understood and a milestone is being established.
In the past, the President has taken a new initiative.
Our President met a group of extraordinary women who had achieved the first time in their fields.
These women accomplishments of the country, the first woman captain of cargo ships, the first woman driver of the passenger train, the first woman bus driver, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, and the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman in every field has achieved extraordinary achievements by eliminating the conservative pillars of our women and society.
They have proved that with the help of drastic hard work, endeavour and affirmative strength, all barriers and difficulties can create a new path.
On this path, they are not only the people of their time but also the people of the generations.
And they have filled a new zeal, and a new spirit.
This book has also been written about the achievements of the women and the first women to know about these women powers and to get inspiration through their lives.
This book is available in the form of e-book today in the form of NarendraModi App.
Today, the significant contribution of women's power to the positive changes in the country and society is bright.
Today, while we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention about a railway station.
You can imagine what could be the link between a railway station, womens empowerment.
All the employees of Madunga Railway Station, Mumbai.
This time, after watching the Republican Festival, many of the people in Divers and other social networks are particularly concerned about the bicycling section of the Border Police Force, all of them are women.
And they understood the things that were comfortable, and this witness surprised the guests that came from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women power is leading.
Self-sacrifice is emerging.
The wonderful work done by our tribal women of Chhattisgarh has come to my attention and they have given a new example.
While talking about tribal women, there is a decisive scene in everyone's minds, there are forests, roads, women carrying heavy weight on their heads.
But our tribal women and women of Chhattisgarh have created a new sight before the nation.
Chattisgarh's Dundewada region was beat up by Maoists.
The Maoists have created a terrible climate here for violence, repression, bombs, guns and gardens.
In such a terrible environment, tribal women are becoming self-sufficient and self-sufficient rickshaws run by battery.
Besides, there is also a strong link to environmental protection.
I also congratulate the government administration here and have contributed a lot in the backdrop of the success of these women from their financial support to their training.
Abandoning the prosecution, adapting changes to the required.
For centuries, continuous efforts have been made in the country individually and socially against social destruction and destruction.
A few days ago, a tasty initiative was undertaken in Bihar.
A human chain programme of more than 13,000 kms was organised in the state of Bihar to root out social evils.
Through this movement awareness was provoked against evils like child marriage and dowry atrocities.
All the people of the state had resolved to fight against dowry atrocities and child marriage.
Children, adults, enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters, all of them came forward and joined themselves in this movement.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, this human chain has been long, uninterrupted, uninterrupted, uninterrupted and uninterrupted.
If all sections of the society get the benefits of real progress then our society should get rid of these evils.
Together we will make all these evils disappear from the society
Let us build a New India, a powerful and powerful India.
Over the past few years, people have been writing and writing to me about this matter.
I have seen several photographs and social media about the beneficiaries of this scheme.
It gives me this thing that he has got the darshan and he has got the idea of getting it for others.
The objective behind this programme is to facilitate smooth functioning of healthcare and ease of living.
The price of pharmaceutical medicines is 50 percent to 90 percent less than the drugs traded.
This provides economically beneficial benefits to senior citizens, especially medicines that can be used for the common man, which will increase the savings.
The generic medicines purchased here, that is, similar types of medicines are in accordance with the standards of WHO.
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has set up more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi medicines across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at affordable prices and entrepreneurship has also created new employment opportunities for individuals.
Price medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana, are available at Amrut shops in hospitals.
The only purpose behind all this is to create a quality and affordable healthcare for the poorest of the poor in the country, thereby creating a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra is sharing a photo in the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
The photo attracted me a lot.
One of them, along with his grandfather, participated in the 'Morna River Cleaning' movement.
The citizens of Akola have taken up the task of cleaning the river Morna in this Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Though the river Morna is a river that can grow for 12 months, it has now become a monsoon.
Another thing that travails here is the flowers and waterfalls in the river.
I was told that this cleanliness drive was launched on 20th January, 2018 and this movement will continue every Saturday morning till the river Morna was completely cleaned.
This shows that if one decides to make an attempt, one cannot afford it.
The massive changes can also be brought about by the mass movement.
I convey my sincere congratulations to the people of Akola, its district and municipal administration, and all the citizens who have participated in the Jan Andolan for these efforts.
My dear countrymen, the President is also interacting with Padma Awards to be conferred on the occasion.
Newspapers and television are attracted to it.
But it is a matter of great pride for you when you see a little nutritious and it is a matter of great pride for us that we have great pride amongst us and that we have no recommendations and awards without any recommendations.
Now it is not necessary that a person should be popular, but his actions are identified as him.
He has been manufacturing sports goods from dust for 40 years, thereby creating scientific zeal for children.
His efforts have been to ensure that children do scientific experiments through useless materials.
For this, he goes to 3000 schools all over the country and is encouraging films made in 18 languages.
Look at a wonderful life, a great dedication
It is like this that the life of Sitava pair of Karnataka is also like this.
There is no point in calling her 'Girls Empowered Devi'.
He has played a very important role in changing the lives of countless women for the past 30 years.
From the age of seven, he sacrificed himself as a goddess, and laid down all his life for the good of the gods.
Moreover, no one has ever worked for the welfare of the underprivileged women.
You might have heard about the people of Bajju Shyam from Madhya Pradesh who were born in a very poor tribal family.
While he did simple work for his livelihood, he had a terrible country on traditional tribal artwork.
This is the reason why he has a value not only in India but in the whole world.
His paintings have been shown in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, UK and Italy.
He has been honored with Padma Shri awards for his talent and his talent showcasing India's name abroad.
You can be surprised to know that the lives of the tribal women of Kerala are easier for you.
Laxmikutty, who works as an editor in the Kartar region, still lives in dense forests and tribal settlements in a hut driven by paneyola.
After snake bite, he has been selected for the drug production.
Laxmi ji is continuously serving the society through his herbal medical knowledge.
He was recognized and awarded Padmashree for his contribution to society.
Today, I want to talk about one more thing, and the 75-year-old Subhasini Mistri Ji of West Bengal has been elected for the award.
Subashini Mistri ji washed utensils in many households to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospital produced by his hard work is providing free medical treatment to thousands of poor people.
Sometimes we should take such people to schools and colleges and share their experiences.
Crossing all the awards, the society must make some efforts.
My dear countrymen, every year on January 9, we celebrate the occasion of NRIs.
On the same day, Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate an inseparable bond between India and the Indians around the world.
This year we organised an event for overseas Indians, in which parliamentarians and mayors from all over the world were invited from India.
In many countries like Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States, wherever immigrant Indians are mayors and parliamentarians, all of them participated.
Some of them have portrayed Indian literature in various fields such as Internet Safety, Ayurveda, Music, Poetry, Climate Change, and have made a sign of self-reliance.
Some have been tractors, some have built blind people, some have built mosques, that is, wherever we are, they have somewhat destroyed all the countries.
I express my gratitude to the people of the European Federation for recognising the excellent work of the overseas Indians and for their remarkable service to both the wars around the world.
In today's era, we see how true the teachings of the mother are.
What else can we do to him if we decide to go to the mother's house
My dear countrymen, by conveying my best wishes to all of you for the year 2018, I get a reply from you.
Throughout the year, we have shared many things.
The exchange of letters, ideas and ideas for Mann Ki Baat has always been a new force for me.
A few hours later, the year will change, but our shares will continue as usual.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
Best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Just a few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated the Christmas festival as a hub.
We can also see the essence of service mentality in our literature.
This shows us what is the significance of service mentality.
In our country, we are talking about the disgusting act, that is, there will be no expectation of reflection of such activity.
It is said that Seva Paramodaam means service is the best root.
My dear countrymen, this year is the 350th year of Guru Gobind Singh's birth.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a lecture on the great values of life and values and lived all his life on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a poet, a philosopher, a great soldier, has done the task of inspiring people through all these contributions.
He launched a war against repression and injustice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in personal life.
But he never gave up his mind for mentality at any time.
Every moment of life, he gave a message of love, sacrifice and peace.
Have you seen such an enormous speciality
I got the opportunity to participate in the 350th Birth Anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh at Patna Sahib earlier.
Come, let us all try to improve our lives by learning from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his visionary life.
Whoever was born in 2000 or was born in the 21st century, they would start becoming voters eligible for voting in 2018.
I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India in the democratic form of India.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters and I appeal to all of you that you all go and register yourself as voters.
India stands for you as a voter of the 21st century.
A positive change in the lives of lakhs of people is a great impact on the vote.
You cannot be powerful only to vote.
Today, in my heartfelt joy, I would like to talk about our valuable young society of 18 to 25 years of age, which is full of satisfaction and energy.
I consider them NEW INDIA YOUTH, the youth of a New India, the youth of a New India, the youth, the zeal, the energy.
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be realized by the talent and talent of our powerful youth.
When we talk about a new India, a new India should be free from casteism, religiousism, radicalism and corruption.
It must be free from uncleanness and poverty.
Everyone should get equal opportunities in New India, everybody's aspirations and opponents should be fulfilled.
In New India, peace, unity and harmony should be our guiding forces.
My young Indians, come forward and study how to build a New India.
Young people from the age group of 18 to 25 can sit together and exchange ideas about a New India, find ways and plans
How to fulfil our resolutions before 2022
Can we consider the dream of our freedom fighters to build India
Gandhiji transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement to create a higher India of the 21st century, which is a mass movement for progress.
How to achieve success through stress
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created before the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are emerging and successful.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken of the importance of Positivity and positive thinking.
There is a case in English - Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
Let us share the positive moments of 2017 and we will welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am glad that a large number of people have made positive responses to the social infrastructure, the MyGov website and the Narendra Modi App.
Positive India hashtag has also made lakhs of toilets, which has gone up to more than 150 crore people.
In a way, the spread of honesty has spread the entire world from India to India.
The incoming two-wheelers and answers are truly hypocritical.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some people of the country have mentioned some of the events this year that have caused a positive impact on their minds.
Some people share their personal achievements.
My name is Meenu Batia.
I live in Packet One, Face One, from Mayurvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
She wanted to read.
I needed loans for this, I got it very easily and my daughter was able to pursue studies.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I'm staying in the box.
My husband had made a monthly risk of paying a rupee.
Unfortunately, he lost his life.
We are aware of the worst situation we faced at that time.
We got a lot of benefit because of the government's help and we were able to cure something.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our BHINNAR was constructed through BHINAR village from 2017 to National Highway.
Because of this, our roads have become very good and our business has started to grow.
My name is Deepansu Ahuja, and I live in Sadatganj in Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish.
Over the past 40 years, we have been dependent on the army's drainage system.
Now a water pipe has been constructed for us alone...
This is our great achievement of 2017.
There is a positive change in the lives of a large number of people due to many of their activities.
In fact, this is the New India, and this is what we are building together.
Come, with these little joys, let us start a new year, from Positive India to Progressive India - from a positive India to a positive India.
When all of us talk about positive ideas, I also feel like sharing a thing.
I have heard about the story of the inspiring story of Anjam and Bashir Khan, who have been selected in a very excellent manner in the State Governance Examinations of Kashmir.
He has emerged from the bailout of terrorism and cow slaughter and has been a prominent figure in the state's regime's election.
You will be surprised to know that in the 1990s the extremists have burnt his old home.
When extremism and violence were carried out, his family was forced to leave their forefathers.
He has not forsaken our confidence.
He set a path for himself - the path of service to the people.
He came across adverse conditions and finished his failure.
Today, he is an inspiration not only for Jammu Kashmir but also for all India.
Despite the worsening of the situation, the agency has proved that through positive actions, the dissolution of disappointing clouds can be dissolved.
Last week, some women from Jammu and Kashmir got the opportunity to meet.
The thoughts that I spent with those women, which inspired me, this is the strength of the land, these are my young wealth, this is the future of my land.
Thousands of devotees come every year to this coin, which is world famous for the blessings of Ayappan.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how to transform cleanliness into a culture, how to find a way to solve the problem and how to make people's contribution powerful.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, started an action plan called 'Punnyam Gardenvanam' and started a cleanliness drive to nurture awareness about cleanliness.
With this kind of improvement in Sabarimalaya, this Punnam Garden Mission has become a part of every Yadrikar's journey.
There is also a strong resolution of cleanliness with difficult hurdles.
My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we have taken a resolution.
He laid down his life for this work and made efforts.
On the 150th birth anniversary of his brother, we had decided to dedicate to him the India of his dreams and to make our contribution in that direction.
Efforts are being made in the direction of cleanliness across the country.
There is a widespread transformation in rural and urban areas.
The worlds largest survey of Swachhta Survekshan 2018 is scheduled to be conducted from 4th to 10th January, 2018 to mark the level of cleanliness in urban areas.
The study will cover about 40 crore people in more than 4000 cities.
The Survey provides a comprehensive comprehensive measure of innovative initiatives taken in the field of Open Defecation in cities, collection of waste, processing of waste, processing of scientific waste, efforts to transform, capacity building, innovations for cleanliness and peoples participation in this work.
According to this survey, different groups will go to cities to study.
Talking to citizens, they will get answers from them.
They will examine the use of Swachh App and the development of various types of service centres.
It is also considered that the cleanliness of the city has been created by the cities to make the city natural for the people.
It is not just the government to implement cleanliness.
It has a huge share of every citizen and civilian organisation.
On the basis of this analysis, if your city has a population of more than one lakh, if the country has a population of more than one lakh and if it has a population of less than one lakh, it will also be a part of the quality.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one thing with you through this programme.
If anybody wants to travel to Haj, then it has been brought to my notice that he cannot go without 'Mahram' or his male guardian.
When I heard about this for the first time, how can it be so
Why did all this discrimination appear.
Over the years, injustice has been done to Islamic women, but no discussion has taken place on this.
Such a regulation does not exist in many Islamic countries.
But this right has been denied to India's Islamic women.
I am glad that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken necessary steps to end the tradition that has continued for 70 years and has removed this control.
Today, I am glad that even without a male guardian of Islamic women and 'Mahram', this time 1300 Islamic women have applied for Haj without men and women from different parts of the country.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has been instructed to ensure that all women applying for separate travel are allowed to travel to Haj.
I am confident that India's development journey is progressing through the strength of our women power and their intellect, and further progress is going on.
Our sustained efforts must be made to facilitate the rights and opportunities of men and women, and they will also grow equally in the path of development.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January we all have historically important occasions.
However, the coming year will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
India will be the chief guests of the 10 countries of ASEAN in the Republic Day celebrations this year.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering.
This has not happened so far in the history of India.
In 2017, ASEAN was an important place for India.
The ASEAN concluded its 50-year term and in 2017 it reached 25 years of Indias alliance with ASEAN.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that on 26th January these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will participate here.
It is rare that there will be no pundit on a day.
Now we have celebrated the Christmas Festival and the next New Year will be born.
May the coming New Year bring immense joy, happiness and fulfillment.
Let us all move forward with a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new zeal and a new resolve.
In January, the time of sunrise will be celebrated in this month.
This is a combined period of nature.
In fact, every festival of ours is connected with nature in some way, but in our culture of diversity, there is a habit of celebrating this wonderful event of nature in different ways.
If Lohri's joy in Punjab and Northern regions increases, there is a confrontation between Kitchen and Tilkanth in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Mag-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamilnadu - all these have their own specialty, which has a unique significance.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January.
What is the theory of their sovereignty, although they are different in the name - the link between nature and agriculture.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on this occasion.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September 2019
There is no doubt that there will be any Indian citizen who does not respect him.
He was older than all of us, and witnessed in different stages of the country and in different times.
Not only from our new generation but also from all of us, this is a great learning experience, you all are the greatest hypnotise for us, even after you have done so many achievements in your life, you have always been the chief source of your parents' nurturing and dedicated behavior.
This feeling is very nice to me.
I don't really want to give you any problem.
Why, I know how much you're doing, I'll see how much work you're doing.
Moti ji: Yeah.
Moti ji: Because of your love, we are very happy.
Moti Jesus: I have thanked me also for your continued observation above me.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on my best birthday.
Moti ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I wanted to talk to you.
We will celebrate countless festivals like Navaratri Mahotsav, Karba, Durga Puja, Dasra, Deepavali, Paiya Duj, Satpuja.
In many cities, many NGOs and youth start-ups are engaged in this work.
They coordinate all the clothes, sweets and food items in the houses of the people and bring them in search of the needy and do this without any advertisement.
This time, in this season of festivals, can we drive the darkness in the light with full awareness and satisfaction
And the smile of the faces of many poor families shall double your joy in the feasts, and your face shall be more bright, and your light shall be even more shining.
My dear brothers and sisters, on the occasion of Deepawali, the shrines are welcomed in the house to provide a lot of love and abundance of life.
We welcome the sages traditionally.
Would we welcome the monks in a new way this time
In our culture, we salute women in the form of silver because women are regarded as gifts and fulfillments.
Can we organise programmes in our society, in our villages, cities, in order to honour women
You can organize public events, because of their hard work and hard work, the achievements are amongst us, among our families, in our society, in our country.
Can we organise programmes to honour and value these monks of India during this Diwali
Women who have done many extraordinary jobs may be amongst us.
Some doctors, engineers and poor children may have been engaged in some social service in teaching education.
Prosecutors may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society must identify such women and be proud of them.
Just as all of us have driven a mobile mission with our daughters all over the world, we will intensify the movement called Bharat Kee Lakshmi.
Incentives to the people of India mean ensuring a full life of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had already said about the voice of Mann Ki Baat, that is why I get the opportunity to interact with many people who are not familiar with this.
In the past days, Alina Thayang, a student in far-flung Arunachal Pradesh, wrote to me an interesting letter.
I belong to Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
Some people asked me if you were reading the book by the Exam Board when my results came.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I read this book and read it again 2-3 times.
After this, my experience was very sweet.
My daughter-in-law, thanks for writing a letter.
And thank you very much for telling me the grievances therein while studying.
I'll follow your command.
What is your experience in life according to your day
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend and student Alina Thaiang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you might be aware of the uninterrupted events of the Prime Minister of India through the newspapers, TV, and you might have been discussing about the absence of satisfaction.
This time, however much was spoken about the victory in the US Open, Medvede's speech, which was the second in the final race, was also bitterly spoken.
I also heard a more spoken speech on social websites and then watched the dance.
It was only 23 years since Dann Medvede's simplicity and passion for all.
If there were others at this time, he would have been sorry and disappointed, but he had no rhythm in his face, but through his words he smoked everybody's mind and livelihood.
The audience greeted him on a large scale.
In one lap, the zeal of the lord and the wisdom of the victorious were puzzled.
If you don't listen to Medvede's speech in Dan, I especially appeal to the youth, please go and listen.
There are a lot of things to learn from all sections of the society and all the elderly.
These moments are beyond success and there is no point in victory failure.
Life succeeds and our essays show us this thing in a very special way.
The idea of our ancestors is really surprising.
Mani Kanjana Samyog: Janayati Lokasya Lohasan Anandam: If a person has a qualification and work together, then no one can win his heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I am talking about this thing for your direct benefit.
But in the beginning, if we are awake and prevented them, then it can be very safe.
I want to tell this feeling in mind, especially to the younger community.
It becomes very difficult for you all to know that smoking is very bad for the health.
Those who use tobacco have a greater danger of cancer, diabetes, blood pressure.
It affects the growth of brain by its consumption in childhood .
But today, I have come here to share a new thing with you.
You know, the e-cigarette has been banned in India.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic apparatus different from ordinary cigarettes.
The e-cigarette contains nicotine liquid, which produces a sort of chemical smoke, which involves nicotine.
We all are well aware of the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but misinterpretation of e-cigarettes has been widespread.
It means that there is no danger from this E cigarette.
Since there should be no foul smell like other cigarettes, they add a sweet smell to it.
If a father smokes in a house, we might have seen in our neighborhood that he will not smoke others in that house, he would like to say that his children should not have the habit of smoking like himself.
He will try not to smoke in his family.
He was aware of how much ill the body would suffer from smoking and use of tobacco.
He smokes as soon as he is caught, and he is well aware of this.
But this is not the case with e-cigarettes.
People have no such awareness about e-cigarettes.
They don't fully know the danger, so sometimes the e-cigarette enters the house quietly.
In fact, E-cigarettes have been mixed with numerous infectious materials, which will have a bad effect on health.
If anybody in the neighborhood smokes, it will only betray us.
The dreams of every family should not be trampled on foot.
Deliver the habit of smoking, do not take any wrong opinion of e-cigarettes in your mind.
Come, let us together build a healthy India.
Yes, you don't remember Fit India.
Fit India means there is no need to go to Jim for two hours in the morning.
It is also important to stay away from these things.
I believe that you will not feel bitter about what I say, but it will definitely happen to you.
And they sacrificed themselves for the rest, and not all lived for themselves.
One such gentleman is to be honoured in Vedican on October 13.
Christmas tracia, in its 50-year-old short life, is an example for the entire world in the interests of human society.
He had an important role in the field of social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of great pride not only for India but also for the entire world today that while we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore countrymen have been able to utilize their lives once and for all.
In the direction of environment protection, India is leading the entire world in a way and today the vision of all the countries is dependent on India.
I am confident that all of you will participate in the mission of relieving usage of 2nd October at the same time.
In many places people have been contributing to this movement in their own ways.
However, the youth of our country has organised a very vibrant movement.
When I was concentrated on his work, I photographed him and tried to find out about his new test.
For the first time when I heard of this word plogging, this was new to me.
Perhaps this word can be used more in foreign countries.
My dear countrymen, I am Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to you.
If 130 crore countrymen take a step in this direction, India will move 130 crore steps in the direction of emancipation from single-use emissions.
Once again, my best wishes to you.
Greetings on behalf of you and your team for such a new imagination.
Dengue.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working on the 2nd of October, but we want to travel on the path of 150 Gandhiji.
We want to bring about a change in the values of the country in our lives.
I would like to remind you of something earlier.
Even if I talk about it in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, why don't I talk about it a little earlier today
You all remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was born.
Thousands of children, elders, all schools and colleges, and millions of villages of India, we must drive for unity on that day.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had spoken from the Red Fort and I had asked you to visit some 15 places in India by 2022.
At least 15 places, at least one or two nights will have to stay there.
Once again I appeal to you, please visit some 15 places in India, because people are definitely going around while holidays are coming on the occasion of Deepavali festival.
And all this has happened because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all for various festivals in a diverse India.
A few days ago, there was a possibility of television with young friends from the state of Karnataka.
The Times team's 'Vijay Karnataka' newspaper published a paper on the children, in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
In that journal they published some selected letters.
When I read those letters, they were good for me.
Kirti Hekde, from Northern Karnataka, congratulated the Digital India and Smart City programme, while expressing keen interest in learning about the need to transform our education system, and in today's era, there is no country for children on classroom studies and they are keen to know about nature.
If we provide information about nature to the children, they will be able to enhance natural security in the future.
Reida Nathaf, a child from Lakshadweepera, has written that she is the daughter of a soldier and is proud of her.
When you are the daughter of a soldier, there is no wonder that you will be proud of him. If Irfan Bakam from Kalpurki writes, his school is 5 km from his village.
Friends, I am glad that a newspaper has taken such a initiative, these letters have come to me and I have got the opportunity to read them.
This was an experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is 26th November.
In 1949, it was today that the Constitution of India was adopted in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution of India is the spirit of our democracy.
Today is the day when we remember the members of the Constitutional Assembly.
They have been trying to remove the Constitution of India for three years.
Those who read those discussions, how their dedication to the nation in those discussions was.
Do you know how hard they will work for our nation without a constitutional framework of diversity
And when the land was freed from slaves with understanding, and with vision, they did it.
It is the duty of all of us to build a new India by following the light of this Constitution and keeping in mind the clear ideas of those who have given the Constitution.
Our constitutional law is very vast.
There is no aspect of life that is not found in it, but is not a matter of nature.
It is our obligation to pursue a letter of the Constitution.
Be it citizens or rulers, we must move forward by understanding the feelings of the Constitution.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any role to play.
It is natural to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day today.
17 different groups were formed regarding the enormous issues of the Constitution.
The draft group is one of the most important groups.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the draft constitution.
He was well-known in an important role.
Today, we are experiencing the pride of giving the Constitution of India, and in its creation Babasaheb Ambedkar's destructive leadership has been posted.
He ensured the benefits of all sections of the society.
On the 6th of December, he will be remembered and paid homage, as always.
And it shall be remembered that Babasaheb's participant in making the land self-reliant and mighty.
On the 15th of December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was his immortal day.
Ethias Sardar Patel has done an extraordinary thing to make the country one of the poorest of the poor.
Sardar was also a member of the Constitution.
He was a member of the Advisory Council of the fundamental rights, minorities and the tribals.
Even though 2611 is our Constitution Day, how can this country forget 2611 that happened 9 years ago
The nation remembers and pays homage to the brave citizens, police, security forces and all those who are alive.
Neither forget that this land is their sacrifice.
Terrorism is spread all over the world today, something or the other is happening day by day, and it is being done in a terrible form.
We have been defeated by terrorism for the past 40 years.
Our innocent people have lost thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, while talking about India's radicalism on the world stage, many people in the world did not take it seriously while expressing the fears of radicalism, but today when terrorism lays down their patriotism, the world governments see the biggest challenge of terrorism.
This is aimed at destroying humanitarian forces.
Therefore, not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world must unite and defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhi Ji have given this soil to the world of non-violence and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are engaged in a terrible effort to weaken our society and make it a symbol.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to be aware of humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of December we will celebrate the Naval Day.
The Indian Navy is protecting our coasts.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all are aware that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Our rivers, oceans, oceans, economy and warfare are important both from the River Sindh, Ganga, Yamunotri and Saraswati.
This is our entrance to the entire world.
Their navy had a huge share in the expansion of the Christian empire and its economic enormousness.
Several examples of the naval invasions and analysis of the Christians are still present in the literature of the Union.
The vast majority of the world's navy had allowed women in war operations for a long time.
But about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played a crucial role in the navy of Christians.
Women were also involved in the war.
The Church regime had technologies related to shipbuilding.
When we talk about the navy, can we not talk about the opening of his navy, President Sivaji Maharaj
Sivaji Maharaj ji was dominated by the occupied Kongan coast.
Several fortresses associated with Sivaji Maharaj's empire, Sindhu Durga, Murud Janjira, Swarna Durga were located in the seashores or surrounded by the sea.
Marathi army is responsible for the security of these forts.
The Maratian navy included large ships and small ships.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
Can't you talk about the Marathi navy and talk about Kanoji Angrey
He took the Marathi navy to a new shrine, setting up Marathi navy bases at many places.
Sumitra, immediately engaged in rescue operations, saved many fishermen from being drowned and delivered them to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka in May this year, three ships of our ships reached there immediately and marched to the government and people of that country.
In June, when the Papua New Guinea government sent an urgent report to us, our navy helped protect fishermen from their fishing boats.
Our navy has always been proud of the country, to provide medical assistance to the country, to provide immediate relief and to provide humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring countries.
We have brought respect, respect and pride to our security forces, the courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers, the sacrifices of our soldiers, the sacrifices of our soldiers, the sacrifices of every citizen.
125 crore countrymen have a reliable life because of the soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the country.
Every year on December 7, we will observe the flag hoisting of soldiers.
This week, they shall lay the flag on everyone as small and big.
A movement to assess the soldiers in the country will be launched.
On this occasion we can distribute the flags of our armed forces.
This fund is being spent on the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of the martyrs who have sacrificed their lives in the war through the welfare of the soldiers.
You will be able to know about the various ways of economic partnership.
Come, let us use this opportunity to enhance the spirit of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of December is World Soil Day.
I want to tell some things to our farmer brothers and sisters.
All the food we eat is linked to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Just imagine, if this prosperous soil that is required to manufacture is not in this world then what is it that you think
How can human life be possible without planting trees
How do you get the brilliance
The farmers of this country are giving a lot of importance in their lives to the two subjects of devotion to soil and respecting it as a scientific age.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that our farmers of the country are connected with traditions and are innovative towards modern science and are empowered.
When I went to the battleground of Dohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
The farmers have used chemical fertilizers beforehand, which has affected the soil.
After the massage was reduced, income was reduced and gradually the productivity of the soil was starved.
In 2016-17, the cultivation of cold crops increased by 3 to 4 times per acre, and the income from each acre increased by 4 to 6 thousand rupees.
Not only this, there was improvement in the quality of the soil.
The lack of fertilizers resulted in economic savings.
This has given me great pleasure and my farmer brothers and sisters have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them in the soil health cards.
If we have to pay attention to the mausoleum then first we have to take care of the earth and if we take care of the Earth then this earth will take care of us and we will start understanding the farmers brothers.
Our farmers across the country have more than 10 crore soil health cards, so that they can properly understand their land, so that they can sow it.
We bow down to the earth, but have we ever seen how much damage it is due to putting urea on her
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that there is a severe impact on urea on Earth.
How can a farmer bear the burden of illness when he is the mother of the earth
It is compulsory for the time that this mother-father's relationship has to be alerted once again.
Can our farmers, the sons of our soil, the mammals of our soil, if it is 75 years since independence in 2022, can we ensure that the urea they use will be reduced by half
We have started to experience global warming and climate change.
Before Deepavali, there was a time to start a Cold Gavid.
But even in such circumstances, some examples of the consequences that Saddam has always been awakening.
An 8-year-old boy, Dushar, who had an alternative power in Madhya Pradesh, has tried to get his villagers out of open defecation.
And the eight-year-old child could not speak, but he had his arms to seek.
And he rose up at 5:00 in the morning, and went to the house of his village, and sat down, and raised them up, and set them up by signs, saying, Do not waste water in the open.
The Kumbhri village was freed from open defecation due to which 30-40 houses went every day and provided education for cleanliness.
This miniature is engaged in the work of inspiring Dushar.
This shows that I have no age for cleanliness.
Whether it is small or large, whether it is women or women, cleanliness is essential for everyone, it is essential for everyone to contribute towards cleanliness.
You may recall that our talented sportspersons have won 4 medals at the Rio Olympics, and have won the T-20 World Cricket for Observers.
Various competitions are going on throughout the country.
Over the past days, 17th National Water Contest was organised in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters who came from different parts of the country, took part in this and expressed their talent.
One of them is the 19-year-old gigger ducker of Gujarat, who does not have muscles in 80 percent of his body, but look at his essence, mind and labour.
As a result of this, he will be trained in the Centre of Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat as one of the 32 Para Swimmers selected for 20-20 Paralympics through the Sports Commission of India.
I convey my best wishes to the younger Jigar Ducker.
Today, special attention is being paid to the approach and opportunity of the differently abled.
A few days later, Eid-e-Milat-Un-Nabi will be celebrated.
He was born this day by the sovereign Hasrat Mohammad Saheb.
My dear countrymen, I am Jayeja Singh from Kanpur.
I would like to appeal to you that you will again share ten very good things with us from the voice of your mind throughout this year.
Woe to the elders in our villages for ever and ever to forget grief, and forget not comfort.
We look at the past in the year-to-year calculations, we indulge in the turmoil of ideas, and we indulge in the next year's plans by slashing their decisions.
We are once again trying to remind us of the interesting events of last year in the media.
There is also a positive thing and a negative thing.
But in the year 2018, when we take a step, cant we remember only good things, do we engage in good deeds or remember them
I would like to tell you all that if you have heard and shared the 5-10 positive things that you have experienced then there is no feeling of good.
Can you contribute in this
Can we share 5 positive experiences in our lives this time
I invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a sustainable environment with the help of photos, scriptures, short films and so on.
Let us recall the events that inspire others.
We will bring good things to mind and create a better environment.
Good things provide the necessary strength to do good.
We will combine the strength and impact of this joint drive together.
In my next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely try to bring the things that have come to your Positive India to the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I will return to you in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat next month.
There will be a lot of opportunities to diversify.
The sacred day of Deepawali celebrated after 6 days is one of the festivals celebrated with many appointments and regulations.
Traditional appointments are persuaded in every matter what to eat and what to do.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also linked to this festival.
Before Satpura, the entire house is cleaned, as well as the cleanliness of the rivers, lakes, water bodies, worship places and holy places.
Solar Alleviation or Sat-Pooja is a celebration of environment protection, disease prevention and regulation.
The feeling of destruction of mankind is at the back of this tradition of seeking reproduction and this evil character can be a major obstacle in the path of progress.
It is natural that this great tradition of India can be proud of all.
My dear countrymen, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is also commendable and critical.
Let us take the example of gates and handcuffs.
It is a pleasure to hear that only a shop has so many sales.
Approximately 680 percent growth has been registered in Kadi Pension sales before Deepawali.
Nearly 90 of the total sales of cargo and crafts are seen.
This shows that today youngsters, elderly and women are wearing doors and handloom clothes.
I can imagine how much good it will be for the families of the poor, the poor and the families of the handicapped people.
You must share my Deepavali experience among the security forces and tell me how they celebrate the festival of Deepavali.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great joy.
In my case, this time also Deepawali had a great experience.
Once again, we got the opportunity to celebrate Deepavali with our enormous security forces on the border.
This time Deepawali was an unforgettable experience with the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Kurez region.
Our security forces are protecting the country by facing so many difficult and difficult situations on the borders, for that struggle, dedication and sacrifice, I salute all the people of our country from the side of our security forces.
Whenever we have the opportunity, whenever we have the opportunity, we must learn the experiences of our security forces, we must listen to their adventures.
Many of us may not know that our security forces are engaged not only in our border areas but also in many important tasks to maintain peace throughout the world.
He is a peacekeeper and is proud of India all over the world.
For us, we are going to follow the theory of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, a family all over the world.
India has always been putting pressure on women's equality.
This can be a small change in the best practices, but it shows nutritious ideas.
If I say that India's greatest contribution is in terms of its various tasks then it will be an integral part of the country.
India has always played a positive role in the UN peacekeeping operations.
By August 2017, the soldiers of India have served in about 50 operations across the world in 71 peacekeeping operations.
These activities have taken place in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan in all parts of the world.
In Congo and South Sudan, India's military has provided treatment to more than 20000 patients through medical services.
Some people know that India is the first country to send the first female police force to Liberia through the UN peacekeeping movement.
This activity of India is a vision for all the countries of the world.
Only then did all the countries start sending their women guards.
It is a matter of great pride for all that India's contribution is not only with peacekeeping activities, but also for training those who are engaged in peacekeeping operations of around 85 countries.
Our peacekeepers from this land of Gandhiji and Gautam Buddha have brought a message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping activities are not an easy task.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
He lives in different people.
We have to understand the various environments and different cultures.
We have to change ourselves in accordance with regional situations and environments.
When I think of him, the cheeks of all the people of the country are very proud.
In 1989, 72-year-old man was appointed the Force Commander for his operations in Namibia, who dedicated his services in ensuring the independence of Namibia.
India has always been giving messages of peace, unity and harmony in the world as an ambassador of peace.
While he was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
Nivedita means complete dedication.
In the following period, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday is the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was very impressed by Swami Vivekananda and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita suffered mentally due to injustice in the British regime.
The British did not only slave our country, but they were trying to keep us as slaves in mind.
Keeping our culture dirty, the work of creating a sense of humiliation in our minds continued.
Sister Nivedita re-established the dignity of Indian culture.
He used to raise the awareness of the nation and unite the people.
He went to various countries of the world and voiced his voice against false propaganda on the theory and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramania Bharati has explained in her revolutionary poetry about the New Year and their synthesis.
It is also said that the inspiration for this song was received from his sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita has also helped in the massive scientist Jagdishchandra Bose.
He has collaborated through his columns and conferences to publish and spread Bose's analysis.
One of the most beautiful features of India is the concluding of a spiritual and scientific one.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose have a special example of this.
In 1899, there was a horrific Black Disease in Kolkata, killing tens of thousands.
Sister Nivedita inaugurated the work of cleaning the canals and streets, not to take care of her health.
He may have lived comfortably, but he was engaged in the service of the poor.
Inspired by this sacrifice, they began to contribute to the service of the people.
He taught the lessons of the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is very surprising to hear that children also suffer from diabetes.
In the past, such diseases are called monarchy, which means that such diseases are rich and sustainable only for those living.
Such diseases were rarely seen in young people.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are a lifestyle problem.
One of the main reasons for such diseases in young age is the reduction in physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in the dietary system.
It is also very important to focus on social and family.
If you look at these things, you will feel that there is no extraordinary need to do anything.
We should naturally make our old habits alternately and do small things in accordance with them.
Children should be aware of the habit of playing in open grounds.
If possible, the elders of the family can join the games along with these children.
Instead of using the elevators, children can have a habit of climbing up the stairs.
After dinner, everybody in the family can walk a little closer to the children.
Yoga is extremely beneficial in creating a healthy lifestyle, especially for our youngsters.
You will feel how much benefit you will get before starting your school for the first 30 minutes.
If I say that it is easy then it can be easily learned and why is it very simple then it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for specific equipment or ground.
Yoga is very useful in controlling diabetes, many researches have been conducted in this regard.
A study is being conducted at AIIMS and they are very encouraging in keeping with the decisions that have been received so far.
We will not only see Ayurveda and Yoga as medicines but also make them parts of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been many good news in the past few days in the field of sports.
It is because our soldiers have played a very good role that after ten years we have been able to become Asian winners.
Earlier, India had won Asia in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to all the wearers and all the helpers and to all the people of the country.
After Hockey, India has also got good savings in the game with badminton.
Petminton star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open and made India proud.
After the Indonesia Open and Australian Open, this is the third super-series premiere victory.
I convey my sincere congratulations to our young sportspersons, to this achievement they have made and to make India proud.
Friends, this month the FIFA started World Cup for 17-year-olds.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their talent in the field of footwear.
I also got the opportunity to see a laugh.
Sportspersons and visitors were encouraging.
The world is watching the great event of World Cup.
When we saw such a great laugh, the strength of all the youngsters, the zeal and the thirst of the accomplishment, the joy of the joyous ones, the joy of the joy.
The world started successfully and all the teams showed their talents very well.
Even though India could not succeed, the young sportspersons of India also won the blessings of all the people.
All the countries of the world, including India, enjoyed this great festival, attracted and clarifyed the audience with their footsteps.
Symptoms show that the future of football is very bright.
Once again I convey my best wishes and congratulations to all the sportspersons, their helpers and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, when I look at the number of writers about Swachh Bharat, if I have to respect their feelings then I would like to dedicate the voice of every mind to cleanliness.
Some are sending photographs about the efforts of small babies and some are sending information about the efforts of the youth.
In some places, there is a news of some innovation related to cleanliness or the changes made by an officer's attempt.
In the past, I have been given a comprehensive report on a revival story in the Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra.
There, a non-governmental organisation named Ecological Protection Organization, was engaged in cleaning Chandrapur fort through its entire team.
In the 200-day movement, without any satisfaction, they were engaged in the team work and were working to clean the fort.
A series of 200 days.
Your disappointment and confidence will change as soon as you see this.
This is a unique example of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, beauty, social activity and interconnected efforts.
The fort is a symbol of our tradition.
The responsibility of protecting and cleaning the historical traditions belongs to all of us.
I offer my best wishes to the Ecologist Protection Organization and their overall wearing and sandalwood citizens.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of November we will celebrate Guru Nanak ji's birth anniversary.
And Guru Nanak God was not only the first guru of the Sikhs, but also the guru of the world.
He spoke of the interests of the entire human society, and sinned all castes equally.
He stressed on empowerment of women and respect for women.
He gave the message of establishing equality in society, not just with words, but also in his work.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has given three messages of livelihood that can help those who need the name of God.
Guru Nanak Dev ji passed a sacred book called Guru Grand to take up his teachings.
We will be celebrating 2019 as the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Let us move forward on the path of his teachings and messages.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel will be celebrated.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's specialty is that he is not only a manifester of the idea of change, but is capable of implementing it and dismantling it as a very difficult problem.
He was an expert in the implementation of the idea.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel accepted the great responsibility of connecting India with one hand.
At the outset, he ensured that crores of countrymen should be brought under the umbrella of One Nation One Constitution Act.
He was able to pass all barriers to his ability to make a resolution.
Sardar ji's message still remains a fool of our New India's dream and is suitable today.
That is why we observe his birthday as a National Integration Day.
His contribution in giving a coordinated form to the nation is unacceptable.
On 31st October, Sardar ji's birth anniversary, a movement of unity is being organised across the country, in which many people from all over the country, children, youth, women and all age groups will participate.
I urge you too to participate in this run for unity and join each other's concert.
My dear countrymen, after Deepavali holiday, with a new determination, with a new determination, you must have begun to revive your everyday life.
My best wishes to you all for the realization of your dreams.
Three years have passed since I started talking to you through Mann Ki Baat in Akashwani.
Today, 36th.
In a way, there are allegations of India's positive power, feelings, desires and expectations in all corners of the country, but in some places, I have given my heartfelt opportunity to interact with the feelings of the people.
You might have noticed that I have never said this as the voice of my mind.
Everything you send to me is available from email, telephone, mygov and narendraModiApp.
Sometimes, individual-related grievances and sometimes social problems are attracted to attention.
Once a month, I take about half an hour of yours, but people have been sending me information about the voice of Mann Ki Baat for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time.
I have always been reminded of the words of the spiritual vision Bhave in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Thereafter, I received a lot of letters from everywhere in the country and told me that many social organisations and many young people are engaged in the work of eating waste.
While watching, it was a great movement not only in India but also with daughters from all over the world.
This is not the problem of social media.
Every girl has become a new self-confidence and a new pride for her child.
Every mother's father had to take a cell with her daughter.
There is a feeling that every woman has great significance.
In the past, I have participated in a tourism department of the Government of India.
Wherever you travel, I asked the travellers to send me photographs of Incredible India.
Millions of films were still in India's limestone, in a way it became a great wealth for those working in the tourism sector.
Every moment the country is on the right track.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something positive for the welfare of others, for the benefit of the society, for the progress of the nation.
In this three-year movement of Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt and understood from the people of the country.
This is the biggest capital for any country.
Gates sales have increased, which has resulted in increased employment in poor households.
There is a substantial redundancy in the papers from 2nd October.
Once again I urge you to take forward the movement related to doorsteps and further strengthen it.
When we buy the gates, we have to keep in mind the feeling that the Deepawali Pillars will shine in the houses of the poor.
This is why we have to do this thing for the poor of our country.
With increasing interest in the doorsteps, there has been a new incentive and encouragement to those working in the field of papers, to those associated with gateways in the Government of India.
How to introduce new technologies, how to increase productivity and how to introduce solar equipment.
How to revive the tradition that has been hiding from us for 20-30 years
In Uttar Pradesh, the Sewapuri Kadi Ashram in Sewapur, Varanasi has been closed for 26 years, which has now started functioning with a new dimension.
That is, we had decided that on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti 15 days prior to 2nd October, we will celebrate cleanliness throughout the country.
We will unite people's minds through cleanliness.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, unveiled the plaque to mark the commencement of the nation.
Today, all the elderly children, men and women, cities and villages are connecting themselves as part of this cleanliness drive.
I had promised and said that this cleanliness drive is moving in the direction of success with the help of our determination and is spreading in front of our eyes.
Everyone is making it suitable for them, they are helping them, and they can contribute to achieving this.
All the sportspersons, film personalities, academicians, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, workers, police and soldiers are connecting themselves with this movement.
There is a kind of pressure that people ask for cleanliness in public places if they are filthy and there is a need to keep them clean.
This time I had to look into another thing - cleanliness is one thing, it is another thing that we do not waste from awakening.
At the same time, it is important to transform our mindset into cleanliness.
This time several competitions related to Swachhta were held.
More than 12 crore children participated in the column.
Thousands of children took their imagination, and drawn portraits.
When we talk about cleanliness, I don't forget to express my gratitude to the media.
They have taken this movement forward with utmost hygiene.
They have contributed immensely towards creating a positive environment by connecting themselves with each other.
We are witnessing the great service of our country's electronic media and newspapers to the Swachhta Hi Sewa Movement.
A few days ago, someone told me about the 18-year-old youth from Srinagar, Bilal Dar.
Asia's largest lake is near Srinagar, in which he used plastic, polythene, bottles and dustbins.
He also earned from this.
Since his father died of cancer, he added his life to cleanliness.
Billa Dar is an incentive and factor for all those who are young and interested in cleanliness.
The month of October is a month to remember many of our great personalities.
On the 2nd of October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11 Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji on the 25th of September.
Nanaji and Deen Dayal are centuries this year.
During his centenary celebrations, when Nanaji Deshmukh ji shunned his political life and connected himself with the Gramodhai movement, it is important to pay respect to his work on Gramodhi.
While speaking to the youth of Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, Nanaji Deshmukh ji will always put forward the issues of rural progress.
He will also describe this with immense respect and went to the villages to see these works of Nanaji.
Like Gandhiji, Deendayal Upadhyaya will also talk about the man in the lap of society.
Deendayal will be reminded of how they can transform the lives of the poor, the vulnerable, the underprivileged and the deprived.
If we think of all these great men, it is not a comfort to them, why do we think of these great men then we will find a way to go ahead.
A massive movement of this solidarity should take place in every city of the country and the weather is comfortable. It is necessary to get iron like Sardar.
Is not Sardar unifying the land
We must also participate in this movement for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We naturally say that unity in diversity is India's achievement.
While we are proud of diversity, did you try to experience this diversity
I want to reiterate to the people of the country, particularly to the younger generation that we are alive.
Enjoy the diversity of our India, feel it, face its gate.
You can see that this diversity of our country will be a school for the uniqueness of yourself.
There is a feeling of going somewhere on the day of holidays, on the day of Deepavali, on the four sides of our country.
People from North India do not know what is in South India.
He is not aware of what is in Eastern India.
Do you know how many diversity lies in our country
If you listen to the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam then one thing will be seen - when they look around India, they understand India and dedicate their lives for that.
All these dignitaries have seen India completely.
Before their operation, they tried to know and understand India.
They tried to see India living within themselves.
Can we not try to learn, understand and live as a student of our various states, different communities, groups, their habits, their traditions, their ancestors, their food and their beliefs
And it is the value of tourism that we understand and turn into a student.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
The dream of a united India is a comparative India.
How many types of food
If you have every kind of food every day in your life then there will be no chance of eating the same food again and there are so many types of food.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
During these holidays, you should leave your house and not stop, we are going for change, you should go out with the aim of knowing things.
Your life will be fulfilled through these experiences.
Your outlook will be large.
Tell me, who could be greater than your experiences
If you go this time too, will you take this movement forward
Wherever you go, share your experiences and share photos.
Definitely send your photographs to Incredible India.
If you meet the people there, send their photographs.
There is an idea in my mind - to encourage the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven most important tourist destinations in your state - every Indian should know about those seven places in your state, if possible, go to those seven places.
With the help of this, can you provide some information about this
Can you reveal this in the NarendraModiApp
Can you know this in Incredible India
I would like to tell the government that if many of the people of a state say this thing then I would examine this thing and know about the 7 locations that have been reported in every state and publish advertising cards on them.
In a way, how can tourist destinations be taken forward with the views of the people
Similarly, you can imagine that the places you have visited in the country, whichever is of great importance to you, the rest of you must visit, visit here and get information about these things. You must send them to the NarendraModiApp without MyGov.
Come, join me.
During this period from October to March, you can become comfortable in encouraging the tourism sector of the country.
I'm calling you.
My dear countrymen, as a man, many things are touching my mind.
I too am a man like you
The incident that took place in the past may have brought your attention - the countrymen must have seen the magnificent description of women power and patriotism.
The Indian Army has got two heroes - Lieutenant Swachhata and Financial, which are extraordinary heroes.
Why am I supposed to be extraordinarily extraordinary, those who lost their lives in the service of Bharatmata are the husbands of both Swadeshi and Finance.
You imagine how their minds would be when the world swells at this young age
But Martyr Col Santosh Mahadik's wife Swati Mahadik confronted such difficult situations and strengthened her mind and joined the Indian Army.
For 11 months, he joined the army with a hard training and made himself conscious of his husband's dream.
Likewise, Financial Dubey's husband, Mukesh Dubey, served as the hero in the army, survived his mother's work, and his wife, Nizam Bunder, joined the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will have respect for our mother power and our heroes.
My dear countrymen, between Navratri Utsav and Deepavali, the youth of our country has got a great opportunity.
FIFA (FIFA) is going to be a world cup for 17-year-olds.
I am confident that there will be an echo of football on all sides.
Every generation will have an interest in football.
Everyone has to play this game so that there are no youngsters who don't play football in any school and college field of India.
Come, when all the countries of the world come to play on Indian soil, we will make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, Navaratri is going on.
It's time to worship Mother Durga.
The atmosphere is full of sacred taste.
There is a soul-modern atmosphere, a surrounding atmosphere and a philosophy
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen, wishes and aspirations of the common man of the country should be fulfilled and the country should take new heights.
The country has to get the opportunity to face every challenge.
The nation should move forward in a rapid pace, when India is 75 years old after independence in 2022, we should move ahead with the dreams of those who have been free of pride, the hard work of 125 crore countrymen, the unrestrained hard work, the inadequate energy and the mindset and let us move ahead with the five-year programmes for a New India, and give us our blessings.
My best wishes to you all.
Engage in festivals, spread the cavalry.
This land of ours was born by Lord Buddha and Gandhi and Sardar Patel for the unity of the nation.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have been honoured and honoured for the values and values of life that are commonly observed.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: - We have come to hear and say this word from our childhood.
This diversity is not seen only in food habits, shelters and dresses
This diversity is seen in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been set up in accordance with the nature text.
All these are directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and fishermen.
Today, while talking about the festivals with you, I would like to say that Michael is sad for all of you.
The Jains celebrated the Samvatsari festival yesterday.
The festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samvatsari is coming on the last day of the Brussels celebrations.
This is a wonderful tradition.
The day of Samvatsari was marked by forgiveness, arrogance and friendship.
This festival is a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
Best wishes to all the people of the country on their birth anniversary.
Now the festival is celebrated in Kerala.
In the colorful festivals of India, the festival of Hon'ble of Kerala is one of the major festivals.
Nowadays, our festivals have become a factor of attraction for tourism.
I would like to tell the countrymen that navaratri zeal in Gujarat, durka zeal in Bengal, these are tourist attractions in a way.
Our other festivals have also created an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think about what else we can do in this direction.
The festival is scheduled to be held in a few days.
At the same time, in New India, festivals should be a factor for cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are also associated with family life.
Preparation for the festival is focusing on cleanliness.
This is not a new thing for all of us but it is essential to change it as a social organism.
They blossom their colors, and one blossoms the colour, and one puts a piece of paper in it.
Every family is doing a variety of benefits.
In a way, this great exercise of environmental awareness has been observed for the first time in this familiar spirit.
3 years ago, we have started the Swachh Bharat Mission and will complete 3 years from 2nd October.
The positive consequences are emerging.
The area of toilets has reached about 67 percent from 39 percent.
The people of Jamiat Ulema A. Hind have demonstrated a vision to inspire everyone to inspire unity in the cause of cleanliness.
If the efforts made with dedication and dedication towards cleanliness are transformed into a perpetual nature, then what can be achieved by our country
When will we get the opportunity, where will we get the opportunity
But we all have to join this thing.
Let us consider this as a preparation for Deepavali or a preparation for Navaratri or a preparation for Durga Puja.
Let's do a physical service.
And we will work together on holidays, and on Sundays.
We will go to the neighbouring neighbourhoods, to the nearby villages, but we can do this as a movement.
I appeal to all non-governmental organisations, schools, colleges, social-cultural leaders, government officials, district officials and panchayat leaders - 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, we will create an environment related to cleanliness, which is indeed a October 2 dreamt of by Gandhiji.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation MyGov.
After the construction of the toilet, you can register the names of those whom you have helped in setting up a toilet.
Friends from my community can intensify some constructive movements and ensuring work at the grassroots level.
Through commitment to hygiene, success in achieving cleanliness, the concept of competitiveness, short-production competition and painting is being organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.
You can write articles in many languages, there is no age.
You can produce a short film and produce it on your mobile phone.
It should be produced as a 2-3 minute short film and it should be an inspiration for cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this movement of cleanliness.
When we celebrate the 2nd of October after organising this 15-day Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, we see how clean we can enjoy the blessings of Gandhiji.
Millions of people are writing letters, reports, many are delivering messages through phones, and this is a big source of wealth for me.
This is a great opportunity to understand the minds of the countrymen.
I wait for you more than what you wait for the voice of mind.
I am thirsty because every thing of you gives me the opportunity to learn.
Yes, I too have made such a mistake.
Sometimes we cannot even tell us how many things can be transformed naturally, we are doing wrong.
Prime Minister, I am talking from Pune to Aparna.
I want to talk to you about my friend
She's always trying to help everyone, but one of her actions makes me frustrated.
Once I went to the business complex to buy goods with her.
She spent 2000 rupees without any difficulty in buying a shirt, then spent 450 rupees and bought a beat
But she was actively involved in a deal worth 5 rupees with the auto driver who used the premises.
When he bought vegetables on the way back, he chewed a deal at every vegetable price and saved 4-5 rupees.
It's very difficult for me.
We are buying goods without asking any questions at large places, we are fighting our brothers and sisters who have lived hard and are fighting for retail money.
After listening to this phone call, I am sure that you might have been shocked and you might be convinced in your mind that I will not be able to act like this.
Have you ever thought of what will run in the minds of the poor
My young friends, the entire country is going to celebrate 29th August as a day of all sports.
This is the birth anniversary of Hockey Sportsperson and Major Trincent ji, who is considered to be the world's beloved.
His contribution to Hockey has not been added.
I remember this thing because the young community of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports must become part of our lives.
As we are youngsters in the world, we must reflect our youth in the playgrounds.
What else do you want to say is physical strength, awakening mind and governance.
Sports in a way is a combination of mind.
I would like to assert that the younger generation of our country should proceed in the sports world, which is even more important than the sports field and calculating sports in the world today.
For example, the FIFA can play all the footballs, but I have seen a football in the ground.
You can calculate cricket, but play under the sky in the field, its joy is impossible.
Sometimes when all the kids in the house go out, she asked her when she was coming back.
If this has changed in today's era, children are sitting in a corner and start watching cortoon or drowning in mobile cameras.
If there is any achievement in the field of sports, if any child of the country is capable of providing information or video to them in this portal.
The Forum is scheduled to be inaugurated tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to train selected and growing sportspersons.
In India, from 6th to 28th October, the FIFA has been organised for a world footprint for 17-year-olds.
24 teams from all over the world are coming to India.
Let us welcome young social guests from many countries through sports festivals, let us enjoy sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, I would like to share with you about the event that took place in the past weeks.
Six such women are working in the navy.
Their feelings and their incentives are inspiring for all of us.
These 6 women's wealth are also travelling in a small boat INS TARINI and trying to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Parikrama i. e.
And they shall compass the whole world, and return to India after several months.
Sometimes they spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes we may have to spend about 30 days in water.
This is the first time in the world that our six women travel through the waves of the sea.
I am also organising an exclusive process for their experiences in the NarendraModi App and studying you
You must read it, because it will be my pleasure to share with you the experiences of a kind of brave story, self-experienced story and these women wealth.
My best wishes to these women and my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on the 5th of September.
The former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji.
Though he was the President, he made himself a writer throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a literature.
He was dedicated to the education site.
While being a lawyer, a diplomat, the President of India, he was a surviving authority every moment.
I remember him.
This time when we celebrate Teachers' Day, can we all take a pledge together
Because of its efforts, the events that have succeeded in transforming someone's lives will certainly be in the lives of every teacher.
If we make efforts on a social basis, we can make changes in the country, we can play a big role in this thing.
Come, let us learn to change, let us take this mantra forward.
Ananya Avasti.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre of Howard University.
As an analyst, I am very interested in financial inclusion and related social programmes.
I want to ask you the question that in 2014, when you started your Jan Dhan Yojana, in the last three years, whether India is financially safer, whether the power has increased, this power-sharing and facilities have reached our women, the farmers, the workers, the villages, the hunters and the statistics.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been asked about the financial inclusion - it has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also in the economic world.
On 28th August 2014, I had launched this scheme with a dream in my mind.
Yesterday, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be launched and 3 years will be completed.
30 crore new families have been connected to it and bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the number of countries in the world.
Sometimes, if the money is rotten in the hand, in the bag, in the house, it will instigate the cost of waste.
65,000 crore rupees have been saved by our poor through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
In a way, this saving of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, those who have opened their bank accounts will also get insurance benefits.
Today a new hope has been created in the lives of those poor people by paying a very simple fee of Rs.
If the poor gets a problem because of the cost of one rupee in many families, if the head of the family dies, the family gets Rs. 2 lakhs.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start Up Yojana and Stand Up Yojana, crores of youngsters have been able to get funds without any connection from the banks.
They are not only on their own feet but also on successful efforts to provide employment to one or two people.
In the past few days when some people from the banking sector had come to meet me, they had received a lot of incentives during a survey of how the common man had benefited from Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, RuPay cards and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will do my best to bring these things to your sight
Even in the media, there are events that can be fully utilized.
They can also interact with such individuals and create a new zeal for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again I salute you all.
English rendering of PMs address at Indian Radio in Agha
The rainy season is the time for the people to lose their hearts.
Animals, birds, plants and nature flows with the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when this rain was heavy, we know how much water has the power to destroy it.
Natural Mother gives us life, raises all of us, but in some cases, natural disasters like floods, earthquakes and their drastic forms cause great destruction.
The changing climate and environmental change are causing a negative impact.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, particularly in parts of Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal, there had to face natural calamities due to heavy rainfall.
Complete surveillance operations are underway in flood affected areas.
The State Governments are making great efforts to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens of the emotional sense of service are also making every effort to provide assistance to the people in this situation.
Farming, animal wealth, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are all affected.
Specifically, in order to meet the losses of our farmer brothers and their lands, we have launched schemes for the immediate completion of the claims of farmers, insurance companies, particularly crop insurance companies, to ensure their livelihood.
Further, a 24-hour support number of 1078 cases has been fully operational to combat floods.
People are expressing their problems in this regard.
Prior to the start of the monsoon, a training drive was carried out in the majority of the seats and the entire government machine was kept ready.
The National Disaster Rescue Forces were mounted.
They were trained to create, do and do what to do, decide, create a peoples organisation, and work in such situations.
Nowadays, the climate has been calculated and technology has grown a lot, and space science plays a big role in calculating it, which is why we have almost accurate estimates.
Gradually, according to the climate calculations, we have to change our activities and preventing disasters from adverse effects.
Whenever I prepare myself for the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can see that the people of our country will engage themselves in the preparations for it.
This time there have been a lot of letters and telephone calls on the goods and services tax.
Even now people have expressed their happiness and expectations about the goods and services.
I have heard this telephone call: Greetings, Prime Minister, I am Kurkown, from Gurugram to Kark.
When you spent a month, are you expecting the results
I want to know your thoughts about this, thank you.
It has been approximately a month since the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, the results have started to be known.
I see how this new reconstruction system has impacted the transport and services sector.
Materials are also fast moving.
Despite this facility, it has also strengthened the economic pace.
Because of the earlier separate taxation system, the majority of the resources of the transport and service department were spent on maintaining the documents and new installments had to be set up in every state.
This tax, which I say, is good and simple tax, has really had a very positive impact on our economic system in a very short time.
The speed at which there has been a change, the speed at which there has been a renewal, the new records have been established, all these have created a new hope throughout the country.
In many universities of the world, it will be a model study.
For such a massive transformation, with the involvement of crores of people, this successful implementation of this system in such a large country can be considered as a great success.
S. T.
All the states have a role and responsibility in implementing the LTTE.
All the decisions and the States have been taken together in a unified manner.
Your mobile phones are getting the price of a particular commodity before this reconstruction and how it was after the new construction.
This is a historic victory and a historic achievement.
This is also a social reform movement.
I would like to convey my best wishes to crores of countrymen and millions of crores of crores of people who have made such a big effort extremely successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August marks the revolution.
It is natural that we have heard about this thing since childhood and that the collaboration movement started on 1st August, 1920.
Then, on 9th August, 1942, the White Exit Movement was launched and we know it was the August Revolution
The country was freed on 15th August, 1947.
In a way, several events in the month of August are specially linked to the history of independence.
This year we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the White Exit Mission.
But he has made a call for this white exit.
Some people knew that Yusuf Meher Ali was right.
Our new generations must know what happened on 9th August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, we have to inspire all the historical pages of freedom struggle, binding ourselves and binding ourselves together.
What else can be a greater fervour than the sacrifices, sacrifices and dedication of our freedom fighters
The White Emergency Movement is a very important struggle for India's freedom movement.
This struggle made the whole country determined to liberate from the British rule.
During that period, it was against the British regime, that in every corner of Hindustan, the villages, the cities, the uneducated, the poor and the rich, all joined their shoulders and participated in the whitewash struggle against the British regime.
The anger of the people was at the height.
Hearing the challenges of Gandhians, hundreds of thousands of countrymen took the mantra of doing or dying in their minds and took forward the struggle.
Millions of youngsters of the country gave their lessons and books in the freedom struggle.
And the song of freedom was sounded, and they went forward.
Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan have played a leading role.
The Cooperation Movement of 1920, the White Exit Movement of 1942, both of which have two different dimensions of Gandhians.
The dimension of collaboration was different, in 1942, as much as the freedom struggle had increased, a mantra like Gandhians was to put forward the mantra of Doing or Death Death.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1857, has continued every moment in some part of the country till 1942.
This long-term period had created an independent hunt in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is no deterioration in tension.
People continued to come, embraced themselves, went away, new men came, they joined themselves, took the British regime and tried to enjoy the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had created a new situation, and in 1942 it was brought to the height.
In 1947, the British had to leave the country within 5 years.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom struggle had reached all the people.
These five years, from 1942 to 1947, were the expression of the people's satisfaction, and this was the reason for the country's independence.
These five years are their decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with these accounts.
We achieved independence in 1947.
Today we are in 2017.
About 70 years have passed.
Governments came.
Organisations grew, transformed, flourished and developed.
Everyone in their own ways tried to relieve the nation from its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment in the country, eradicate poverty and grow.
Efforts were made in their own ways.
We also got success.
We must celebrate 15th August of this year as the day of the 21st century, 75 years after the independence of the country in 2022, we must have achieved this success.
Remembering the Revolution Day of the 125 crore countrymen, on 15th August this year, everybody will do this as a solemn pledge, as an individual, as a citizen - I will do this in the form of a family, as a society, as a city and as a government department, I will do this as a government.
Thousands of people have to face the challenge.
Efforts should be made to fulfil the steps taken.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947, the five years from 2017 to 2022, we have to work together to determine the future of India.
We are celebrating 75 years after the independence of the country.
Every citizen, every social organisation, local organisation, schools, colleges, various organisations, all of us take a pledge to build a New India.
May this be our resolve to succeed in the next five years.
What goal should we go in as a country
What can be my contribution as an individual
Use technology, take forward all the tools, posts, plastics, articles and new ideas.
Let us convert this movement into a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will hold a White Exit uestion on Youth Community Friends at App.
This question is an attempt to connect the youth with the pride of the country and know about the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread this message well and spread it.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Minister of India, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort.
I'm an instrument.
I read them and I will try to reveal how much time I have on August 15.
An accusation was made before me that the speeches I delivered on August 15 had been a little longer.
I am trying to enforce my rules and I don't know if I can do it.
But I have the idea of trying this time to summarize my speech.
I can see if I have a success or not.
Friends, I want to talk to you about another thing.
India's economic system consists of a social economy.
We should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just occasions for happiness.
Our festivals, festivals and a movement for social rejuvenation.
However, every pandit of ours is directly linked to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
After a few days, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Jayanti, Pillayar Chaturthi, then Saud Chandra, then Anant Chaturthi, Durga Puja and Deepavali are coming together.
These connect individuals and society.
The natural journey between these two is continuing.
Ah Sey is an opportunity to move forward from the point of view of me.
As an economic situation, several families start producing rocks in the form of small slums even months before the Raksha Bandhan festival.
Several types of rocks are generated from cotton to wood.
But today people have started enjoying rocks produced at home.
This is directly linked to the poor artisans producing small lamps.
But today, while talking about the festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them, I want to clarify the environment.
Sometimes I see that the people of the country are more aware and constructive than me.
After the last one month, aware citizens have been writing letters to me about the environment.
You talk about the environment friendly child before the birth anniversary of Pilliar Chaturthi, then you have appealed to me that it can be planned from now on to increase the will of the child on the ground.
I convey my gratitude to the awakened citizens for the first time.
It is also our commitment that the children who are fit for environment-friendly, soil-produced children should be made smoothly.
This time I have said this thing very early.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for various festivals, festivals and festivals.
Over the past few days, our women and women have done a great job in the cricket World Cup.
This week they got the opportunity to meet everyone.
I was very happy to interact with them, but I was able to feel the burden that they were not able to win the World Cup.
The pressure on their faces was the shipping of the crisis.
I gave those women a different assessment on my side.
Look, today's time has become a media world, the expectations have gone a long way, if we say that we have not achieved success, then it becomes angry.
If the sportspersons of India fail, then we have seen the anger of the nation on those sportspersons in many sports.
Besides, these women have praised the achievements of their achievements and have made them proud.
In fact, the young people of our country, especially women, are engaged in several things in making the country proud.
Once again, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the younger generation, especially to our women.
We all have to take the country towards new heights, take it, take it.
Come on, let's travel together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with the hope that the future of the nation will be surely important.
Many good wishes.
The weather is changing.
After the rains, the cool winds have provided some sufficient loyalty to the heat in the past days.
Whatever the difficulties faced in life, however difficult it is, we can feel that in personal life, in public life, the arrival of rain and in the mindset of all of us there is a positive change in our minds.
Lord Jagannath is associated with the country's poor soul.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
In English there is a word called juggernaut, which means that no one can stop it.
When we look at Agaradhi, it was known that this word Jakarnot was made by Jagannath's philosophy.
In view of all these things, we can understand how the world has accepted this Mahathami in its own way.
On the occasion of Lord Jagannath Yatra, I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen and bow down to the Thiruvananthapuram of Lord Jagannath.
Come, let us all collectively get inspired from these holy festivals and share the pride of happiness and take the country forward on the path of development.
In this holy month of Ramallan, we have come to know about a very concept of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Islamic brothers and sisters living in this small village with their families, in a way there are brothers and sisters of a large number of Islamic families.
In the month of Ramallan, all the villagers decided to construct toilets together.
Therefore, they have said that they should spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this pilgrimage to the cause of social welfare.
We know that Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free in our country.
This week, Haryana has been declared open defecation free states.
I express my gratitude to the administration, rulers and the people of these five states.
We know that if we want to do something good in our own life and in our social life, then we must work harder.
If our signature is bad, if we think that it should be corrected then we have to take a lot of time to make efforts.
Only then will it become a physical and mental habit.
Similarly, some other bad habits are becoming our nature.
We have to draw everybody's attention.
We must recall the events that are inspiring.
I am glad that cleanliness has not stopped with the government today.
This has transformed people into a movement of society.
This happened in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
What is its goal
The construction of toilets in 10,000 households in 71 gram panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, the public and the government will be happy to know that they have been successful in constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
In, there are letters, letters and accommodation.
Prakash Tripathy ji remembered the urgency and said that on 25th June, he was the greatest in the history of democracy.
It is not just an organisation but a culture that is commendable with the awakening of the people of Prakash Tripathi.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of the democratic system.
No one can easily forget it on the 25th of June, 1975, a dark night.
No Indian can abandon this.
All the great leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned in prisons.
Today, the students of the media world and all those who work in a democratic system are trying to remind them of the time of the deteriorating period of awareness.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail during that period.
Atal ji wrote a poem in the country for one year after the announcement of emergency in the country and described the situation in the country during that period.
We have to make this tradition more stable.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian feels immense respect for his head.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world is Yoga.
Everyone from you to the mountain welcomed the sun rays early in the morning through Yoga.
Yoga was not the first time, but today everyone is associated with Yoga and Yoga is a bridge connecting the world.
Almost all the countries of the world changed the opportunity to provide this Yoga as theirs.
More than 4000 people from the United Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi were engaged in Yoga on the Chinese and the world heritage site of Machu Pichu, at a height of 2400 metres above sea level.
India's Afghan ally in Herath, Afghanistan, joined Yoga at Salma Dam and created a new dimension for friendship.
Even in smaller places like Singapore, 70 events were organised and they had organised this movement for a week.
This time again Yoga has made a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made Yoga and created a new world record.
I also got an opportunity for Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time it was a good opportunity for Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers were also engaged in yogic arts even in Siachen, which has a temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Our Army, Border Security Forces, Indian Tibetan Border Police Forces, Federal Police Forces and Central Industrial Security Forces, all have done their duties and practiced Yoga.
Since this is the 3rd International Yoga Day, I had appealed to the families of 3 generations to take Yoga and share it with me.
Some television channels also took this forward.
I had a lot of photographs and some of them were selected in the Narendra Modi App.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, I am Dr.
I'm talking about Annal Sonara.
Sir, I recall that you have recently mentioned in Kerala that instead of giving flowers at various places, you can give memorable books.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea throughout the country, sir
I liked it very much.
I am reminded of one thing that has escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we should no longer provide bouquets, give books or welcome handbooks.
We will also provide the doorsteps because it can inspire the doors.
When I was in Gujarat, it had become a habit, but after I came from there, this habit has become a habit.
But when I went to Kerala, I had an awareness again.
But when we deliver books, in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
Even if we welcome the charity cards, how many poor people are benefited
Expenditure reduces and works properly.
These things have a historical significance.
When I went to the UK last year, Elizabeth, the queen of the UK, had invited me to the feast.
When I was married, Gandhiji conveyed his best wishes to me and presented this handkerchief in a joyous voice.
For many years, Elizabeth Rani kept the hand pledged by Gandhians safe.
A little love of Gandhiji has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These habits are not turned in secret by night: but this speaking also leads to criticism.
At the same time, efforts should be made to engage in such conversations.
For this, whenever I go anywhere, if someone brings a flower, I will not deny it, I cannot do that.
We must repeat the criticisms, and gradually there will be a change.
My dear countrymen, there are several observations as the Prime Minister of the country.
Despite being immersed in the files, I am creating a habit, that is, by reading something in my letters, I have made an opportunity to connect with the common people.
There are several letters and many people write letters to me.
I feel it is important to share a letter that I have read a few days ago.
Therefore, as per the Mudra Yojana, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and getting some goods from the market.
In the meanwhile, my attention has been paid to the Government of India, Government of India, E-Marketplace, Government of India, e-Marketplace.
Whoever wants to offer anything to the government - whatever they want to sell electricity pulses, dust utensils, dust utensils, chairs, tables, etc, they can register themselves on this platform.
And it is compulsory that the government departments should go to this base and buy goods by considering who provides affordable goods at a lower price.
All the departments of the government are taking note of who is registering in E-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are available at cheap prices.
This is an opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship.
There is also an insignificantness, it has power and entrepreneurship.
I want all those people who want to sell their goods to the government, they all have to register themselves on this website in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, our achievements in space science have also kept our chests starved.
India's greatest speciality is that while our legs are on the earth connected with Yoga, we are fulfilling the dream of touching the far-flung applications.
In the past, India has shown a great achievement in sports and science.
Today, India is seeking its success not only on the earth but also on the application.
Two days ago, ISRO has successfully launched 30 Nano satellites with Cartosat-2 satellite.
Apart from India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the US.
This Nano satellite mission of India will be of great help in achieving information on agriculture and natural calamities.
Our scientific journey is an important milestone in our space journey.
Nowadays we can see that our youngsters are progressing in the field of sports.
Besides education, they are realizing their future in the field of sports.
Our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements are making the country proud.
Recently, India's badminton sportsperson, Kidambi Srikanth, has won the Indonesia Open Festival and made the country proud.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his teachings for this achievement.
T.
Sports play a big role in overall governance.
There is no famine in the country.
If the children in our family are engaged in sports, we should give them the opportunity.
And thou shalt not push them out of the ground, and put them in the chamber, and study.
Let him study, and make progress therein: but if he have more talent and interest in sports, let him encourage him all that are in school, college, and family, and in compassion.
Everyone has to dream of participating in the next Olympics.
Once again my dear countrymen, the period of rainy season and continuous celebrations has been a time to create new experiences in a way.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and I join you in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
This year's heat is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time we are expecting rain.
When I was talking to you today, Raman started in the holy month.
On this auspicious month of Ramallan, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of India and around the world, especially to the people of Islamic society.
In the month of Ramallan, significant significance has been given to prayers, spirituality and devotion.
It is a matter of pride for 125 crore people of our country that all religions of the world are present in India.
We must be blessed that our ancestors have established this great tradition to us.
There are those who believe in God, who deny God in this land, who worship idols, and those who oppose idol worship: so is our country full of many such gifts.
The art of living in harmony with diverse ideas, diverse religious practices and diverse traditions has become a part of us.
Be it religions, methods, philosophysics, traditions, all these are the only messages to us - peace, unity, harmony and harmony.
This sacred Ramallan will help us to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again convey my best wishes to everyone.
I am glad that a large number of people have registered their receptions.
Everyone wants to share with me individually about their experiences.
"I am talking to Diksha Kat.
As the habit of reading is almost free from me, I decided to study on holidays.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles had to be carried out for India's independence, how many struggled martyrs experienced prison atrocities.
I urge you all to send a message to the present generation about this thing that has been inspired by the greatest achievement in the young age.
I am glad that the younger society is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters, about the sacrifices of the supreme sacrifices for the country.
Innumerable people have lost their youth in prisons.
Many young people have kissed the sleeping rocks with their faces.
We can breathe the breathing air of a free India today because they have experienced all the hardships they have said.
All the great men who spent all the time in the freedom struggle, they wrote books, studied, performed all the great tasks, their writings also contributed greatly to India's independence.
Several years ago, I visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today is the birthday of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book Maji Janmade in prison.
He wrote poems on the prison walls.
They kept him in a small room.
Does the freedom fighters know all the evils they have committed
Only after I had read the book Maji Janmade written by Savarkar, I was inclined to see the Cellular Jail.
They are organizing a television show there, which is very encouraging.
Those who sacrificed their youth at the Andaman Nicobar Prison, called Kalabani, all the people of the states, all the language speakers of India and suffered a lot.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, the first Monday of the month.
Well, what if you're connected to nature
For me, we have to connect with us and we have to connect with us.
If we connect with nature, we will build a better planet.
Who can express this better than Gandhiji
Gandhiji once said: One must care about a world one will not see that we are interested in the world that we cannot see, that is, it is our duty to pay attention to the world that we cannot see.
You must have enjoyed the power of nature.
Perhaps you might have been very tired, and if you were to pour out water on your faces, then you might see what kind of fragrance you have achieved
When we are connected with the famine flowers, the new energy emerges.
Therefore, on the 5th of June, the worldwide movement of connectivity with nature must become a movement of connectivity with us.
The scriptures are based on the power of the Earth and the environment.
The Atharva Veda gives us the full guidance of the environment in a way, this is a thousand years old book.
Monthly Earth: Putro Ahm Prithviya is the case in our country.
It is said in the scriptures that the cleanliness that we have is due to the Earth.
Whether it is a festival in our country, a lot of devotional methods - illiterates, urban-ruralists, tribal communities, love for nature and nature is a natural lifestyle.
However, we need to understand this in contemporary terms and in contemporary terms.
There are several news reports to me from the states.
With the arrival of rains in almost all the states, a big drive of trees starts.
Crores of trees are being planted.
We also have to contribute more importantly and contribute to the plantation work during this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, the 21st of June is a day for the entire world to be well-known.
The world celebrates this as a World Yoga Day.
The 21st of June is spread all over the world as a World Yoga Day in a short span of time, which connects the people of the world.
On the one hand, while the separatist forces in the world are showing their worst faces, the world's largest warrior Yoga.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world with each other.
Just as Yoga connects the body, mind, intelligence and soul, Yoga can connect the world.
Today, because of the lifestyle, due to the increasing responsibilities due to emergency, life has become increasingly difficult due to pressure.
We have seen this situation in a childhood too.
Yoga will help us to live a life full of pressure during the period of passing through unanimous medicines.
Yoga guarantees both well-being and well-being.
Yoga is not just exercise.
If we want to enjoy such an inclusive journey through physical, mental, emotions and habits, then it is possible only through Yoga.
Two days ago, letters have been written to all the governments and leaders of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year I had announced some competitions and some awards related to Yoga.
Gradually, the work is progressing in this direction.
I have been advised to convey my best wishes to him on this basis.
This is a very interesting thing.
Tomorrow on the 3rd International Yoga Day, three generations of the family will be together to practice Yoga.
Three generations of mother-in-law, mother-in-law and son-in-law can perform yoga and give such a photo.
Yesterday, as tomorrow, it will be a commendable combination and a new dimension for Yoga.
Yesterday, it will be tomorrow's film, which will guarantee a bright future.
I appeal to all of you.
As the International Yoga Day is still three weeks old, start training from today itself.
You also share the things related to Yoga for your part, spread and join the people.
In a way, this is a pre-defense healthcare movement.
I invite you all to join this.
From that day onwards, I have been touring various parts of India.
I have noticed that some people have noticed what Modi has done.
An interesting phone call came to me, and I didn't think of it.
But I thank you for making me a different view.
I believe that this phone call will make you like this.
Vanakkam Modi ji, I am talking to Nina from Mumbai.
I have often seen Modiji on television and social websites that wherever you go, the people there are paying more attention to cleanliness.
Besides Mumbai and Surat, the people are listening to your call and taking the cleanliness as a movement.
On the one hand, there has been awareness of cleanliness among children.
I have often seen their elders betraying the streets.
After launching a cleanliness drive in the fields of Kashi, you have been inspired by it and it has become a mass movement.
"You are right, wherever I go, the government machinery performs cleanliness, but nowadays, cleanliness is being celebrated even at the community level.
5 days, 7 days and 10 days before my departure, a substantial amount of cleaning work is being done.
Just a few days ago, I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a massive cleanliness drive.
I didn't see this as well, but only after this phone call came to me, yes, I urge this thing to be right.
All other preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister are accomplished, but the importance of cleanliness is unprecedented.
It is enjoyable for everyone who wants cleanliness and is encouraging.
I convey my warm greetings to all those who strengthen the cause of cleanliness.
One has given me a suggestion.
It's funny as well.
The idea is good, but I have to think about it.
It is important that I will remove so many tons of dust pieces, rather than giving them a piece of goods.
The Government of India has decided to undertake a massive massive movement on waste management with the help of city representatives by the State Governments.
On the 5th of June, World Environment Day, around 4000 cities of the country will get the necessary material for collection of liquidity and liquidity.
Two types of dustbins are to be provided, one in green, the second in blue.
There are two types of waste materials - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
We have to follow the regulation, in 4000 cities, these dust dumps have to be placed in the blue hatch and put the liquid waste on the green dust.
In cooking waste, vegetables are unnecessarily needed, balanced diet, eggs, leaves of trees, etc. all should be put on green leafy vegetables.
If we remember the coloured greenery of the fields, what should be put in green dust utensils
The second type of waste is that of paper boxes, cardboard boxes, iron utensils, glass pieces, plastics, polythene, broken potatoes, rubber goods, metals, etc. , and all these should be put in the vault for dry dust.
A few days back, one thing came to the ears and Versova Beach, considered to be a dirty beach in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful beach today.
For this purpose, Afroz Shah has given him the United Nations Environment Plan - UNEP, a great award.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Earth.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days and months, there have been discussions and analysis in the newspapers, TV channels and social media about the three years of the present government.
Three years ago you gave me the responsibility of the Chief Servant.
A number of opinion polls have been conducted.
I see these as very healthy symptoms.
The last three years were addressed in every lecture.
People at all levels of society have studied this.
This is an excellent activity in the democratic system.
My clear and compassionate view that the governments have been obliged to respond to the people of the country must be dedicated to the task given to the people of the Mahasagar.
I express my gratitude to all those who spent their time, examining our work in a deep sense of humility, placing consultations, supporting and expressing grievances. I consider these things very important.
I also express my gratitude to those who have contributed significantly in their minds.
Whatever crimes are there, it is only when they are revealed that there is a possibility of recovery.
The process may be good, the lesser benefits may be scared, the worse, the lesser learning from them can be achieved through this.
A positive criticism strengthens the democratic system.
This delicate and research is one of the most important for the awakened country and a rational nation.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you, as an ordinary citizen, everything is bad for me, just as it affects any simple citizen.
Some people see the voice of Mann Ki Baat as a part of the speech, some people criticize it politically, but I don't even think that the program of Mann Ki Baat will change me as a member of every family of India.
It seems to me that in the midst of a family, sitting at home and talking about the things at home.
I am obliged to the President, the Vice President, the Speaker and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, all those in so many high offices have given importance to the Mann Ki Baat by spending their golden time.
In a way, the voice of Mann Ki Baat has given me a new dimension.
Some of our friends sometimes interacted with me while working on the book Mann Ki Baat.
I'm borrowed to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, the next time we meet, the rainy season will change in all parts of the country, the results of the examinations will be resumed and the results of the exams will start learning again.
Come, let us all come together in this environment, love nature and proceed.
My best wishes to you all.
Every time there are so many powerful interventions in the mindset, a lot of research is being done on the part of the government.
What kind of complaints is the experience of the people
We can generally see that it is the nature of human beings to give advice to others.
When we travel in trains and buses, if someone coughs, then it is natural for us to advise someone to do this.
Initially, when there were suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there were suggestions in them, it was a habit for many of us that it was a habit, but when we tried to approach it, indeed, I was very happy in the flood.
After I pointed out that in the Narendra Modi App, in the MyGov website, do you know what has been done with the innovative methods in order to prevent food from being wasted from all over the country
I have not even thought that the younger generations of our country have been engaged in this work for a long time.
We know that some social organisations have been doing it for many years, but the youth of my country have been engaged in this thing.
Many have sent me video.
Roti banks are being run in many places.
People are paying their bread in the bread bank, bringing vegetables, whoever needs them, they are getting these things.
Nobody wants to think of himself inferior to the supplier.
This is an example of how to collaborate in society.
Today is the last day of April.
The foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra comes in May.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the people of both the states.
Both the states have been striving to achieve new growth targets and have contributed to the progress of the nation.
In both the states, the great men have emerged and their lives have been inspired by us in every sphere of the society.
Remembering these great men, on the eve of the States, on the eve of 2022, when we will be 75 years of independence, we will take a pledge to raise our states, our nation, our society, our city and our family to the emergence of our states.
We have to move ahead with the cooperation of all the citizens.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of these two states.
There was a time when the change in the environment was spoken only at the level of academics and seminars, but today we are experiencing this in our everyday life, we are experiencing it and we are experiencing it.
Nature has changed the rules of its labour.
Our country has experienced the heat of May-June this time in the months of March-April.
When I was considering people's suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, a lot of suggestions were made about what we should do during the summer.
While all things are known and not new, it will be very useful to rethink them at the right time.
Prashant Kumar Mishra, D.
In Balkani, they have said that water should be placed on the upper floors.
I have seen small boys in the family doing this thing better.
If they think that they have to fill the water, they will leave ten times in a day to see if you are in the cup.
Besides these, the fowls behold, whether they come and drink, and behold the snare of the eye.
This may appear to us like a sport, but in reality, a wonderful experience of compassion is encouraging in the minds of those pinches.
In our country, birds and birds are naturally associated with nature, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts of the society at the same time.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru of the Dawoodi Bohra community, Saidna Saheb, had been 100 years old.
He lived for 103 years.
In order to celebrate his 100 years, Bohra community organized a massive movement to protect the Gurus through the Burhani Trust.
It has also got place in the books of Kinnas World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that even if we come to our house as a milkman, a vegetable seller, a postman, we forget to ask if you drink a mouth of this summer.
My young friends, I want to share some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that many of our younger generations want to live in a hut in a comfortable place.
Mother's fathers are very protectively maintaining them.
There's another bloodbath, but most people are in a luxury circle.
Now the exams have been completed and you have made plans to waste holidays.
The summer vacation will be a bit smooth after the heat is over.
I offer three suggestions to make you use your holidays well, three of them are special, but I would like to do something.
Get a new experience, try and achieve a new potential and decide to go to a place where no one has ever heard, no one has ever known, no one has ever known.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
Experiment should be positive, come out of your luggage circle.
We belong to middle class families and have a comfortable family.
In the evening, take your cupboard or bagboo or take other sports items and go to the adjoining areas of the poorest of the poor.
Play with the poor children there and you will feel that you will get the joy of playing in your lives so far.
Have you ever seen how big changes will be brought about in the lives of the poorest of the poor when they get the pleasure of playing with you
Once you go, you will feel like going there again.
This experience will teach you many things.
Several NGOs are engaged in service.
Seek you together with the Kukul guru and join you for 15 days and 20 days with some organisation.
Sometimes a summer camp will be organised, a governed development camp will be organised, a variety of constructive camps will be organised and connect with them.
After you have been selected in such camps, learn from the poor people that you have learnt as a service free of cost.
You can teach them how to do it.
Though technology is considered to be a reduction in distances and the destruction of borders, the evil consequences of these things are erosing my mind.
Six people are sitting in one room in one house but they cannot even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone has been deprived of technology.
Social nature is a good value, a power of social nature.
The other thing I have said is that you don't want to learn something new.
Sometimes there is a fear that our younger generation is becoming robots.
Friends, all the dreams that we see when we live in life are good things.
But we should keep an eye on the human elements inside us, and we should not be left out of our humanity.
Can we not focus on skill development
We are trying to spend time with us just a little away from technology.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, you can learn paintings, you cannot get a very good drawing, but it's Malayalam literature
The feelings inside you will start reflecting in it.
You will feel that all these capabilities and these activities will give you joy and that will not only remove the restrictions that you have built on one side.
Do something different, friends
This is your opportunity to build your blessings.
If you think that after all the examinations were over, after you came to a new position in your business, I had taught you all this then that opportunity would not be available to you.
That is why I want to tell you that if there is a Magic Learning Country, you should learn the Seattle Magic.
Please do this to your friends.
If there is something you don't know, try to learn it, it will definitely benefit you.
Awaken the positive energy that is within you, it will set up an excellent base for development.
Friends, we cannot imagine how many things we have to learn in the world.
There are many new places, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Don't think too much to travel.
Spend 3-4 days and then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, this time the Government of India has given you the immense opportunity.
New generations have made nearly cash transactions.
What are you involved in this scheme but you can earn through this scheme and do you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But someone else can recommend this.
You can connect others with this and if that new person does 3 transactions then you will get 10 rupees for this.
10 rupees will be added to the government in your account.
If you say you've saved 20 people in a day, you'll have 200 rupees in the evening.
Businessmen can earn through this and students can earn through this.
The project will be completed by 14th October.
You will make your contribution to the creation of Digital India.
You are the protectors of a New India.
I received a very interesting phone call.
"Congratulations Prime Minister, I speak from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh on Shiva Saubhai.
I want to talk about the red light.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic crisis, I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision taken by you people.
The decision taken by the government to abolish the red light is an organisational step.
But the root of this culture, which is rooted in mind, has to be rooted out.
If we all strive together with awareness then it can be overcome.
When I say that my aim is clear - Ever Burson Is Impartant, everyone is important.
If we acknowledge the importance of 125 crore countrymen, if we realize the significance of 125 crore countrymen then we will be able to realise the greatest dreams.
We all have to do this together.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of Lord Ramanujacharya, the 125 crore countrymen.
For some reason we were trapped on the threshold, we were very tiny, we used to think about the centuries.
The centenary of other countries in the world is also considered to be very important.
Just imagine.
Even today, how difficult it is to eradicate social conditions
How could it have been a thousand years ago
Some people knew that he had unleashed a massive struggle against the bitterness of society, the feeling that he was high and depressed, and the state of being unprotected.
He embraced and performed through his actions, whom the society considered unprotected.
Thousands of years ago, he organised a mission for the dedication of his house and successfully entered the temple.
Tomorrow, the Government of India will release a postal stamp to honour the memorial of the holy Ramanujacharya.
I salute the holy Raamnujacharya, and seek my devotional flowers.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow there is another significance on 1st May.
In many parts of the world this is being practiced as a day of labour.
While speaking of the day of workers, there is talk of labour and workers, and naturally I am reminded of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, we thank Baba Saheb for the concessions and honours being received by the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, while talking about Baba Saheb, while talking about the holy Ramanujacharya, Jagadguru Basaveswar, a great saint and social reformer of Karnataka who lived in the 12th century, has got the opportunity to remember them.
There was also a chance to release his piece of gold.
In the 12th century, he made deep comments on labour and labour.
In the language of Kannada, he has called Kaya Kave Kailas, which means that you can achieve the artificiality of Lord Shiva only through labour, that is, only the heaven can be achieved.
While talking about the labourers, it is natural to think of them by coconut.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we are celebrating Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world are celebrating this festival.
The ideas of Lord Buddha are very relevant when the world sees the violence, war, destruction and the conflict of arms.
The emergence of Ashoka's life in India and the adoption of Buddha is a great example.
This auspicious day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations.
This year's festival will take place in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious day, I have got the opportunity to dedicate my holy flowers to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
We consider our neighbouring countries to be composed and they should move forward.
There are many potential.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capacity and facilities of this artificial intelligence will provide considerable assistance to the economic and developmental activities in South Asia.
This is a good example of our endeavour towards South Asia.
In every nook and corner of the country, many families are united with the preparations for the selection of their children.
Today is 26th March.
It is a matter of great pride for us that Rabindranath Tagore and all his memories are wealthy wealth.
In 1919, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre was unleashed, and at that time Rabindranath Tagore was one of the great men who shouted against the massacre.
The killing had a profound impact on the minds of a Balagan, a twelve-year-old.
Three days before today, on March 23, the British took up Bhagat Singh and his comrades Sukdev and Rajguru.
On the 23rd of March, when this tragic incident took place, there was no fear of death in the faces of the martyrs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
They sacrificed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three are still visionary to all of us.
We cannot remove the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the whole kingdom of the British trembled at these three.
They were imprisoned, the execution was confirmed, but the concerns of the British regarding how to treat them were erosed.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I could feel a kind of shock on that soil.
I urge the youth of the country to visit Punjab whenever you get a chance, visit the place where the mothers of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagsingh and Badkeshwar Dutt are present.
It was a period of freedom and its intensity that was broad.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were encouraging the youth to carry out armed revolution.
Approximately 100 years ago, in April 1917, Gandhiji had performed the Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time, the expression of Gandhian thoughts and Gandhian methods in the freedom struggle of India was revealed in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the journey of freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of the methods of struggle.
It was the beginning of the era of a profound impact on the ideas and methods of Gandhians on the Champaran Satyagraha, Keda Satyagraha and the Mill Workers Strike in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, Gandhiji came back from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new impetus to the country.
Today, we cannot estimate the Champaran Satyagraha, keeping in mind the Gandhians in our minds.
Just imagine, a man who had returned to India in 1915 had just two years...
He highlighted the magnificent potential through the integration of Gandhians through the Champaran Satyagraha, the power to know the vitality of the Indian society, the power to inspire the poor and the uneducated people against the British, and to bring them to the battlefield.
We can learn from him how to start public life, how to work for it and how Gandhiji worked.
The great leaders of that period, Rajendra Babu and Acharya Krupalani, all of them used to go to Gandhi village.
He taught people how to connect their tasks with the freedom struggle.
Today, we are travelling in the 21st century, who wouldn't want to change India in today's era, who wouldn't want to participate in the transformation of India
These 125 crore countrymen, their efforts for transformation, will be a strong foundation for their creation of a New India.
New India is not a scheme of the government.
New India is a challenge of 125 crore people of the country.
This is the spirit of building a New India with 125 crore countrymen.
This is a desire, a desire, a satisfaction, a thirst that is deepening the minds of 125 crore countrymen.
They are doing this kind of work as peaceful and compassionate.
Many people go to hospital every day and help patients.
As soon as the news is needed, there are many people who go to Ododi and donate blood.
And if any man walk in hunger, there are many that understand good things that give them food.
Our country is a land full of many such priceless cattle.
Peoples service is called Magic service. This is all in our nerves.
If we look at this thing in a holistic way, if we look at it in a coordinated way, then it is well aware of how great power it is.
When we talk about a new India, it is natural to raise criticisms of this idea that it can be accepted in a democratic way.
But if 125 crore countrymen have fulfilled their commitment, if they decide their path then if they start stepping up one after another, then the dream of 125 crore countrymen that we will build a new India, then it will be conscious that when we keep looking at it then we will start melting.
There is no need to spend all the things in the budget, the government scheme and the government money.
That is, I want to say that every citizen of the country should perform his duties as a citizen and should realise his responsibilities.
Why shouldn't we take this journey of making our autonomy a good fortune with regulation and satisfaction
I invite you to participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
Over the past few months, a large number of people in our country have participated in the Digital Money Mission.
After the withdrawal of currency, there is a lot of improvement in the digital payment system.
Since we have started the BHIM App for 2-3 months, nearly 1.
My dear countrymen, we must move forward in the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore countrymen fulfil this year's commitment to digital transactions worth Rs. 12 lakh crore
In order to enforce this, we can digitally pay school rates, we can digitally leverage travel fees for a flight or aeroplane, we can purchase medicines digitally, if we run a cheap food shop then digital payments can be done.
Over the past days, several events have been organized for Digital Celebrations for the awareness of the people.
There was a commitment to do 100 events across the country.
80-85 events have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won their prizes.
Everyone was determined to carry forward this work.
One of the biggest challenges has also been arranged.
I am confident that we will create awareness about BHIM App, not just as long as Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary has been fascinated.
We have to contribute in reducing the use of cash.
My dear countrymen, every time I ask you to give your suggestions for the Mann Ki Baat programme, you are giving me a variety of advice.
But in your suggestions, I can see that you have always been putting more pressure on cleanliness.
This river is passing through the Risbana Bridge and it runs near my house.
Against the pollution of the river, we went to the area and tried to create awareness among the people on footprints, but there was no benefit from it.
I urge you all to send a team from your side, or to create awareness about this thing through the newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, how much pain is there in the minds of a student studying class 11.
I see this as a good sign.
Awareness has also started since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Everyone has made a positive connection to it.
This is a mass movement.
The hatred against uncleanness has continued to grow.
The significance of awareness, positive contribution and movement is certain.
Though the work is difficult, it has to be done.
I am proud that this feeling of the new generation of the country, of the children, of the students and of the youth is reflected in a good sign.
Today, in my heartfelt condolences, everybody is asking for the thoughts of Gayatri, I want to tell all of them - the news given by the injured must be a message to all of us.
My dear countrymen, since the beginning of the Mann Ki Baat programme, there have been many suggestions regarding waste of food to me.
We all know that when we eat in our homes and in public events, we eat more than necessary in our layers.
Have we ever imagined how much destruction is caused by the remaining remains that we leave
If we don't restore it, how many poor people will be able to feed it
However, the simplicity shown in this regard is a great treachery against society.
This is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if you don't waste food, the family will be economically benefited.
This is a good thing, it is a familiar thing, even if we think socially.
I want to be more aware of this matter.
I know some youngsters who have been running a mobile app
And if there were any food, they were informed, and they gathered the rest of the food, and shared it to the needy.
Our youngsters have been working for this in a way that will benefit the food in a better way.
You can meet such people anywhere in every state of India.
You see the ways to change.
They always say that those who are aware of the health of the body, put a little less in the leaf and fill a little in the stomach.
World Health Day on April 7th.
Universal Health Coverage has set a target of health care for all by 2030.
A study says that more than 35 crore people all over the world have been beaten by mental tension.
Friends, speak to the parents, brothers and sisters, to the teachers as well as to what is inside you.
Have you ever thought why they are acting like this
You must be well aware that they are in the first stage of stress.
Depression leads to mental and physical illness.
Just as diabetes provides a simple balance to all kinds of diseases, stress and our ability to fight against terrible conditions, our synergy and our ability to decide.
If you are unable to speak openly to those of you, then join the people with the spirit of service at some place near you.
Please serve yourself and participate in their comfortable sorrows. You can see your mourning yourself as yourself.
And if you try to understand the sorrow of others, and do it with the spirit of service, then you shall pour out a self-confidence among you.
You can easily dissolve the India that is in your mind by communicating with others and by providing selfless service to others.
Like this, Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You start your efforts from now on.
Make sure that millions of people participate socially in Yoga Day.
If you have any suggestions on the 3rd International Yoga Day, you must send your suggestions to me through mobile app.
You can create songs and works related to Yoga so that people can understand.
Today I want to talk to the mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about many things about health.
In the past, the government has taken a massive resolution.
The number of women going to work in our country is increasing day by day, their contribution is increasing, this is a welcome thing.
My dear countrymen, on April 5th, the holy month of Ram Navami and on April 9th, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be held on April 14th.
Let us also inspire the lives of these great men, let us satisfy ourselves for the cooking of a New India.
After spring, the crops will start becoming old and the farmers will get the benefit of labour.
In many corners of our country these new corners are celebrated in many ways.
My best wishes to you all on this New Year.
The snowy period is now hiding.
The spring is recording its presence in the lives of all of us.
After the autumn, new turtles have started blooming in the trees, flowers flow, forests, gardens and horses are pouring greenery.
Not only flowers, but also fruits are blossoming in the tears of the adorable.
Mangani's buffaloes have started to appear in spring.
Turmeric flowers of mustard seeds in the fields give hope to the farmers.
The flowers of the flowers of Puravasu are chartered on the occasion of the Holi festival.
Ameer Kusru has described these moments of climate change very tasty.
The fields grow hard everywhere, the male and female flowers bloom, the potatoes bloom, the potatoes cry out, the environment becomes smooth when the natural cave blooms, and the human is smooth in this environment.
The spring pamphlet, the Mahasivaratri and the Holi festival swings the flowers of happiness in the lives of man.
We are ready to welcome the New Year's Month in the context of love, brotherhood and humanity.
The spring is a combination of these two months.
Whenever I hear your suggestions before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I first express my gratitude to the millions of people of the country for sending and helping me with a lot of suggestions.
My best wishes to all of you who have contributed in the Prime Ministers App, in the Tower, in the Passbook and in all ways through letters.
Shoba Jalan ji in the Narendra Modi App said that a lot of people do not know about the achievements of the ISRO.
He further urges you to inform about 104 satellites and inter-imperial missiles.
Shobaji, thank you very much for recalling the description that has made India proud.
Our scientists have built India on the world stage.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in achieving many wonderful achievements over the past few years.
Now a few days ago, ISRO has made a new world record in the space sector after Mangalyaan was successful in sending Mangalyaan to Mars.
At the same time, 104 satellites of several countries have been successfully launched in India.
This is a great historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISRO's low-cost space programme is one of the world's wonders, and the whole world has praised the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is of utmost importance - Cartosat 2D - this is Indias satellite, which will help in identifying pictures, micro resources, infrastructure, development evaluation and planning of urban development.
In particular, our new artificial cartosat 2D will be a gift to my farmer brothers and sisters to know about all the issues related to how and how the number of baths in the country can be used and what should be taken care of.
As soon as we reached, our satellite has sent a few films.
It has begun to do its job.
It is a matter of great pleasure for us that all these activities have taken place under the leadership of our young social scientists and our women scientists.
This great contribution of young scientists and women scientists is a matter of great pride for ISRO's success.
On behalf of your countrymen, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all ISRO scientists.
Your aim of enforcing space science in mind for the people of the country is as much as today.
Whatever kind of appreciations our scientists and their entire team have contributed, they are less than that.
India has successfully tested a missile to interrupt the continent and snake missile in the defence sector.
This is a great achievement in the defence sector.
You will be happy to know that this technological capabilities in the world are only with the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though there is a missile to attack India from far and wide, it is capable of destroying it in our missile application.
When we see new technologies, we see a new scientific achievement, we feel joyful.
The man's mind has been trying hard to find out the laws of force in large numbers.
New science and new technologies are born from this.
Every technology has created a new era in every new scientific form.
My dear young friends, while talking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have repeatedly expressed my heartfelt condolences that our younger generation should inspire science.
Many scientists are required for the country.
Today's scientists are now becoming the factors of a stable change in the lives of generations emerging in the era.
No scientific exaggeration has emerged from heaven.
Gandhiji says that all scientific achievements have been achieved through experience.
Brothers and sisters, Baba Saheb has said that the truth is that we must appreciate the thirst, effort and sacrifice of our young scientists.
Science must necessitate the need of the public for how to facilitate the principles and the means to manage what kind of technologies it can contribute to the greater role of the common man.
Over the past days, NITI Aayog and the Foreign Department of India organised a very unique competition on the day of the 14th NRIs.
In Mumbai in 2005, there was heavy rains, floods, marine anger and difficulties.
If there is any natural calamity, it is the doors of the poorest of the poor.
Both of them decided to find a solution, they have saved the house in a full time, protected the households from floods and improved a house that can prevent water-related diseases.
I could see a lot of innovations.
I want to say that many people have made this kind of contribution in the country.
Our society is also becoming a society with the help of technology.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
Digital has been given a lot of importance over the past days.
Gradually people are turning from cash transactions and moving towards digital payments.
Digital payments are growing rapidly in India too.
In particular, young people are using digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
Over the past days, our country has received a lot of welcome from the Lakhi Grahak Yojana, the lucky consumer scheme, the Digital Business Yojana and the Digital Business Programme.
After nearly two months, 15000 people have received an amount of one thousand rupees per day.
Through these two projects, digital procurement in India is becoming a mass movement and the entire nation welcomes it.
Till date, 10 lakh people have been given the benefit of Digital Yojana, more than 50,000 merchants have been given an amount of more than Rs.
Under this scheme, more than 100 traders have received one lakh rupees.
More than 4000 businessmen have received an amount of Rs. 50,000.
Several people like farmers, businessmen, small entrepreneurs, industrialists, housewives and students are connecting themselves with this with great enthusiasm.
When I looked at this, it was known that not only the youth, but also the elderly, had a 15-year-old boy, and had 65-70-year-old senior citizens.
From Mysore, Santosh ji has expressed his happiness in the Narendra Modi App and said that he has received Rs. 1000 through the Lucky Grahak Yojana.
But I want to share with you what I think is important in his writings.
My dear brothers and sisters, your name and your action gives us happiness.
You are the one who gives a big boost.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his business after demonetisation and he has received an amount of Rs. 1 lakh in the government's lucky client scheme.
Today, even if he is driving a car, he has become the ambassador of this project in a way.
He shares information about digital money with all the passengers travelling in his car.
He is very enthusiasticly distributing things and encouraging others.
Pooja Nemade, a young friend from Maharashtra, is a student studying the backbone, who shares his experiences with his friends about how his family uses Rupee card and e-wallet.
You can lead this movement.
You take this forward, this has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
In my view, all those associated with this work are new fighters against corruption.
In a way you are the fighters of honesty.
The culmination of the greatest awards will take place on April 14th.
There are still 40-45 days left.
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
A few days back Babasaheb Ambedkar passed away on his 125th birth anniversary.
You must learn to deliver at least 125 BHIM App to honour his memory.
This time, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become Bhim App and Important
I would like to mention this thing that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb.
You have to ensure that the house goes home and connects everyone with it and reaches the BHIM App in the hands of 125 crore countrymen.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last 2-3 months, many cities and villages have been victorious in many cities.
Brothers and sisters, agriculture is the hub of the economic system of our country.
The economic strength of the villages is strengthening the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share a happy message with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the barns.
This year due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, there has been an unprecedented yield.
All the indexes show that our farmer brothers and sisters have defeated the old achievements.
On seeing the Mahasuel, every day has started to appear as if we are celebrating the festival of Pongal and Paisahi.
This year, more than 2,200 million tonnes of mahasul has been received.
This is 8 percent higher than the last achievement of our farmers.
This is a wonderful achievement as well.
I want to especially thank the farmers of the country.
There is another reason why I thank the farmers - apart from producing traditional food grains, they have cultivated a variety of pulses because it is very proteinous in pulses.
The voice of the poor has fallen in the ears of my farmers and they have cultivated a variety of pulses in about two hundred and fifty hectares of land.
This is not just production of pulses but it is a great service to the farmers of my country.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have made a record contribution in the field of pulses, by listening to a request from me.
My dear countrymen, everybody is travelling towards cleanliness through the medium of society, through organisations, through the medium of cleanliness in our country.
In a way, everyone has been aware of cleanliness in some way.
The government has been working on uninterrupted efforts.
Over the past days, under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, a programme for senior officers of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana.
The symposium was not held within the closed rooms of the state of Teluguna, but it was implemented at the grassroots level.
In February 17-18, the exercise of waste tools was started in Hyderabad.
Officials showed how they were cleaned and removed the toilets with two hatched toilets and brought them back to use.
They demonstrated that there is no difficulty, no psychological barrier, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles in the use of this new strategy.
We can clean toilets as well as toilets.
A family of 6 members will have an average Double Town Tower - it will be filled in about five years.
After this, we can easily remove the waste and return it to the second hatch.
How many things are highlighted in it, so many benefits will be there.
Even in the government, various sectors are organizing frequent Swachhta-related meetings once in two weeks.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development are going to strengthen the Swachh Bharat Mission.
In the second meeting of the month of March, the Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Rejuvenation of River Ganga have been in the process of carrying forward the Swachh Bharat Mission for the last two weeks of March.
Whatever citizens in our country do good work, the entire nation feels a new energy, it inspires itself.
In Rio Paralympics, we welcomed the audience of our talented sportspersons.
At the end of the T20 World Cup for the visually impaired this month, India defeated Pakistan and made the country proud for the second consecutive World Cup.
I once again congratulate all the soldiers of the Congress.
The achievements of our talented friends in the country give us pride.
I always remember that our brothers and sisters who have been empowered with diversity, those who have been empowered, those who have been empowered, those who have been empowered, those who have been empowered, those who have been empowered, those who have been empowered, and those who have been empowered.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is a matter of sports or space science, the women of our country are not ashamed of anyone.
They are bringing forward simplicity, they have been lit by their achievements for the good of the nation.
Over the past few days, our women have won silver medals in the Asian Rakbi Sevens Games.
My best wishes to all these heroes.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
Awareness should be increased in the family and society to give importance to women and children in India.
Today, this is not just a government scheme.
This is a social understanding and a movement of education for all.
In the past years, this scheme has linked the people's society, it has taken into consideration this important thing in every corner of the country and has transformed the mindset of the people about the old habits that have continued for decades.
There is a lot of fun in the ears when the festivals are being celebrated with the news of the birth of a girl.
In a way, positive thinking about women children is becoming a result of social set-up.
I have heard that due to a special movement in the district of Tamil Nadu, dairy farming has been stopped.
So far, more than 175 dairy vehicles have been blocked.
The district administration has started bank accounts in the name of more than 55-60 thousand girls under the scheme of Self Help Group (Suganya Samruti).
According to the Integration Model (Convergence Model) in the Bandhava district of Jammu Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the scheme to protect the girl child, to teach the girl child, to join the Gram Sabhas and to ensure that the district administration has adopted orphaned children and ensured their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a movement is going on for the education of the children of every household in the village.
The movement of our children, our school, our movement in Rajasthan is going on to re-school and re-school the girls who have halved their school education.
I have to say that a movement called Beti Bachao Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has been following various forms.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
It is accompanied by innovative ideas.
This has been changed according to regional requirements.
I consider this as a good sign.
When we celebrate the 8th of March as Women's Day, we must be inclined with a sense of unity. Our women and women of India, they do not have much strength, they all are equally comfortable.
You have come together with this positively.
I am getting a lot of things to learn from you.
All the feelings and feelings in the minds of the poor are coming to me.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Our forerunners have made the system of climate change, economic cycle and social life very well, so that there should never be a recession in society in any circumstances.
In the last few days we celebrated several festivals.
Even after tens of thousands of years, every festival is filling itself with a new spirit, with a new spirit...
Sometimes he lifted the mountains, sometimes he took up the task of eliminating the leaves of food, that is, we can feel an innovation in every aspect of his life.
Therefore, when I talk to you today, my child is going to milk two Mohans.
Mohn will bear the Sudarshan Chakra and others will bear Sarka.
Mohn, who surrounded the Sudarshan Chakra, drove off the river Yamunotri to the seashores of Gujarat, drove to the city of Dwargah, but Mohno, who appeared on the seashores, came to the shores of Yamunotri, and breathed his last in Delhi.
Mohn, who embraced the Sudarshan Chakra, used his intellectuality, his duties, his ability and his intentions in accordance with the circumstances of that period, thousands of years ago, to avoid war and live without conflict.
At the same time, Mohano, who had crossed the border, gave a new shape to the freedom struggle, to protect the country's independence, to protect human values, to empower the fundamental elements of governance, a new dimension to the entire world, which is still unique.
What is the significance of selfless service, what is the significance of wisdom, what is the significance of progressing with smoke among all the rising dimensions of life
Today, while we are talking about festivals, India is engaged in a big festival.
Not only India but the whole world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of our mother Gandhi.
On the 2nd of October 1869, at the Porbandar on the seashore, today we have born an era, not an individual, in a small house called Kirti Mandir.
This gave a new dimension to the entire human history and created a new achievement.
And there was always a thing connected with Gandhiji, in a way it became a permanent part of his life - service, service, service and service.
If we had seen all his life, he was engaged in the service of the people of the societies who were suffering from diarrhoea in South Africa.
He served for oppressed farmers in the Champaran region.
If someone needs help at any time, he will be able to serve at any time.
He did not only strengthen the service, but also strengthened the spiritual harmony associated with service.
But with this, the experience of self-sufficient joy and self-sufficiency is also within the services.
We can clearly understand this through the life of the mother.
For Gandhians, individuals, society, man and man are all.
Whether it is Africa's Finnics Farm or Tolstoy Farm, or Sabarmati Ashram or Varatta, he has always been firm on social mobilization at all places.
I consider myself a great opportunity to visit many important places related to brothers and sisters, and to have the blessings of paying my respects there.
When it comes to society, there is a strength for it and in this program of Gandhi 150 there should be social expression and service.
Whatever the mind feels must be a good will, a good intention, a harmonious one, a complete dedicational service and a spirit of joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had visited Tandi in Gujarat.
Tandi, who became the name of Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a great turning point.
I inaugurated the state-of-the-art museum, which was offered to the grain in Tandee.
I urge all of you to travel to some place related to Gandhiji and others.
In the coming days, many events, competitions and exhibitions have been planned.
But on this occasion, I would like to share a very interesting thing with you.
This time, in Venice Biennale, many interesting sights filled with Gandhian memories have been displayed at the Indian Gallery.
The part of Haripura is very interesting.
You may remember that during the Haripura Congress convention of Gujarat, the event chosen as the leader of Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in history.
A very beautiful past has been spent in these art areas.
Prior to the Congress's Haripura conference in 1937-38, the then Chief Minister of Santiniketan's Kala Bhawan called Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and exhibition at the conference.
The same Nandla Bose ji's hand is adding beauty to our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose surrounded the villages near Haripura and composed artistic paintings to illustrate the rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these priceless works.
Once again, I hope that every Indian should take a pledge with good wishes on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
What should be done for the country, for the society, for some good thing
This is the only thing that we can do for the grain, the actual activity will be auspicious and satisfactory.
Friends, for the past few years, you all remember that we have been organising a Swachhta Hi Sewa campaign for 2 weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
There is enthusiasm for all sections of society in front of this movement.
My business brothers and sisters, all of them have tied up a table in their shops, and have written in it that when the customers come from their homes, they should be brave.
This will contribute to the rest of the money and the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mother India, on this occasion, we will dedicate to her the India that was left out of the open defecation habit, while at the same time, the foundation stone for a new mass movement against fertilizers has to be laid across the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to every small area and to the citizens of the city, to bow down and bow down to the hand and to celebrate this year's Gandhi Jayanti in a way with the aim of freeing our mother India from far off places.
I appeal to the private corporations that you should come forward to get rid of these things sufficiently after so many of these things have been collected.
They can be recycled.
They can produce fuel.
But there was a lot before.
Today, I want to touch a matter of greater importance than a summary of gold.
Even though this is a matter written several centuries ago, even today, do you know how important it is
The monkeys are known as gems.
Food has been given a lot of importance in our culture.
In any way, we have made scientific even the knowledge of food.
We all need balanced and nutritious food, especially for women and infants, because they are the future foundations of our society.
POSHAN Abhiyan, i.e. under the Nutrition Mission, nutrition in modern ways across the country is becoming a mass movement.
People are fighting against nutrition cuts in new and open ways.
Once a thing was brought to my attention.
A massive movement called Digital Price was organised in Nasik.
In the sixteen days, Anganwadi sisters have collected a handful of grains from the people.
These cereals are useful for the hot food prepared for children and women.
This ritual is performed when the child is given first meal.
Not liquid food, healthy diet.
This is a unique effort and it can be implemented everywhere.
In many states, people are organising Didi Poshan.
The family members prepare a nutritious diet, prepare a tasty diet, go to schools, where all the family members eat and feed themselves.
They share their happiness, it will not be reduced when it is shared with happiness.
The feeling of joy with the spirit of service is a wonderful confluence.
Friends, We can intensify a strong war against malnutrition in our country through such small things.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both the poor and the vulnerable are suffering from this because of lack of nutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutritional movement across the country.
You must associate yourself with this, get information and add new ideas to it.
If you bring one or two people out of nutrition, then we can bring the country out of nutrition.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I had a lot of faith in asking questions about this matter.
And wherever I went for the past few weeks, whenever I met the people, Man Vs Wild was talked about.
I didn't even imagine that I would get such an opportunity to get a place in the minds of the youth of the world.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
Whenever I have the opportunity to visit anywhere as Prime Minister, however, the situation has become due to International Yoga Day, whenever I visit anybody in the world, a 5-6 minute has started questioning me about Yoga.
Till now, I have not had a discussion about Yoga as the world leader, this has been my experience all over the world.
But nowadays there is a new experience.
Whenever I meet someone, whenever I get the opportunity, they talk about forest creatures and engage in environmental discussions.
165 countries are in the process of broadcasting the Discovery programme in their language.
But one more interesting thing is that some people ask me a thing with a bit of embarrassment, Modiji, you speak in Hindi, when Bear Grylls don't know Hindi, how could you speak so fast
Has this been subsequently done
Look, there is no secret in this.
In fact, technology was fully utilized to interact with Bear Grylls.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing Jim Corbett National Park with me.
You too must visit places connected with natural and forest life.
I had told you earlier and I have repeated it and you must visit the north-eastern states in your life.
Your life is huge.
Your thoughts will be great.
I have had the privilege to release the census of the fireworks in the past months.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The number of LTTEs in India is 2967.
A few years ago, it was half of them.
The LTTE summit took place in 2010 at St. Petersburg, Russia.
The world's declining LTTE numbers were noted and finally confirmed.
The commitment is to double the number of LTTEs around the world by 2022.
But because of this New India, we are reaching the targets at a rapid pace, we have doubled the number of LTTEs in 2019 itself.
India has not only increased the number of tigers but also the number of protected areas and social security forces.
When I published data on the LTTE, I was reminded of the lions in the Keer forests of Gujarat.
I was there as Chief Minister when the lion's habitations were decreasing in Keer forests.
Their numbers continued to decline.
We have taken steps one after the other in Keer forests.
In 2007, we decided to place women guards in charge.
We have made improvements in the infrastructure to increase tourism.
When we talk about natural and forest creatures, we only talk about maintenance.
Therefore, it is necessary that we protect our forests, vegetation, forest creatures and protect them in a better way.
My dear countrymen, who can forget Vivekananda's historic speech on September 11, 1893
This young saint of India, who raised the entire world from sleep, has left a glimpse of India in the world.
The slave that the world saw, the same world changed the vision of India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji, whatever form of India he has seen, whatever power of Swami Vivekananda ji has seen in India, we will try to keep it alive.
It is within us, everything is there, we will move ahead with confidence.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating 29th August as National Sports Day.
This will be yours for children, elders, youth and women.
But today I am not going to say anything about their nuances.
I would like to create awareness about survival in your minds, for a stable India, for our country, we will together resolve certain goals.
I am confident that all of us will be able to get rid of the surplus goods, outside the house, and at all places, we will be able to shout about this in the social network.
Thanks a lot.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
On 26th January, we celebrated the nations shores with enthusiasm and happiness.
In a way, it is a cultural excitement that we are focusing on the political system of India, the obligations, powers and democratic system of the citizens, and is now aware of the democratic responsibilities of the generations.
But no matter how widespread and deeply argued the obligations and rights of the citizens of our country is yet to take place.
Tomorrow, on 30th January, our vegetarian food is missing.
On 30th January at 11 a.m. we all celebrate 2 minute and pay our homage to those martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the nation.
As a society, as a country and as a country, it is our indispensable nature to pay a 2 minute pilgrimage at 11 a.m. on January 30.
It is not only two minutes but it also has social character, satisfaction and the expression of our concern for the martyrs.
We have expressed our natural respect for the army and the security forces of our country.
I convey my best wishes to the brave soldiers and their relatives who have been honoured by various medals for the brave hearts of the President on this occasion.
In these medals, there are many studies like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Bharatam Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I especially urge the youngsters to do a job as you are active in the social infrastructure.
This time, all the soldiers who have been honoured, look for them on the website and write two good words, share them with your friends.
When we know deeply the messages of martyrdom, valour and valour of those soldiers, we shall have surprising, pride and zeal.
On the other hand, some of our soldiers engaged in the security of our country in Kutch have died due to snowfall.
I salute all the brave soldiers who have sacrificed their lives in this.
My young friends, you all know that I have been continuously shouting Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March and April, these four months are a challenging month for each family.
Even though a child has a choice at home, the entire family is dragged on the weight of examinations.
I have always felt that I should come out of this situation so today I would like to talk to my young friends in detail.
I want to ask you how to make such an environment happy.
However, I know that this question is in your minds.
The choices must be a happy occasion.
The exam period for most people takes place as a stressful period.
You should decide whether you consider it as a time of happiness or whether you feel pressure or not.
Whoever is considered to be stressful, they are sorry - pleasure for pressure.
Therefore, it is my view that you should take the exam period as a festival and a festival.
Whenever it comes to the festival and festival, the speciality that is present in us is evident.
The entire family must act as a group and encourage their contribution in winning this festival.
There will be a change when you are watching.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrupam, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there is only one choice in these 3-4 months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to make these three-four months of celebration in accordance with our family environment by serving their traditions in their own ways.
If you say that you were happy, you would feel loyalty, and even the old things of many years will be easily shattered in your memories.
You will be happy to know what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
The Sindhna Shakti will be strengthened and it will also be a burden.
I am experiencing and experiencing this. If there is a mind, then we forget things and if there is faith, then we cannot imagine how many things are very useful in our minds suddenly.
You don't have information or you don't work hard.
But whenever there is pressure, your knowledge and your knowledge will be dissolved and pressure will challenge you.
That's why I would say that a happy mind is the opening of more standards for a secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes I don't know that we don't approach the exams properly.
This is not the speech of your life.
How you lived your life, how you lived, how you lived, how you lived, how you lived, how you lived.
J.
Abdul Kalam is a great example of inspiring us all.
He went to the air force and failed.
Statistics have become more important.
This is the reason why there has been an increase in the pressure on the students' minds.
In this situation, I would like to find out your ideas about the current trend of education and its future.
If you believe in these things, you will be immersed in your backs like the window of the marks and the wind.
It is necessary to know what is the status of my knowledge till yesterday, where I have reached today.
If you talk about the world of sports, it will be instantly reflected in mind, then I have given this example.
Most of the successes are happening in their lives due to the sportspersons playing with themselves.
You will take the life of Sachin Tendulkar ji
He has been defeating many achievements for 20 years and has made a new record by selling the previous record that he has created every time.
His journey to life is very wonderful, because he has been following the path of making challenges to himself by competing with others.
Friends, in every sphere of life you will have to write an exam and if you have to study for 2 hours, can you study for 3 hours
You might have decided how many hours you had to wake up early in the morning and it might have been delayed, but can you wake up when you have decided
Therefore, I urge you to make yourself a challenge by competing with others.
Earlier, how was my activity, how should I move forward and how to do better
With this vision, if you approach, you will be able to understand the changes in you.
S.
Sundar ji, you're absolutely right.
Even today, you must have noticed that those who ask me questions, those who advise me, the number of women is higher in them.
It is known that when the mothers are aware of the future of the children in the homes, they are making many things easier.
You should act as a guide to the ability that you have and spend time with you as much as you have.
Once you are adopted, most of your problems will come to an end.
The expectations of parents and teachers are the subject of their problems.
Acceptance of the same is the way of solving the problems.
The expectations make the path even more difficult.
You'll be comfortable with weight.
In a way, we go to see the patient and fear the disease.
I would like to tell my parents that even in a few days we are making such fears with our children.
Have you ever thought of creating a happy atmosphere in the exams
You can see that the environment changes completely.
I got a very surprising phone call.
He does not want to mention his name.
If you ask why he doesn't want to mention his name then you will understand.
"Congratulations, Prime Minister, I don't want to mention my name because of a work done in my childhood.
Once there is a habit of insurgency, the thirst that learns in life will be lost.
Prime Minister, my name Monica, I want to ask you two questions about my exams because I have studied in class 12.
If students focus on sports, there will be a lack of attention to education.
This is the fault of the problem.
If you want to grow fully, there is a life that can cross the singers, which is very large.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Whether it is a five minute or not, you must take some rest.
You can feel that your work is not difficult.
I don't know if everyone has this, but this is my experience.
While addressing the dais during the elections, sometimes my voice will refuse to cooperate.
Once a native singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you sleep.
Till now, I have not thought that there is a connection between my sleep, my speech and my voice, but he gave me basic treatment.
If we understand the significance of these fundamentals then we will get many benefits.
Don't do that, otherwise your family will be angry with me.
On the day your mark comes, if you don't see, I'll be right in their eyes.
Please don't do that.
This is a great achievement to keep mind, intelligence and body healthy.
Well, young friends, I am talking about something while you are organising your exams, perhaps I believe that what I have said today will give you relief.
But I urge you not to be burdened even on what I have said.
If you do, don't do it.
Remember the resolution you have taken, trust you, go to the election and my best wishes to all of you.
Please change that challenge before facing every challenge.
Then there will be no challenge.
Take this mantra in mind and go ahead.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed.
On this occasion, I thank the Coast Guard Officers and the soldiers for their contribution to the nation.
It is a matter of great pride for us that our Coast Guard, with 126 ships and 62 aircraft, is 4 of the world's largest coastal guards.
The mantra of the Coast Guard is Vayam Raksham.
With this objective, the coastal guards are awake at night in terrible conditions in the task of protecting the coastal regions and seashores of the country.
Many people dont know that the coastal areas of our country are not only men but women are successfully performing their duties on the shoulders by standing on the shoulders.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are either pilots or supervisors and are driving Howrah.
As the Coast Guard is the world's largest issue today, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the Indian Coast Guard on their 40th anniversary.
The spring panchami of our country is a big festival for Saraswati Puja.
This is regarded as an opportunity to appreciate education.
Not only this, it is a time to inspire the soldiers.
Mr. Rang de Basanti Chola, I am sure that this is an inspiration for the spring.
I extend my warm greetings to my countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
My dear countrymen, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Aka Sawani has always given new colors to his creativity.
Immediately after the completion of my Mann Ki Baat in the last two months, they are broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in the state languages.
This has received a very welcome welcome.
I have got a great opportunity to travel with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Good luck.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all on Christmas Day.
Today, we need to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Several wealthy people came and provided wealth.
In the end, a poor widow came to her and gave her two cereals.
Today, on their birth anniversary, we will pay homage to them.
Just two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Varanasi, the land of Malavia.
I founded the foundation stone of the prestigious Mohen Malavia Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Centre will be set up not only in eastern Uttar Pradesh but also in the areas of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will not forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have taken pride in the field of nuclear energy.
As a party leader, as a parliamentarian, as a minister or prime minister, Atal ji's exclusive contribution has made him an example man.
Today, on the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I convey my warm greetings to him and salute him for his good health.
As a worker, I had a great deal to work with Atal.
His memories are green before my thoughts.
Today, Christmas Established, the benefits of two schemes are available for the countrymen.
In a way, both of these can be the beginning of new projects.
We can see that the whole country has the desire to know about how to do non-crore business, how to buy non-cropic goods from villages, cities, learners and ancestralists.
Everyone wants to learn the methods related to it from others.
Digidhan Business Programme, which has been aimed at encouraging businessmen, will receive 15000 prizes as Christmas Award on 25th December.
This scheme is going to be held for 100 days from today.
Every day 15,000 people will receive a prize of 1000 rupees.
Digi is a major business plan for businessmen.
The business of the businessmen will also have a unique opportunity to carry on their businesses.
The scheme is designed to focus on all sections of the society, particularly the poor and the lower middle class.
Whoever buys 50 rupees to 3000 rupees, it will benefit them.
This is not for those who buy more than Rs. 3000.
Even the poorest of the markets can use USSD, feature phones and simple phones to purchase goods, sell them, pay the money, all of them will benefit from this scheme.
People in rural areas can sell or sell goods through AEPS and win prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India, out of which 20 crore cards are poor families and Jan Dhan account holders.
30 crore people will be able to participate in this prize immediately.
I am sure that the countrymen will be able to take the country in this manner and they will be enthusiastic about getting the necessary information from the youth around them.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see that awareness is spreading rapidly about how to use technology in the country, how to pay e-mode and how to pay online.
Over the past few days, cashless business has grown from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to take this forward.
Businessmen are well aware of how big this resolution is.
Income tax benefits have been provided to such businessmen, who are making digital transactions, who are paying online payments instead of using cash in their business.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has formed a committee headed by him and he has been reviewing various schemes.
At the same time, the governments have also started several schemes in their own way.
I have been told that the State Government of Assam has announced that 10 tax deduction for Digital Payments will be provided to the State Government.
If the branches of rural banks, with their 75 percent accountants, make at least two digital transactions from January to March, an amount of Rs. 50,000 will be given from the government.
The committee has announced that Rs. 5 lakhs will be disbursed as the highest fiscal for Digital Payments from the Government to the villages that have achieved 100 Digital Payments by 31st March 2017.
Several organisations have been successful in carrying forward digital transactions to rural poor farmers.
The taste is that this year's 27 percent increase has been seen in sales compared to last year's GNFC fertilizer sales.
A total of 80 rupees and 50 rupees are available at a place worth 80 rupees and are deprived of the facilities of insurance and health.
But now money is being paid in a cashless manner.
Our country is a young majority country.
Technology is our handwriting art.
A country like India should be at the forefront of all countries in this field.
Our youth have made significant progress through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital films.
Our youngsters must incorporate and strengthen this sector with new ideas, innovative technologies and modern methods.
At the same time, the movement to get rid of black money and corruption should be linked with full force.
My dear countrymen, I would like to urge you every month before the voice of Mann Ki Baat to share your thoughts and suggestions.
Accordingly, tens of thousands of letters have come into consultation with MyGov and the narendramodipp, of which 80-90 percent suggestions are linked to corruption and black money elimination and currency repayment.
After seeing all these things, I feel that they can be classified in three ways in general.
Some people have written extensively about the difficulties and difficulties faced by the citizens due to this withdrawal.
Otherwise, they mentioned how the priests have adopted new ways to lay the foundation stones for destruction and unfair activity in many places, as the sacred work is going on in such a way that this work has been done for the welfare of the nation.
My countrymen, you have written so many letters to me and I am grateful to you people for this.
"This is a commendable way in which the money is brought under control.
Though it is true that our citizens are facing difficulties, we are all on the verge of fighting against corruption and our cooperation in this war gives us happiness.
We are fighting against corruption and black money, like the war of the armed forces.'
They have written Gurumani Keval that every corner of the country is echoing voice.
These are the factors that make themselves real change, the agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude not only to myself but also to those who have made a harsh response to some people who are trying to lead the people in a wrong direction.
Religious efforts have been made to fight the war against corruption and black money
Not only this, many rolled in the ground, used their work and recreation, to tear off the pillars of those who spread the furnace, and highlighted the truth.
When 125 crore people of my country are connected to me, can there be something that is impossible
If there are blessings of the people of Magazine, is it not for Isan's blessing
I express my gratitude to the countrymen, I extend my greetings to them and people are taking part in this glory against corruption and black money.
I had hoped that there would be a detailed discussion on the funds provided to political parties regarding this war against corruption and black money in Parliament.
If there were sittings in the House, there would have been discussions about this.
Whoever raises questions that political parties have been excluded in all respects, it is absolutely wrong to say.
Whoever cannot openly support corruption and black money, they are spending their full attention and time in search of government grievances.
There is also a question of why they have often changed the rules.
This government is a government that runs for the people of Mahesh.
The government is trying to listen to the public.
When they deal with new strategies, we also have to keep new ways to break their evil ideas.
In the ongoing war as Vitak Khan and Kodaikandan, a decision must be made for corruption and corruption, drastic practices and black money.
On the other hand, letters have been received from many about what kind of bad practices are being handled and what kind of new methods are being used.
I convey my heartfelt gratitude to my dear countrymen on this occasion.
In order to share such information, the government has created a separate e-mail address.
Apart from this, you can also send MYGov to the Internet address.
The government has created a massive grief against all kinds of evils like the evils you inspire.
When your cooperation is not over, it is very easy to understand the war.
The third class of the letter is also in great numbers.
Modi sir, don't worry, don't be surprised, do whatever serious efforts you want, but don't mind if you decide to travel and put your foot on the road, you have to resolve the decision and retreat.
My dear countrymen, I had said that even after listening to Mann Ki Baat last time, our peasants have made drastic efforts and have achieved the records that have been created last year.
This is a good symptom when seen from the point of view of agriculture.
Be it the worker of this country, the farmer, the youth, the hard work of all of them has been renewed to the country.
Just a few days ago, on the World Economic Forum, India has engraved its name in many fields.
It is the result of our continued efforts of our talented nations that India has progressed in the global ranking through different indexes.
India's standards have risen in the World Bank report on non-free trade.
India has crossed 32 places in the World Economic Organisation report on global competitiveness.
In 2016, we have moved 16 places ahead of the World Banks Infrastructure Services Index for 2016.
Several other reports indicate the same assessment and India is growing rapidly.
My dear countrymen, this time the anger of the countrymen was read on the parliamentary session.
There has been an outbreak of anger over the functioning of Parliament everywhere.
The President and the Vice President expressly expressed their dissatisfaction.
But even in such circumstances, the mind is happy when there are some good things.
The country's attention has not been reversed even in the middle of the parliament.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy and proud to say that the government's efforts have been made keeping in mind the objective of the development of the talented.
I express my gratitude to the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for fulfilling this thing. I express my gratitude to the millionaires of differently abled sections of the country.
This government is committed to the welfare of the persons with disabilities.
Individually, I also tried to enhance its pace by taking this objective forward.
My aim was to get their rights and honour for the disabled.
Our talented brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and beliefs by winning four medals in the Paralympics.
They have not only honoured the country through their successes, but have also embraced the people through their capabilities into a marvellous sea.
Our valueless wealth and priceless energy like our talented brothers and sisters and other citizens of the country.
After the enactment of this Act for the benefit of the persons with disabilities, the availability of employment to the disabilities has increased.
The reservation limit in government works has been increased by 4 percent.
The Act provides for excellent arrangements for education, facilities and complaints of the disabled persons.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been organised for the disabled persons and you can understand how the government is with the disabled persons from the time the equipment has been provided to 5,80,000 disabled brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs 352 crore.
A new legislation has been enacted to slash the spirit of the United Nations.
Previously, differently abled persons were categorized in 7 positions, but now by passing the law, we have made it 21, out of which 14 new positions have been added.
For the first time they have got justice and opportunity by connecting some of the disabled persons.
For example, we have linked Thalassemia, Parkinsons, those affected, and those who were born as dustbins.
The Indian cricket team has won 4 poojas in the Test against the UK.
Some of these youngsters are very much appreciated.
Our young Karan Nair slaughtered 3 percent.
KL Rahul took 199 runs.
Teest Captain Virat Kohli not only made a good interview, but also gave a good leadership.
Indian Cricket Corps off Spinner, Pondicherry Minister R.
Ashwin's name was announced by the International Cricket Team ICC 2016 as the Cricketer of the Year and the Best Test Cricketer.
My congratulations to all of them, my best wishes.
In the hockey sector, after 15 years, we have received very good news.
The junior hockey team won the World Cup.
This achievement is an auspicious symptom for the future of India's Hockey Agni.
Our women have also worked well last month.
If the women hockey team of India won the Asia Championship, India's women hockey team won bronze medals in the Asian Games for those 18 years ago.
Like every year, this time during Diwali, I once again celebrated Deepavali with soldiers and went to the border areas of China.
I have celebrated Deepavali in the peaks of the Himalayas along with the ITBP, the Indian Tibetan Border Forces and the soldiers.
I go every time, but the experience of this Deepawali is impossible.
People are not just sending information, they are connected with the mind
One of them drew poems, the other produced films, the other produced cortoons, and the other produced a video.
That is, every household is like soldiers.
When I saw the letters, I assumed that how much imagination is there in the minds of the people, how many feelings are there
A soldier from the army had written to me - Prime Minister, all of us, the soldiers of the army, every pandal like Deepavali, Holi will be on the borders.
Every moment we spend ourselves on the security of the country.
Yes, but in the days of the festival, there is a feeling of the house.
But if you want to tell the truth, this time there is no such feeling.
There is nothing to think that we are not at home on this festival.
Somehow we realized that we are celebrating Deepavali along with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, during this festival of Deepavali, should the spirit of bravery disappear within the security forces of our country with a few moments
As a society, as a country, I appeal to all of you that this feeling should be natural for us, that we should mobilize our emotions, be it any festival or festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a joy, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some way.
When the entire country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, the strength and strength of the army will increase by 125 crores.
Some time ago, all the leaders of the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to meet me.
They belong to the Panchayat Convention of Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages in the Kashmir Valley.
I had an opportunity to talk to them for a considerable time.
Some of them had come to talk about the development of their villages, some had come with demands, but it was natural that the atmosphere of the valley, the law and order situation, the future of the children, when the conversation began to lengthen.
The heart touches the heart of these leaders of the village, with immense love and open heart.
During the interaction, when there was talk of schools burnt in Kashmir, I was able to realise how much tragic it was for our countrymen.
And they thought that schools were not burnt, and that the future of the children was tempted.
After you returned to your towns, I requested you to pay attention to the future of these children.
I am glad that all these leaders from the Kashmir Valley have done a great deal to me.
They went to the villages and brought awareness to the distant.
A few days back, 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the board exams.
The participation of such a large number of students in board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir have been tending to achieve new heights of development through education for a prosperous future.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to those students for their inspiration and also to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the village leaders.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people for advice for Mann Ki Baat, all the suggestions came about one thing.
All of them asked me to speak in detail about 500, 1000 rupees notes.
In my speech to the people of the country on 8th November at 8:00 pm, I talked about the launch of a transformational disaster in the country.
When I had made this resolution before you, I had publicly said that this decision was not simple and difficult.
But it is equally important to implement the resolution as important.
I am sure that in our average life, a variety of innovations will have to face difficulties.
Even then, I had said that this decision would be very big, and it would be 50 days to come back from its impact and only then would we be able to move towards the nature.
For 70 years, the effort to get rid of all the diseases we have been using cannot be as easy as possible.
I can understand the difficulties faced by you very well.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, such a large country, so many numbers of notes, millions of notes, such resolutions - the entire world is observing, every economist is embarrassing and evaluating.
India has tremendous faith in 125 crore people of India and 125 crore countrymen are determined to achieve the goal of their hard work.
All sections of Central Government, State Governments and Regional Local Bodies across the country, one lakh 30000 bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, over 1. 5 lakh bank agents and overnight banking agencies participated in this work with dedication.
In the midst of various pressures, all of them had a very peaceful mind and thought that the work of this country was a root caused by a massive transformation.
As a result, it is clear that India will succeed in this work.
I have seen that all of you work in banks and post offices despite all these difficulties.
When it comes to humanity, they are travelling a little more.
One told me that an old man had an accident at the place of Kanchwa.
Suddenly money was needed.
I am glad to know that when this thing was taken to the attention of the banking worker there, he went to the old man's house and collected money and saw no hurdle in treatment.
Several such unaccounted events take place every day in the TV, in the media, in newspapers, in conversations.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades who labour and contribute in this great swab.
But the extent to which the evil is spread, even today the evil practices are a habit.
Even now, they are contemplating that this corruption money, this black money, the money that is not accountable, can be traced to some way and saved.
They have been trying to save their money by enjoying the poor, enjoying their words or enjoying their minds and paying money in their accounts.
I would like to tell you this day - if you change or do not change your mind, if you do not follow the law or not, you will take into account what you have to do.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
Don't do anything so that my dear poor people don't get involved in the problem due to their sins when they come to know about the names of the poor.
A very stringent legislation has been enacted regarding phenomic assets, which will come into force and face a lot of difficulties.
The government wants that there should not be any kind of problem for our countrymen.
I live in Tirali village of Tirali Taluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good lesson to black money holders and corrupt people through 500 and 1000 rupees notes.
If this step has not been taken, then every citizen of India will never have a good time.
This is why I would like to thank you all for this.
Some of the things are being encouraged by the media, by the people, by getting from the government sides.
And there is immense joy and pride when it comes to know what a marvellous talent is with the common man of my country.
Even if you have an old note, if you want to eat food, don't worry about money, don't go back to hunger alone, you have to leave the food and whenever you want to travel on this route, you must pay the money.
People are going there, they are eating, they are returning money after 2-4-6 days.
This is the power of my country, the spirit of service and sacrifice.
During the election, I was talking about tea and this idea spread all over the world.
Several countries of the world have started talking about tea.
But I was unaware that weddings would take place during this Tea Dialogue.
On November 17, a wedding took place in Surat with the Tea Dialogue.
In Gujarat's Surat, a woman gave only tea to those who came for her household weddings, did not attend any other festivals, did not make any festivals, because there was a shortage of money due to monetary disposal.
The marchers regarded this as a honour.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Taksha Parmar - these are encouraging their contribution to the massive fight against corruption and black money through their marriage.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Navparinirat Bharat and Taksha for making the wedding a great valour and for making it a new opportunity.
When such difficulties arise, people make the solutions very well.
Some people have been benefited immediately through this movement.
The nation has profits in the days to come, but the profits of some are quickly settled.
When I asked about the incident, I received some information from small towns.
However, due to this resolution of the 8th of this time, everyone came to Ooty to submit their old notes.
3,000-3500 crore has been collected in 47 cities during the period last year.
Where is 3000-3500 crore, 13,000 crore
Is it not natural for the poor people to have sewerage systems, water supply systems organisations organisations to be set up by the Anganwadi Centres
There are several such examples of direct benefits to the eyes.
Brothers and sisters, our villages, our farmers, these are the strong pillars of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, because of this new change in the economy, every citizen among the difficulties is making his own destruction.
But today I want to convey my best wishes to the farmers of my country.
Now I was inquiring about the data on the sowing of this season.
I have an account of wheat, pulses and oil crops till 20th November, as compared to the corresponding period last year.
In the midst of difficulties, farmers have found a way.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given importance.
Under the Mudra Yojana, efforts were made to provide loans to them.
Several crores of rupees were provided to the poor under the Mudra Yojana because crores of people are engaged in such small enterprises and lakhs of crores of rupees are providing speed to the business.
Today I want to tell my small business brothers and sisters that you should use this as an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You too, through your mobile phone, provide an app for the banks.
Your contribution to the creation of a society without a cash-payer can be very big, you can utilize the entire banking system through mobile phones to enhance your business, today we can do business in many ways without handling the notes.
Technical methods are safe and quick.
I only want you to give me your cooperation to succeed in this movement and I am confident that you will be able to lead this change and you will be able to give such leadership.
I am confident that you can do the business of the entire village with the help of this technology.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have been subjected to greater injustice.
And the wage of the paper is one, and the sum of your hands is another.
You have to get your wages in full and no one has to share.
You should not be tortured.
If the money comes in your bank accounts, you can also buy goods in the shops through a small mobile phone, through which you can pay the money. There is no need for any smart phone.
Therefore, my hardworking brothers and sisters, I specially urge you to contribute in this scheme because I have made such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the workers, for the deprived and the deprived sections of the society, for the benefit of the victims.
Today, I want to talk to the youth especially.
65 percent of India's population is under 35 years of age.
I know that you are contributing a lot in taking this forward in positive ways.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, and you are my true comrades.
We all have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India, this is a golden opportunity to take the country towards the economic sectors.
My young social friends, can you help me
You will be aware of what App means, online banking, i. e.
These things are very simple for you and you are using them too.
But today, the great task that the country wants to do is the society without our dream of monetary money.
It is true that it is impossible to have a society without a hundred percent cash transaction.
But why shouldn't we make India a less cash utilization society
Once you start using this low cash utilization society, the goal of a society without cash transactions will not be far away.
I am confident that you will not always disappoint me because we all have the desire to change the lives of the poor of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities have been made today to create a society without cash transactions, introduce digital bank services or introduce mobile banking services.
Each bank provides online access.
Wallace's direct content is e-purse.
Several types of cards are available.
According to Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards, which have been used at a very low rate, after the 8th standard, they have increased by more than 300 percent.
Like the prepaid card on mobile phones, banks also have a prepaid card to spend money.
The UPI is a unique platform to do business so that you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This task is so simple as you send information on Wattspaper.
Even today, he has found out how to send information in Wattspoken, how to forward it.
Not only this, technology is very simple to ensure that this work has a big smartphone.
Money exchange can also be done through ordinary amenities.
Whether it is salava worker, vegetable seller, milk seller, newspaper seller, tea seller or seller, it can be used without any difficulty.
I have put pressure on efforts to further facilitate this process.
All the banks are engaged and engaged in this.
Now we have abolished the additional fees for online business and have come to an end all these taxes related to cards, which you might have seen in the newspapers in the last 2-4 days.
My young friends, despite all this, this is unparalleled for the entire generation.
I know that all of you are actively involved in this great task.
I have been listening to all of you in the form of WhatsApp, poems, poems, tunes, cortoons, new imagination and hobby
I see what happens to me when I see the creativity of our younger generation in the midst of the challenges, as it is the speciality of this land of India that once even in the battlefield, when we meet such a great transformation today, I see that a fundamental creation has emerged within you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I want your help and I believe that crores of youth of this country will do this work.
From today onwards, you will be a part of a society without cash transactions.
Give me all the technologies for online expenses in your mobile phone.
You have to lead a society without cash transactions, a mass movement emerging from the net of notes, a movement that liberates the country from corruption, a movement that liberates from black money and a movement that liberates people from problems.
Once you have taught how the benefits of RuPay card are available to the people, you will give the poor aspirations.
Within a month, we can build a new Hindustani and you can do this thing through your mobile phone
Go to 10 houses a day and join 10 houses a day.
I invite you, come, your support is not enough, we will transform this transformation into players, we will make changes.
We will move forward in this war that liberates the nation from black money and corruption.
This country has created a great revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again request you to take this movement forward.
I invite all of you to do this work in a socially, individual way, every school, college, university, national student force and nation welfare programme.
We will take this task forward.
We have an opportunity to serve the nation with greater heights and this opportunity should not be wasted by the golden opportunity.
My dear brothers and sisters, today is the birth anniversary of a great poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan ji and today on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Amitabh Bachchan has conveyed a quote for the cleanliness drive.
You might have noticed that the artist Amitabh ji, who is very much interested in this century, has taken forward the cleanliness drive.
Harivansh Rai ji identified himself through this tax.
I extend my homage to Harivansh Rai.
I express my gratitude to Amitabh ji, to join the voice of Mann Ki Baat and to take forward the cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, now your thoughts, your feelings, your letters and myGov and the narendramodipp are constantly connecting me with you.
Now at 11 a.m. Mann Ki Baat (Manadin Voice) will be broadcast, but in the state languages, it will start immediately.
Thank you very much.
Deepavali is being celebrated everywhere in India with enthusiasm and fervor.
Our country is a country that is celebrating a festival in a corner of the country for 365 days.
But one thing we can clearly see in all this is that this entire journey of the festivals of India, their spread, their depth, their acceptance to the people, all these are linked to the mantra of one origin - that is to move towards individual society.
Festivals responsibilities regarding trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Nowadays we celebrate a holiday on Sunday, but you must have noticed that the previous generations, the working class, the fishermen, had observed a holiday in the days of Paurnamas and Amavas.
Scientific evidence has proved that what kind of change is there in the sea water during the days of Paurnami and Amavasya, what kind of impact is there on nature.
It also affects human mind.
That is, the tradition of celebrating holidays in our country is also connected with the world and science.
Today, we celebrate the festival of Deepavali, as I have said before, it is a enlightenment to educate and give wisdom to each of our pandits.
It gives us the news that this Deepawali pavilion should be taken from darkness to light.
This does not mean the darkness of light
The darkness of superstition, the darkness of education, the darkness of poverty, and the darkness of social evil.
If we are able to get rid of the darkness of the individual, the darkness of the individual, the darkness that the Deepawali ships into bitterness in the society, then this is the aim of spreading light on the island of Deepavali.
You can see that every family has a cleanliness drive during the Deepawali festival, whether it is the house of the richest or the poorest of the poor, during the Deepawali festival.
There is cleanliness in every corner of the house.
The poor will have soil, but Deepavali has come, he will also keep his soil clean.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepavali is sharing his film on Deepawali by Twitter.
The UK Prime Minister had organised a reception to connect all communities in front of Deepawali in London, in which he participated
It can also be said that there is no UK city that does not celebrate Deepavali with great celebrations.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared a film in Instagram with great pride across the world.
Well, what do you know about that film
The film is a 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament wearing Indian clothes and standing at the doorstep of Parliament.
All these have been done in front of Deepavali.
The thing I want to say is that Deepawali is a shining darkness and a great day to inspire all the people of the world from darkness to light.
The news of accidents, fire and premature deaths during the Deepawali days is anxious.
There is another problem - a more embarrassing embarrassment when doctors visit Deepavali with their families in large numbers on Deepavali.
In particular, I appeal to the parents and the inmates that when the children burn the sheep, the elders should be with them, keeping in mind that no misunderstanding should be done.
The festival of Deepavali is celebrated in our country for a long time.
This isn't a single day
It is a long time for Karthika Poornima to say that the govertham puja, bhai diuj and lap pamphlet can be done in such a way.
At the same time, we are celebrating the festival of Deepavali and are also engaged in preparations for the Sad Puja.
In the eastern regions of India, the Sat-Puja festival is a big festival.
In a way, this is a big festival, celebrated for four days, but there is a great significance for this - it gives a deep message to the society.
It is difficult to calculate what the Sun God has given us, and from him we are all, directly and indirectly.
This sacrifice, sacrifice and hard work of the soldiers and security forces have been emotionally disturbed in my mind.
I want to share one thing from the world of these feelings - we will dedicate this Deepawali to the security forces.
I called upon the countrymen to participate in a movement called Sandesh2Soldiers, i.e. news for the soldiers.
I would like to bow down to the immense love for the soldiers of the country, the pride of the army and the lack of pride for the security forces.
The media has also turned this Deepa Utsav into a day of thanks to the soldiers.
When we are in a mood of celebration, if we think about them then a new energy is created even in those memories.
A message also gives multiple strength and the country has shown this thing.
And some took up the images, and cast lots, and made cartoons.
I can imagine how much pride can be given to the soldiers of my country.
So many things have been identified in Sandesh2soldiers' hashtag.
I would like to read the poem sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chouhan.
Ashwini ji writes: "I am celebrating the festival, I am happy, smiling, I am celebrating the festival, I am happy, smiling, all these are because of you, today I say.
I convey my best wishes to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani has sent a telephone call to me when there are soldiers and soldiers in the old house.
Let us ask what the soldiers want to say.
"Congratulations Prime Minister, I speak to Shivani Mohan.
Their families and their wives, along with military officers and soldiers, sacrifice a lot.
In a way, even the entire military community has received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, the army is not only on the border but also on every stage of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh has become free from the habit of spending external toilets.
He belongs to Patna, a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
Our soldiers from the Indian Diplomatic Frontier Force went to their village for holidays.
He visited the village when he was finished and there was talk of constructing toilets in the village panchayat.
It was found that some families were unable to build toilets due to lack of money.
Immediately, he took his book and handed over a cheque of Rs. 57,000 to the Panchayati Head, if there are no toilets in any 57 houses, from my gratitude to every family, make 57 toilets and get rid of the habit of open toilets.
He has given 57 families his own 1000 rupees and has given them a new strength to the cleanliness drive.
That is why Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of toilets in the open.
I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing that happened in Kerala too.
Immediately, the shields of the National Students Force, patriotic workers and engineering students came together to decide to build toilets.
All the items like brick, cement, etc., which were required to build toilets, were brought to their shoulders all day by day.
They constructed toilets in the village through their labour, and these youngsters freed themselves from the habit of toilets in the open to a small village in a remote forest.
That is why Kerala is going to become an open defecation free state.
Gujarat has declared that more than 150 people in all municipalities and municipalities have been left out of the habit of open defecation.
10 districts have been declared free from this habit.
But generally these things are not taken into account.
The old scheme and the new scheme will be implemented and the next project will also be expected and this will continue.
Those households in which there is gas connection in our country, those households where there is electricity, they do not need kerosene.
But the middle class has got the opportunity to earn money in this regard, who is worried about the government, who is also given kerosene, who is providing gas and electricity.
Look at such a big change, the sale of black markets will be prevented, the environment will benefit, our foreign exchange will be saved and the people will also be able to avail the facilities.
Yes, there is no doubt that the middle class and the non-monetary will suffer.
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guide to all of us.
His claim on every subject determines the quality of the country where to go and how to travel.
It is time for us to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after the other to get rid of the difficulties.
Whatever our old beliefs, we have to free our society from the difference between men and women.
Now there are toilets for children in schools and toilets for children.
This is a good time for our daughters to achieve a distinct India.
Though vaccination is being imposed on the government side, lakhs of children are being evacuated from vaccination and are targeted for diseases.
Mission Indradhanush, a vaccination drive for children who have been released from vaccination, provides children with the power to get rid of dangerous diseases.
We are in the 21st century, but the condition of darkness in the village cannot be continued anymore, a massive movement to bring electricity to the village is progressing successfully.
Even after so many years of independence, how will she be healthy when the poor mother cooked food in wood and smoked 400 cigarettes in her body
5 crore families are being tried to get rid of smoke and we are moving on the path of success.
Small businessmen, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, dairy sellers and end-to-face traders are lending interest to the mercenaries.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Yojana are the successful movements that have been launched to get rid of interest lenders.
Direct payment of funds to the banks through Aadhaar, directly to the beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the beneficiaries in the lives of the common man.
We have to fulfil our breasts with the memories of the great men and do so.
But a telephone call from Punjab touched my heart. "Congratulations to Prime Minister, sir, I speak from Punjab.
Sir, on 31st October, Sardar Patel ji was born.
Sardar Patel has worked to unite the country throughout his life, he has succeeded in this goal and united everyone.
Indira Gandhiji was assassinated on the day when she didn't know what to say about the country's misery.
We are well aware of what happened in the country after that.
I would like to know your views on how to prevent such evil events.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not just a human being.
After Sanakan, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has done the task of integrating the country.
Sardar Patel made efforts for unity, because of his main objective of unity, despite his anger and anger, his path of integrity is no less than a target.
But on the birthday of the same Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars were killed after the assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi.
The unleashed atrocities on Sardars on the birthday of the man who spent his entire life for unity are paining us all on one side of history.
But in the midst of these difficulties, we must move forward by placing the mantra of unity.
The unity of diversity is the greatest strength of the country.
The strength of India and the speciality of India is unity in diversity, despite variety of languages, varieties of castes, dresses and diversities.
Every generation has a duty and every government has the responsibility to seek the opportunity of unity in every corner of our country and to promote unity.
We will also keep ourselves away from separatist thoughts and divisive characteristics.
Sardar Saheb has given us an integrated India and it is our responsibility to make it a great India.
The original mantra of unity is the strongest foundation of India.
Sardar ji's journey of life started in the farmers' struggle.
He is the son of a farmer.
Today we have heard the name of Amul.
Every meaning of AMUL is well-known in India and abroad.
But some people know that Sardar's vision was created by the cooperative union of milk producers.
The district of Keda was called Kera in those days, and in 1942 he strengthened this idea, as an example of how Sardar ji worked for the welfare of the farmers and the Amul Institute of Mizoram today.
I convey my homage to Sardar Saheb.
Wherever we remember Sardar Saheb on 31st October on the day of unity, we will be committed to unity.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Deepavali is celebrated with the brightness of Kartika Pauri.
Guru Nanak Dev ji's teachings are for the entire human society, it is not only for India but for the entire human society, it is still a guide.
This is the message of Guru Nanak Dev ji, that is, service, opportunity, Sarabhad da Bala, good for all.
Peace, unity and harmony are the fundamental mantras.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji was involved in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev ji, aimed at liberating the society from diversity, despair and evil practices.
May your dreams, your commitments and success in all ways.
In the past, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country by unleashing a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri region.
I extend my homage to all the brave and brave soldiers who have lost their lives.
This cowardly event has embraced the entire country.
The anger of the people of the country increases and the anger of the people increases
This loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and lost their husbands.
The entire country is experiencing this loss.
Therefore, my countrymen, I still tell you what I have said before you that the culprits will be punished and they will not be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our army.
They will break every miracle by their valour, and the 125 crore people of the country will express their courage to lead a peaceful and peaceful life.
We are very proud of our army.
Today, I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the enemy forces of the country very well.
When they start to understand the truth, they have begun to take away such destructive forces from them and travel on the path of peace.
Every mother's father wants to start working at a fast pace with schools and colleges.
Over the past few days, business has started well.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution to our problems, our path of progress and our path of development.
We must take new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that if we have a peaceful consultation and set a roadmap for every problem, then we can make a better way for the future generations of Kashmir.
Responsibilities of the security administration of the citizens of Kashmir.
The administration has to take certain measures to enforce law and order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to follow the capacities, forces, laws and regulations that we have in our hands are all used for law and order and ensure peaceful lives of the common people of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who think differently from our views put forward new ideas.
Young Sharshvardhan, who is studying class 11, has given me a different idea.
"After the extremist attack, I felt very worried about my mind, there was a stir in my mind to do something, but I didn't know the way to do it.
Harsh Vardhan, at such a young age, you have thought positively in this environment of emotion, this gives me happiness.
But Harsh Vardhan has a great value for the anger of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the spirit of the people of the country.
Yes, you presented a positive approach.
But you know that during the 1965 war Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had led the country.
Every citizen had a determination to do something in his mind.
At that time Lal Bahadur Sastri was trying to give these feelings of the country the best annually.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and encouraged how to work for the welfare of the common man of the country.
And every citizen shall understand one more attempt to expose patriotism in the midst of the bomb blasts, which Lal Bahadur Shastri put before them.
While Gandhiji was leading the freedom struggle, he successfully worked to give a boost to constructive work in the society when the freedom struggle was dreaming intensely.
We and our army will fulfil our obligations, those who are in charge of administration, our countrymen and every citizen of our country will contribute a positive contribution to this patriotic spirit.
My dear countrymen, our sportspersons who took part in the Para Olympic Games have made history a success of human incentive.
Our sportspersons have acted excellently on the Narendra Modi App and you must tell this in your heart.
Not only your two, but every citizen of the country has got a sense of connectivity with the sportspersons participating in the Para Olympics.
The Para Olympic Games and the achievements of our sportspersons across sports have completely transformed the humanitarian outlook and the vision of the talented.
I will not forget the words made by our victorious sister Deepa Malik Ji after winning the medal.
This time, 19 sportspersons, including three women of our country, participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, when the talented play, their talent and sports capabilities are greater than their talent.
Mariappan Thangavelu has won gold medals in their heights.
Mariappan has lost his right morning at just five.
Even poverty cannot restrict his mentality.
He is not a resident in a big city, but a central family or a wealthy family.
At the age of 21, he has made meditation through hardships, not neglecting physical hardships.
While they have raised our feelings, they have also changed the attitude of seeing the talented.
Can anyone imagine that the alternate talents can be removed from the customary Olympics
This time it happened.
Abdul Latin Pearl of Algeria, who was a gold medalist in the Olympic Games for the 1500 meter race, was present at the event.
I once again extend my warm greetings to our sportspersons and I am sure that in the coming days, India will now travel in the direction of creating a positive programme for the Para Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in the Gujarat Navy.
It blossomed me with a very sensitive moment.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Camp for Divyangjans, in which several world records were created.
I met a little girl without an eye-catched girl who was called Gauri Shardul - a little girl from the tall jungle area of Nang district.
And she showed me some parts of it, and the people were astonished, when I had told it before the congregation.
I consider this as a great achievement by the Government of India.
600 eligible beneficiaries have been delivered within an hour of process of hearing equipment.
This has been placed in the Kinnas World Records Book.
It is a matter of great pride for our countrymen that 3 world achievements have been achieved through differently abled persons in a day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on Gandhi Jayanti.
I remember that cleanliness should become our nature, should become the responsibility of every citizen and should be seen as a waste of evil.
Now, on 2nd October, I firmly assert that there is awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
Similarly, everybody has tried to take a step in the direction of cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore legs of the country have moved towards cleanliness.
If the direction of going is correct, then the benefits will be good.
Whether it is a common citizen, a ruler, a government office, a road, a bus or a railway station, a school or a college, a hospital or a hospital, from the children to the elderly, the poor, the peasants and the women of the village have played their role in cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a constructive job.
This progress is not enough, we still have to make progress.
This is very important
This is why while talking about rural India, 2 crore 48 lakh toilets have been constructed so far, that is, about 12 crore toilets have been constructed.
In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of toilets will be completed at a fast pace.
During my recent visit to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat, the officials had told me that the day of October 2 will end the habit of toilets in the open.
Come on, people, we will see the progress of a century.
In particular, my younger brothers are fully utilising technology and I would like to present a programme before them.
The Government of India has organised a telephone number 1969 to know how the Swachh Bharat Mission is in your city.
You can fully utilize this, especially the younger generations.
The Government of India has appealed to the corporate world to come forward and make your contribution better.
Young professionals who want to work for cleanliness support the professionalism.
We can utilize them as Swachh Bharat Partners and Swachh Bharat Fellows in districts.
If this Swachh Bharat Mission is connected with the governments then it cannot be improved, cleanliness is natural and it will not be fulfilled.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, along with the cleanliness drive, we have to move towards the direction of fertilizer from waste.
Fertilizers have been asked to buy fertilizer from the waste.
The farmers who want to engage in organic farming should get this fertilizer.
Whoever thinks of developing the wealth of their land, whoever is interested in the welfare of the land, whoever has a considerable impact on the land with chemical fertilizers, this fertilizer should be given to them even if the requirement of this fertilizer is small.
Amitabh Bachchan has been contributing to this task as a business ambassador.
All the Ministers, Chief Ministers, City Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country are collaborating in deeper consultations with regard to cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be the financial model
There are discussions on all such matters.
I am constantly watching the news of cleanliness coming up.
I read in a one-day newspaper that students of Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to create awareness about toilets.
The Government of India has prepared a table for one year in its Ministries.
Each department should focus on cleanliness for 15 days.
The three sectors of Water Supply and Health Department, Department of Panchayati Raj and Rural Development have been collaborating and implementing Swachhta-related projects on their own borders from 1st to 15th October.
In the last two weeks of October, three more Ministries, namely Agriculture Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs, will be implementing Swachh Bharat Mission on their respective government boundaries from October 16 to 31.
If you have any work associated with these sectors then I urge the citizens to join it.
You might have noticed that the Swachh Survekshan Mission is going on.
First of all, 73 cities have been surveyed on how cleanliness is, which was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, and now we have lagged behind in every city and we have hoped to progress the next time.
There is a competition for cleanliness.
We have to provide all the citizens as much contribution as possible to this movement.
On the 2nd of October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Swachh Bharat Mission has been going on for two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepavali, I have come here asking you to buy some of the letters.
Once again I appeal to every family to buy a letter, and it will burn the light on Diwali in the houses of the poor.
Can we not do anything related to cleanliness as a citizen on Sunday, this 2nd October
I urge you to associate yourself with cleanliness for 2 hours and 4 hours and share your photo with me in the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
The effort of all of us will give strength to this movement once again throughout the country.
Recalling Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Sastri, we will be satisfied that we will do something for the country.
The responses made by the countrymen to my request to remove gas subsidy in the past few days is one of the most incentives for the country's survival.
This is a movement to gather food and clothing to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all of our workers took off the streets and took the old sports items in the families and brought them to Anganwadi in the poorest of the poor.
Those political thoughts that have driven millions of workers like me, those political thoughts have been explained by Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya.
Today is the centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya ji, who gave the political philosophy and humanitarian philosophy of India, the thought of respecting India's culture.
Sarvajan Hittai, Sarvajan Sukoy, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas.
Even Gandhiji spoke of the interests of those in the market.
How to bring the benefits of development to the poor in the market
In a single word, Deendayal has put forward a total of economic programmes for every hand, for work, for every land.
The country should celebrate his birth centenary as a welfare year.
The focus of the society and the government should be on how to bring the benefits of development to the poor.
I respectfully recall Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, who was a visionary of all of us, who was an insufficient source of inspiration for our thoughts.
The common man of this country has given me such incentives.
What are the aspirations of the common man of this country
The record of Samanan, who is in my mind and mind, has emerged in the voice of the mind.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all my thoughts and to all my efforts to bring it into all languages.
They compiled letters after Mann Ki Baat, gave suggestions and shouted the doors of the government, highlighted the grievances of the government, prepared special events with such letters, took representatives from the government side and set a basis for solving problems.
Mann Ki Baat did not stop with a 15-20 minute conversation, which was a new opportunity for social change.
What else can be a matter of happiness
Therefore, I am grateful to all those who have contributed in this victory, and I offer my greetings to them.
My dear countrymen, next week the Navaratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadasamy are scheduled to be held, the arrangements for Deepavali will start and in a way a different environment will be created all over the country.
The unity of society is the power of the country.
Let us think of making this Shakti philosophy a means of social unity, be it Navaratri or Durga Puja.
We will pursue the sacred days of Navratri and Durga Puja in mind the ideas of peace, unity and harmony to take the country to new heights.
We will celebrate Vijayadasamy with success.
This day is being celebrated throughout the country on National Sports Day.
During the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936, he has served as an important task for Indias gold medal.
At that time there were only 10 minutes to make a decision.
And it came to pass, that, behold, Trian Chand put three bucks in those ten minutes, and I put the bucklers in response to the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a sound of Mann Ki Baat, there are many suggestions in mygov website or narendramodipp.
They are varied.
This time, however, I had the maximum demands for comment on the Rio Olympics.
It makes me very positive when I look at the public interest in the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to talk about it.
Even beyond cricket, India has so much interest in other sports, so many awareness and so many information.
Sachin has written: "You must speak about this time in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Shakshi and Deepa Karmar.
One of these women belongs to North India, one from Southern India, one from East India and the other from the other end of India.
It appears that the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of making the country proud.
At MyGov website, Shikar Tagore ji wrote that we could have worked even better in the Olympics.
He added, Congratulations to you for the 2 medals we have received in Rio, Excellency Modi sir.
There is a need to undertake long-standing tours in sports.
Our parents are focusing on studies today.
Even now, in society, sports are seen with the view of time.
We have to change this idea.
The society needs to be encouraged.
Who can do this better than you
Similarly, Mr. Sathyaprakash Mehra has also written in the narendramodipp - insisting on the need for extra-curricular activities in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In a way, the same feeling reflected in thousands of books.
It is true that there is no alternative to the fact that we are unable to act according to our opposition.
We have got two medals in medals.
But if you don't get medals, you can see that for the first time in many cases, the sportspersons of India have shown considerable talent.
Our Abhinav Pindra ji was ranked 4th in the shooting unit and he lost his medal in a very small way.
Likewise, Sania Mirsa-Rohan Bhopanna took place in the tennis competition.
We have done well in the Athletics section this time.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalitha Babar has been eligible for the final contest.
For the first time in the last 36 years, adults have succeeded in getting the knock out of the hockey competition.
In boxing, Vikas Krushan Yadav came to the final stages, but he could not get the bronze medal.
Several soldiers, for example, Ashoka, Tatu Point and Andaman Das were special.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do more.
But if we continue to work as we have worked so far, perhaps we can come back to disappointment.
I report a report on the formation of a committee.
The Government of India will deeply appreciate what kind of activities are there in the world.
Action plan will be formulated on what sector we can do well.
We have to set up our projects with a vision of 2020, 2025, 2028.
I appeal to all the enthusiastic Indian citizens to send their suggestions to me in the narendramodipp.
Let the State Governments discuss and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of September, Teacher's Day.
I was able to learn a lot with these small boys.
For me, the 5th of September is not just the Teachers' Day, but also the Education Day.
But this time I had to go to the G20 summit and today I had to express my feelings in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The importance of the mother in life is the place of the teacher.
We have seen teachers who are more interested than us.
They have dedicated their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Today I see Gopichand as an excellent teacher crossing him as a sportsman.
On Teacher's Day, I salute Bullela Gopisand for her and her entire involvement in the sports event, and for her joy in the victory of the beneficiaries.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in the lives of all of us.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
The birth day of Sarvepalli, the birthplace of Radhakrishna
Whatever he has achieved in his life, he has always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he will never die as a student of good teachers.
References and citations of the books he had read in that month would have been found.
He would have been examining what I've done throughout the month in his sight.
Something is still like teaching me in his classroom.
Even today, he has been giving me a far-reaching education in a way.
When I see his signature at the age of 90, I am surprised to see how he can write such a fool in this old age
Because my signature is so bad that if someone writes beautifully then there is great respect in my mind.
Your experience may be like my experience.
Whatever beneficial you have in your life by your teachers, you will tell it to the world, there will be a honour and a change in the viewpoint of teachers.
It is our responsibility to increase the honour of teachers in society.
If you have taken a photo with your teachers, if there is any incident with your teacher then you must definitely share in the narendramodipp if you have a vision related to your teacher.
It is a matter of valuable value as the students see the contribution of the country's teachers.
But when we talk about Venkatara Chaturthi, it is natural for us to return our memories about Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
The tradition of celebrating the heroic square is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak.
He has transformed the religious process through a programme of awakening the nation and has transformed it into a social cultural day.
Hero Chaturthi was also discussing all the questions that touch social life, thereby creating a new upheaval in society and a new flowering event.
Besides, there is a mantra given by him - Swarajya is our birthright as the centre and the power of freedom struggle should be obtained.
Not only in Maharashtra but also today Venkatesh Chaturthi is not being celebrated socially throughout the country.
Discussing about public matters, conducting column columns and competing in the fortification.
The scenes would have artistically highlighted the things that touch society.
In a way, a movement that can create awareness for all is being done through socially motivated heroic square.
The Lokmanya Tilak kingdom has given us the mantra of our birth.
But we are now in independent India.
Come on, I'll call you.
Celebrations are the forces of society.
They provide a new life to individuals and society.
Life without festivals is not possible, but it needs to be changed according to the need of the hour.
I can see that many people have written about Venkatesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja this time.
They are concerned about the environment.
Friends, Mr. Shankar Narayana Prashant has cynically appealed to Moti ji that you should not use the idols of the plaster of Paris.
The idols made by the Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment, but many others have expressed their concerns.
I appeal to all of you to use the idols and statues made of kerosene and restore our ancient heritage.
Ganesh is the one who removes embarrassment.
In such a situation, we should not create a idol of embarrassment.
I don't know how you will take what I say, but I don't just say that, many people say.
A sculptor of Pune, Shri Ajith Thodbale, Nisark Mitra, Vigyan Prabodini, Nisark Katta of Vidarbai, Gyan Prabodini of Pune, Kirkawasa RAA Raja of Mumbai.
Several such organizations and individuals take more difficulty to build idols of dust and propagate about them.
It is also a social service service that is a heroic square that does not pollute the environment.
The Durga Puja has a little more time.
And for the pillars of traditional idols, there shall be employment through the images of such dust.
We will take a resolution that the environment will be preserved because our ponds will be made by the soil of rivers.
It is natural for all the people of the country to be proud when Mother Theresa, who served for the poor of India, is now being given the title of Puranic.
We have been blessed to learn something every moment from the saints, sages, saints, saints and great men.
We have received something from them, we are learning more and we understand good things.
My dear countrymen, when progress is a movement then how big will it change
People are seen as the form of Shakti Magasan Shakti.
The Government of India has been working with the people in the last few days in collaboration with the five State Governments to create a clean Ganga, clean the Ganga.
We called on the leaders of the villages on the banks of river Ganga to meet in Allahabad on 20th of this month.
And there were men and women among them.
I would like to convey my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have completed this great task.
I also extend my sincere thanks to the Chief Ministers of the 5 State Governments who have helped in connecting the people with the power of the Ganga with a crucial step.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my mind and I have a great respect for those who create such an opportunity.
On July 15th, more than 1.
More than 25 lakh students wrote letters to their parents socially.
Some people in English, some in Hindi and some in Chattisgarh had written to their parents that they should have toilets in their homes.
They had asked for setting up a toilet, but some children didn't celebrate my birthday this year, but certainly they had written that they should build a toilet.
Children from 7 to 17 years of age did this work.
There is a 16-year-old Mallamma in the Koppal district of Karnataka, who has performed a Satyagraha against her family.
And all these things he has not done to himself, nor to dress up, nor to eat up sweets.
The grip of the girl child Mallamma is that we need a toilet in our house.
Look at the significance of village leader Mohammad Shahi, he arranged for 18,000 rupees and built the toilet within a week.
But everyone has been involved in this in some way, and everyone is doing well to play a golden role.
I also call upon the TV channels to make such short films and organize competitions.
There is no need for a big studio to produce a film or a big camera
In today's era, you can make a film using your mobile phone camera.
The Hon'ble President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, inaugurated a new Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Several people can hear the question of launching a radio station by the President of the country.
Bangladesh is our neighbor.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal have a shared cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladeshi Pathar Radio are beyond the boundaries. People from both sides will be happy to seek adventure.
It is the greatest contribution of Akashwani to connect people with the people.
The President has initiated this.
I also express my gratitude to the Bangladeshi people associated with us for fulfilling this task.
I congratulate the friends of ASEAN for their contribution in foreign policy too.
My dear countrymen, all of you may have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I too am a man like you.
That's why sometimes some emotional events touch my mind.
Such emotional events provide a new energy and a new zeal that gives the people the inspiration to achieve something.
A letter that came to me just a few days ago touched my heart.
This is a mother of about 84 years old
If the retired teacher had not asked him not to mention his name, I would certainly have mentioned his name.
I also forgot the subsidies as you asked me to extract the gas subsidy.
For me, the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is equal to the Padma Shri award.
And it shall be known to you, my countrymen, to whomsoever they have driven out a letter from my side, and to whomsoever I have made an endeavour, that one of my representatives shall go and give it to the dwellers.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have been hurt due to drought last year but this August has caused a series of floods.
In some parts of the country, there was a flood again.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the Local Bodies, the Social Welfare Organisations and the Citizens have made efforts in a smooth manner.
But some acts of misery among the floods can be remembered.
It will remind us of this year's August that what is the power to live together, what will be the consequences when all travel together with the shoulders.
In August 2016, political parties echoing in August and 90 parties from all over the country, as well as all political parties in the Parliament, passed the law on the Goods Services Tax.
Appreciations for this have been fulfilled by all political parties.
This is a wonderful example of the consequences of all political parties travelling in one direction.
Likewise, in connection with the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties in the country had discussed the Kashmir issue in one voice.
The message to the world, the message to the separatist forces, and their understanding to the people of Kashmir.
After talking to all the political parties about Kashmir, one thing was well revealed that if I asked to suppress it in two words, they were unity and love.
These two words blossomed into the original mantra.
Whatever the deaths in Kashmir, whether it be the life of a young man or the life of a security force, the loss is ours, ours is ours, our country is ours, our belief, the confidence of the 125 crore countrymen, the hopes of the people of the country from the head of the village to the Prime Minister of the country.
Those who prioritize small brasses to create unrest in Kashmir, one day they have to respond to the illegitimate poor.
I have faith in 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi and I hope that in the days to come, the inspiration for sports will increase the enthusiasm and fury of every young man.
We all know that the world's largest Kumbh Mela is going to be held in a few days.
The word 'Rio' is going on in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Government of India had made a unique arrangement for Run for Rio to play, live, play and grow.
Now, in the days to come, in whatever area we are, we will do something to encourage our sportsmen.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to make your best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all do whatever we can honour every sportsman in the days to come.
Today, while talking about the Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student from Central University of Punjab.
Like him, many more poets may have written poems in this regard, some may have made them composite songs, this may have happened in every language, but today I want to share the poem written by Suraj ji with you.
Let the gold be a silver brass, and the meat offering.
Suraj sir, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to all these sportspersons and I convey my best wishes to you all for taking our flag on Rio from my side, 125 crore countrymen.
Mr.
But whenever the name of Abdul Kalam is being taken, a future picture of a capable India of science, technology and missile is shadowed in our eyes.
In that way, what kind of efforts your government is making to realize the dreams of Abdul Kalam
And if we want to compose our footprints then research and innovation must certainly be done, these are the lives of technology.
If the studies and innovations are not created, the same way technology will become a burden for us in the stagnant water.
If we don't do research and innovation, if we depend on old technology, then we will be transformed into a changing age
Therefore, the government has been making several efforts to sow the milk of science, technology and the dairying of research in the minds of our young people.
That's why I am here to innovate and aim to build innovations.
This means Atal Innovation Mission when I say AIM.
If we want to build innovators for the next generation, then we have to connect our youngsters with this scheme.
That is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such software centres are set up in schools, 10 lakh rupees will be provided and another 10 lakh rupees will be provided for maintenance in 5 years.
Likewise, innovation is directly linked to the Collection Incubation Center.
If we have a powerful incubation centre, then we have a necessary system to create innovations, to carry out tests for start-ups and to integrate them.
While it is essential to set up a new centre, it is also important to strengthen the old centres.
Our eyes face difficulties in everyday life.
Now we have to find technology solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have called upon the younger generations of the country to take the help of technology to solve the problems faced by you.
The Government of India wants to encourage and extend special awards to technologies to solve our problems.
When we talk about the Tinkering Lab, it is heartening to note that more than 13000 schools have applied and when we talk about the Centre of Action, more than 4000 institutions without academic and education have come forward to set up such centres.
I am convinced that Abdul Kalam is the real hope that we can offer to the researchers, innovation, and technology to find solutions to the problems we face in our daily lives and simplify our difficulties.
The more our younger generation pays attention to these things, the greater their role in cooking the modern India of the 21st century, this will be the real satisfaction that we can pay for the memories of Abdul Kalam.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worried about famine in our minds and now we are enjoying rain, while news of floods is also coming.
The State Governments and the Central Government are working together with the shoulders to help the flood victims.
Even if there are some difficulties due to the rains, there is flux in every human mind, because there is rain and agriculture at the centre of all our economic activities.
Sometimes the diseases that make us unhappy throughout our lives are beating us.
But if we are awake, if we are awake then the ways and ways from them are easy.
We'll take dengue fever.
We can save us from dengue fever.
Even if all the government, hospitals and doctors are doing their jobs, we should not allow dengue in our homes, in our families, in our families, and there should not be any water-related disease. This is what I request you all.
My dear countrymen, I want to reflect your attention on one more issue.
If life becomes as urgent and fast as it is, then in some cases it becomes impossible for us to think about us.
If you want some moments, you can get relief, but you must stop the habit of taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
If the doctor recommends taking 15 antibiotic pills in 5 days, please complete the recommendation in the dates given by the doctor.
If we leave no longer necessarily healthy, it benefits the intellectual reproductive organisms and becomes stronger.
We call it antibiotic resistance in the medical dimension, so how important is the use of antibiotics
Government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You might have noticed that the antibiotics sold at present have been drawn on the bed with a red lamp on the bed, it is an awareness for you.
When we talk about health, I want to add one more thing to it.
The health of the pregnant mothers in our country is very worried at times.
Every year about 3 crore women in our country are pregnant, but some mothers die during childbirth and some infants die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child die.
Whatever is the fact that in the last decades, the death rate of mothers has declined, even today, we are still incapable of saving the lives of pregnant mothers.
It is unknowingly unknowingly difficult for their lives in pregnancy, post-bleeding, infections related to pregnancy and high blood pressure.
In keeping with all this, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshi Matrutva Abhiyan, the Safe Maternity Scheme of the Prime Minister.
Can my medical brothers and sisters not dedicate themselves to this work for 12 days in a year for the poor
Many people have written a letter to me in the past.
I believe that you will definitely join you in this.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is focusing on climate change, global warming and environment.
Discussions are going on between the people of the country and around the world.
India has been strengthening this idea for centuries.
In Gita Lord Krishna, Ashwatha: Sarvavrukshanam, i.e. in the trees, I am the royal tree.
It is said that there is no vegetation without any medicinal qualities, either through nutrition or destruction.
The example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, attracted my attention, this year is my heart.
It is said that the trees do the obligations of Makkatselva even in the heavens of Mahabharata, and Sonal has accepted the challenge of fulfilling the aspirations of his parents and the entire society.
Krishi Khandu Maruti Mahadre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junner Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra
Many people are making such efforts.
During the period when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I have seen a large number of pilgrims visiting the Amba Devi Temple during the month of Bhadra.
Once a social service organisation has provided a tree plant to those who visit Koyal, and if you go and plant it in your village, mother Amba will continue to give you her blessings.
Several hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries who were present in that year had planted hundreds of thousands of trees.
Even temples can start the tradition of providing trees in the rainy season instead of the Prasad.
This can lead to a mass movement related to planting.
I once again ask my farmer brothers why shouldn't we plant a tree tree instead of wasting our land on the borders of our farmlands
Today, we have to import a single tree from abroad to build houses, chairs etc. in India.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert area.
There too, a large number of forest mahotsav has been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
It is not a small thing that between 25 million trees in Rajasthan.
Those who knew about the land of Rajasthan know how big a challenge this is.
A resolution to increase green coverage by 50 by 2029 has been taken up in Andhra Pradesh.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular tradition.
This year, projects have been devised in many ways like Mamar Forest, Ekada Forest and Shaheed Forest in Gujarat, in which several crore trees have been planted.
As a foreign tour, multilateral agreements are being carried out in a number of fields such as Rajarima Diplomacy, Unconstitutional Diplomacy, Trade Discussions and Security Dialogues.
But for me, the South African journey is in a way similar to a pilgrimage.
It is natural that when we think of South Africa, the memories of Gandhians and Nelson Mandela are raised in mind.
When the words of Akims, Love and Forgiveness fall in the ears, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela will be seen before us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I visited Phoenix and the place where Gandhians lived is called Sarvodaya.
I got the good opportunity to visit the Petersburg railway station where Gandhiji travelled and wherever the train had sown the seeds that would transform Mohandas into Gandhians.
This time I had the opportunity to meet many great personalities who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-25 years with him in prisons.
In a way, they had sacrificed their entire youth, and I had the greatest opportunity to visit the great men of Nelson Mandela, Ahmad Katha ji, Laloo (ChristianEBA), Shiba ji, George Besos and Ronnie Casters.
When I was speaking to them, when I was listening to their prison experiences, no bitterness was found in their minds, no sorrow was visible.
The feeling of equality and equality of all of us leads us towards a bright future.
Come, let us be proud of these Indians who have lived the original mantras of our lives even in South Africa.
Recently, I read in a news article that a woman, who was caught on the fraud and cheating email web, lost 11 lakh rupees and suicidally committed suicide.
I am extremely sad about his family status as a woman.
I want to know what your idea is about such fraudulent emails.
A new strategy of using technology is spreading across the world.
How technology plays a big role in the economic system, its misuse is increasing.
It was mentioned that at the time of retiring and finishing the marriage of the daughter, the person who had built a house on his own, had given you a huge amount from abroad, if you want to achieve this, put 2 lakh rupees in the bank accounts for the customs solution. This person, without thinking of anything, took 2 lakh rupees in his life and sent it to a man who was not known.
Anyone can create a fake leather bed and send it through it, get your Debit card number and Debit card number and clean your bank accounts through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I believe that we should be cautious of ourselves from this conflict, if such letters come, then we should immediately share them with our knowledgeable friends and help them get awareness.
My dear countrymen, when the Parliament session is going on, I have the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
I had a comfortable experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Alikar came and met me.
The enthusiasm of the student was fleeing, bringing a huge album, enjoying their faces.
They brought with them films that have made the Aligarh railway station beautiful.
They had built a layer garden constructed by plastic bottles at the railway station and created a new look at the station.
If you also have the opportunity to visit Aligarh, you must visit the railway station.
Now I have such information about several railway stations in India that people from those areas are enjoying their local architecture on the walls of railway stations.
A new feeling can be felt.
This is an example of how people can transform through participation.
My congratulations to all those involved in this kind of work in the country, especially to my friends of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of several festivals starts in our country with the rainy season.
You and your homes and publications will be celebrating.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is very important.
Like last year, during the Rakshabandhan period, will you not give the mothers and sisters of the country the Prime Minister's Life Insurance Scheme or Jeevan Jyoti Jeevan Jyoti Jeevan
Sympathizers, brothers and sisters, in life, give a prize in a really safe and secure manner.
Why, we might have put a woman in our homes to cook food and do household jobs, or she might be the daughter of a poor mother.
Is it not possible that during this Rakshabandhan festival, they can also get the Prime Minister's Life Security Scheme or Jeevan Jyoti Jeevan Jyoti Yellow Insurance Scheme.
My dear countrymen, many of us would have been born after the independence of the country.
We can create such an environment.
Freedom is not a programme of governments, it should be of the people of the country.
Like Deepavali, we must celebrate this festival as our festival.
Together with the vision of patriotism, I would like to do something positive.
You can tell it to the people of the country and I appeal to you to make it clear from the Red Fort.
I don't want the comments from the Red Fort to be the Prime Minister.
These are the sentiments of 125 crore people from the Red Fort.
Many people are planning on holidays.
Awareness has spread in many villages
Someone told me a few days ago that the village people and the village people of Hivre Bajar village Panchayat of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra have emotionally approached the water problem.
There may be many villages that want to save water, but after talking to the farmers, they changed the entire cropping pattern and cultivation system.
They decided that the crops which are used in excessive water should not be harvested or harvested.
What is easy to ask, but this is not so easy.
But look at my farmer brothers, they have left immediately after they don't want black money because they need more water for sugarcane.
They used to cultivate fruits and vegetables all over the world, i.e., cropping only what is required in the least quantity of water.
They have succeeded in their own endeavour to tackle the problem of water through several initiatives such as sprinkling water, irrigation, rain water recharging, rain water recharge.
Well, I have spoken of a small village, Hivere Bajar, but there are many villages like this.
I convey my best wishes to such villagers for your excellent work.
Someone told me about the GORVA Gram Panchayat in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh.
When the Indian government brings water to Latur through railways, I think it is a message to the world.
It is the human nature to feel that if there is a good news from somewhere, the entire embarrassment is lost.
I feel a very happy news from the news that this time there is a possibility of rainfall from 106 to 110 percent.
Even though there is still a rainy season, news of good rainfall has also been added to freshness.
But my dear countrymen, however enjoying the good rainfall, it also creates opportunities and challenges.
Whether we cannot start a village-dripping movement
Farmers need soil and this is helpful for them in the field of crops.
Why shouldn't we put the soil on the lakes of the villages in the dustbins
When the soil of the fields will grow, the level of water storage will also increase.
What if you fill stones and soil in empty cement sauces and empty urumatab bags and put them on the exit routes
Whenever I tell you one thing, whenever we go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, we can see different places there, one of them is to see.
It means that how they had constructed ponds at the bottom of the house 200 years ago to save water, how clean it was.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come and several schemes have come up, the money spent so that it is natural to raise such questions in the minds of crores of people in the country like brother Kumar Krishna.
Religious people consider Ganga as a means of providing housing.
The Ganga itself gives us a job and it is the Ganga that gives us the power to live.
Just as the Ganga's pilgrimage gets a boost in the economic activity of the country.
A Bakirathan brought us the Ganges, but several crores of alchemists are required to save it.
People cannot succeed in the work without contribution, so we all have to become change apps for cleanliness and cleanliness.
Repeat and remind us of this thing.
Several initiatives are being taken by the government.
Efforts are being made to seek full cooperation from all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to integrate social and hygienic institutions.
Several measures have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, hygiene and industrial pollution.
Solid wastes are being mixed in large quantities every day through canals.
In the days to come, projects to remove this waste will be implemented in many more places, the people of Ganga-Yamunotri will be able to enjoy the benefits of this.
I feel that there will be good results through this too.
It gives me great pleasure that some officials have told me that the expulsions from the Vadodara in the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have been successful in the last few days as ero Liquid Discharge, i. e.
The expulsion of black liquid from paper plants has almost come to an end.
This shows us that we are travelling in the right direction, there has been an increase in awareness.
If anyone from the far-flung southern part meets not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the banks of the Ganges, they are asking if the Ganga is not clean.
This is a matter of confidence of the people, it will certainly bring success in cleaning the Ganga.
People are offering themselves to clean the Ganga.
The system is being implemented in a very smooth manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
We celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April, today on 24th April, we are celebrating the Panchayati Raj Day.
This is a good thing that has been happening today, whichever person has given us the Constitution of India, from his birth anniversary to the greatest combined villages of the Constitution, and this has been a concept of collaboration with the State Governments of India, from 14th April to 24th April, the mission of Gramodya to Bharat Udayam for 10 days.
Today, in April 24th, I have celebrated Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand, where our majority tribal brothers and sisters live. This movement has created a huge awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at all corners of India at village level
How to make villages self-reliant
How do the villages lay the foundation for their development projects
Several programmes in many villages of India may have taken place in ten days, which may be less.
I convey my best wishes to all the state governments and village leaders who have used this opportunity for the welfare of the villages, for the development of villages and for the development of the villages in a very innovative way.
There is awareness in the villages, that is the guarantee of Indian Origin.
The source of Bharat Uday is in rural Uday
Therefore, all of us are focusing on rural upliftment and we will be able to achieve the desired results.
There has been a need for development in the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if every family has the first dream of a mother's father, then it should provide quality education to the children.
The idea of home, vehicle etc. is after all.
This feeling of the people of the country like India is progressing, this is the biggest strength.
Therefore, the application that I have placed to all the parents is to take a little time in detail and talk about the practices of the schools.
If something gets up in mind then go to school and ask the teachers.
This awareness must be the way of reducing the various disorders in our education system from the contribution of the people.
All the governments in our country have been focusing more on education and every government has made efforts on its own.
It is also true that there has been considerable time for our people to set up educational institutions, to expand the education system, to set up schools, colleges, to incorporate teachers and to go to school.
In a way, the effort to spread education was predominant, and it was also necessary.
However, the importance of expansion is more important than that on the development of our education system.
We have done the biggest task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primary objective is to provide good education to all through academic movement.
What is true is that we have to make a long-standing journey.
But if the people of 125 crore countrymen decide, a long journey will also be possible.
It is very important that we have to make fundamental changes according to Sharmila ji.
Indias universities must become globally competitive universities.
The importance of education is equally important, the role of technology in education is going to be immense.
I am confident that this far-reaching education and technology will make our education easier and in a short span of time its results will start to appear in the eyes.
Greetings to the Prime Minister, I speak to Mona Karna from Bijnor.
In today's era, sports is even more important than education for the youth.
It is important to have team spirit and sensitivity and be a good leader, so that there is a complete development of them.
I am saying this through my experience because I have been in the Bharat Anusar Abhiyan, it has had a good impact in my life.
This required greater coordination.
Their widespread widespreadness gave me heartfelt congratulations and they were very excited and had to do something.
I know that once I was a shield in the National Students' Force, a new outlook is being created through such organizations.
I have enjoyed the benefits of my childhood. I want to fill up a new energy and give a new impetus to these institutions.
This time I have a few things in front of them.
During this season, I asked why our youth and all the organisers should not be involved in the massive task of water conservation.
How many circles, how many districts can we stop open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about the thing that we all have to think.
I also see this as a shocking thing.
You will be aware that the political situation in our country was the same as the discussion of the last several elections that how many parties would provide gas cylinders.
On the other hand, economists were pressurizing to reduce subsidies, which led to the formation of several groups and suggestions and decisions on subsidies reduction.
These groups have spent several crores of rupees in operation.
But today my throne is immersed in the pride of my countrymen.
But in the account, more than 80 percent of these one crore people went to the distributors themselves, stayed in the queue, gave their subsidies in a written form.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives a slight relaxation in some tax system, it will shower appreciation for the government in television and newspapers throughout the week.
Because they have forced political leaders to think in a new perspective.
At the same time, it has forced the country's economists to think in a new way.
Even the world's economists, who present a variety of possibilities, have made it a phenomenon beyond their minds.
We have to think about it at some point.
The extraordinary thing is that the abandonment of one crore families, the availability of gas cylinders for one crore poor families instead of them, the surplus funds that are left out of one crore families, and if we look at them in a very simple way, how much we can accomplish when we believe and act on the people.
I urge all the political leaders to say something by trusting people wherever we go.
You can get the benefits you cannot even think.
We have to move in this direction.
For example, why should the 3rd Status and 4th Statistics conduct a fair examination and why shouldn't we trust their selection marks
Even if I can make an announcement that there will be no ticket checkers on some railway lines.
We will trust the people of the country and we will be able to do many such tests.
Once we trust the people of the country, there will be terrible benefits.
This situation has not been created by some political leaders, but one crore families of the country have been created.
Ravi has written to me - Good News everyday, good evening and tell your officials that every day you should tell about a good thing.
Breaking news are reported to be a bad news in every newspaper and the media.
Is there no good thing happening in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper had sent me a letter, saying that we will not even release a bad news on Monday, and we will release a positive message.
What is the truth is that there has been an atmosphere of positive news.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be available to everyone.
Whatever a well-known person gives a good information, however beautiful it is, however sensible it can be explained in a better way, it can benefit from better news.
Good news is fond of good work.
The more we strengthen the good, the less the place for evil is the truth.
And if we lift up the fire, the darkness shall depart automatically, and shall surely depart.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji, you have given good advice but please don't be angry with me.
Together with us, we will take positive steps, we will take part in the efforts to bring positive things and positive things.
Kumbh Mela is the speciality of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be a tourist attraction.
Many of the world's people are unaware that millions of people come to the bank of the river for several days.
The festival is celebrated in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events formally accomplish immense standards in terms of peoples participation in the agenda of programme management.
For the past two days, I have been listening to several films related to the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I want the tourism sector of the State Governments and the tourism sector of the Government of India to hold a photo competition.
You can urge people to give you the best photos.
This can definitely be done.
When the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, he told me that special attention has been paid to cleanliness.
Cleanliness is not only in this festival but also in the minds of the people.
While I accept that during Kumbh Mela, a festival related to spirituality, I think that too can become a social opportunity.
We can use the Kumbh Mela to spread the message of water conservation and how we can enhance our love for water.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Even though I see you speaking to me, I urge you to dedicate your thoughts and expressions to yourself.
Last time I had spoken about a book containing the stories of Bremsand ji and whoever reads it, you must share your thoughts with the Narendra Modi App.
A large number of people have put forward their views on books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and living standards.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
I will definitely talk about some other books.
But nowadays I don't get enough time to read more books.
But I feel that we have to take forward the experience that has been achieved in the last one month.
Friends, what was the truth about water conservation in my heart - but before that also a matter of water conservation seems to me as a matter of great favour to the common man.
If there is a thing that has been embracing the entire country for a few days, it is water.
Several serious efforts are being made to mitigate water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
The media has also stepped up several hundred missions related to water conservation.
I am happy to learn that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state of the Northeast, has created a water policy for itself.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
In Haryana, farmers are being encouraged to cultivate low-water and non-affective crops.
Why should we not use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm
And, in particular, the achievements of the children, their achievements and their achievements give us enthusiasm and new energy.
And the things which I say now may bring you glory and joy together.
We all know how much a word called cancer can produce in the world.
The ten children have not only surpassed cancer in their struggle of life, but have also praised the name of the country because of their magnificent activities.
This month was the World Children's Winners Games World Child Winners Games in Moscow.
During this period, competitions like shooting, square, swimming, drilling, timeline, table tennis were organised.
These 10 winners of our country have won medals on this occasion and some of them have won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that the success that India has achieved in space, beyond the Chandrayaan 2 sky, will give you joy and pride.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Many such people like Arvind Rao, from different parts of the country, MyGov and MyGov have been asking them to speak on Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In terms of space, India has to say the year 2019 as a wonderful year.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March after which Chandrayaan 2.
We were unable to talk much about the great importance of A-Sat in the election process.
But the A-Sat missile is 300 km above Earth in just 3 minutes.
On July 22, the whole country was proud of the fact that Pong Chandrayaan had screwed up in 2 applications.
Chandrayaan 2- This goal is of immense importance in various dimensions.
Chandrayaan 2 will further strengthen our understanding of the moon.
Even in our lives we have to face temporary recession
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have put forward a very interesting competition for the students of the country and the youth of the country and I appeal to our youth to participate in this competition.
The knowledge of space, Indias space programme and scientific technology will be competitive of this question.
For example, what is required to be done in the rocket launch, how the artificial cells are stabilised in the surroundings, what are we receiving from the artificial intelligence and what is A-SAT
On MyGov web site, the competition will be reported on 1st August.
I invite my young friends and students wealth...
I appeal to all the schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work to win your school.
I inspire all the student wealth to join it.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum number of students in each state to Sriharikota at their own expense.
Moreover, they will also get the opportunity to see Chandrayaan landing scenes in the area of land in September.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given a boost to the cleanliness drive in a number of times
Likewise, the efforts being made for cleanliness have also been inspired by the voice of the mind.
The journey that began five years ago today has set new standards of cleanliness with the help of everyones contribution.
I have not said that we have achieved the status of cleanliness but the success of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan from the habit of toilets in the open, the strength of the 130 crore countrymen, from the habit of toilets to the public.
But we are not going to stop with this.
This movement is now moving towards beauty from a ruthless state.
Just a few days ago, I had come to know through the media about Yogesh Saini and his groups.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer, who is returning to the country to serve Mother India after quitting his job in the US.
Just a while ago, he had made Delhi clean, not only beauty-filled, but also a challenge.
He joined his group and began his work from the dustbins in Lodhi Carton.
You might remember how the streets of Prayag kingdom were filled with paintings on the Kumbh.
I also came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team had shown their captivity there.
We also feel this in the beauty of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
The principle of wealth from waste must be strengthened in our society, it must be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had read an interesting comment in MyGov.
Muhammad Aslam, who lives in Shobian area of Jammu Kashmir, has registered this.
I like the Mann Ki Baat.
I am very happy to note that I have contributed positively to the Grameen Return in my state of Jammu Kashmir.
The programme was organised in June.
I think this is the first action plan that people directly infiltrate with the government.
Several more things have been added to this programme to make it more interesting.
Under the Khelo India programme, sports competitions have been organized for children.
They were given sports equipment, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Certificates, Listed and Tribal Certificates.
In a way, this organisation, the festival of development, the celebration of public participation, is a celebration of public awareness.
People participated in large numbers in this development festival of Kashmir.
While it is a matter of joy that the events of the Grameen Abhiyan had been done in the villages, the government officials reached such far-flung villages on difficult hills and walked on foot for a couple of days.
These officers also visited the border villages of Sadasar and beyond the border and travelled without any fear for the most troubled areas of Shobian, Bulwama, Kulkanv and Anantnag districts.
The reception given to them has affected so many officers that they have spent more than two days in these villages.
Organizing Gram Sabha Meetings in these areas, ensuring a large number of peoples participation and setting up their own plans.
New determination, new zeal and wonderful results.
This makes it clear that those who seek to sow hurdles and barriers in the journey of development will never succeed.
My dear countrymen, how did Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandra Ji, who was awarded the Gyanpeeth Award, have written about Maritime in one of his poems
People from different cultures and languages across India have celebrated Maritime in their own way.
If we have seen us around in this season, the earth will be seen as if we had fought some green war on it.
On the four sides, a new force is stirring up.
In this sacred month many devotees take refuge, and take the pilgrimage of Amarnath, and many are hungry, and with great enthusiasm wait for festivals like Janmashtami, Naga Panchmi.
This is the time when Raksha Bandhan is also present as a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
When we talk about Maritime, this time we will be happy to know that more than 4 years of devotees have been participating in the Amarnath Yatra.
From 1st July till now more than 3 lakh devotees have visited the sacred Amarnath cave.
The total number of people who participated in this 60-day pilgrimage in 2015 is more than that in just 28 days.
I would like to extend my special felicitations to the people of Jammu Kashmir and their hospitality on the back of the victory of Amarnath Yatra.
All those who have completed their journey have been attracted by the hospitality and hospitality of the people of the state.
All this will be very useful for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttarakhand this year's pilgrimage has started and more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath in just half a month.
For the first time since the horrific natural disaster in 2013, people have made a pilgrimage to such a great number of achievements.
I urge you all to visit some places of beauty in the monsoon season, wherever you are in the country.
Nobody else can be greater than the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage to see such beautiful places of our country.
Let us give you new energy, new hopes and new aspirations in this beautiful and vibrant month of Maritime.
Likewise, in August, the White House is following the memories of the movement.
On the other hand, there is a heavy flood in different parts of the country and people of many parts of the country have been affected by floods.
When we see the rain on television, we only get a glimpse of it - the floods, the floods, the waters and the transportation stagnant.
I will come back after waiting for a month.
Today, people from all over the world from Christianity will be celebrating Easter.
Today, when India is accompanied by Australia, I convey my best wishes to both the soldiers.
India won gold medals in 1951 and 1962 in the 1956 Olympics.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been pushing the rankings to the lowest level.
Today, if our position in the FIFA's rankings has fallen, it's difficult to say that it's going to leave the mouth.
Today, I have seen that the interest of Indian youth is increasing in their footprints, be it EPL or Spanish League, as well as the Super League of India.
The youngsters of India are watching television television to know more about football.
At the same time, we can utilize this opportunity and try to take football to every village and every street.
If there is such an opportunity for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup, then in this year, we must try to create a new zeal and innovation amongst the youngsters around the world.
I consider this as an opportunity to brand India globally.
My student wealth, you must have planned to visit tourism on holidays.
Most people go abroad for 5 days and 7 days in their respective states.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
It is doubtful if there is a district which I do not go to India.
There is a huge power for tourism in creating our lives. Nowadays, the youth of India are very enthusiastic about tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They do not travel in the old way, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think this is a good sign.
There is also a case in our area that if the coal is blackened, the others themselves will run away.
But it is a pleasure to create a tourist circuit by keeping the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far more than ten thousand people have enjoyed coconut miner tourism for the environment near Sawaner village near Nagpur.
This creates an opportunity to see a new one.
When you go to other places during this holiday, can you contribute towards cleanliness
This may not be done very scientifically, but what happens is true.
Can you also act as a tourist with a strong collaboration on the idea of cleanliness at the tourist destination
In comparison to the world, tourism is far behind in India.
But if 125 crore people decide to strengthen our tourism sector, then we can attract the world.
Come, let us move in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like that the holidays have come and gone.
Consider this attitude too.
Can we waste your holidays, the great years of life, the moments of their importance
I'll give you an idea of your skin.
Can you develop a capability during your holidays and enhance your governance by adding a new thing
If you don't know swimming then you can decide if I will learn swimming during the holidays or if I don't know the cycling then I will learn cycling.
Even today, if I typically yield two fingers, can I do a plaque training
How many capabilities are there to develop our governance
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our grievances
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Now think about this, there is no need for greater exercises, no trainer is required, no higher fee is required, no big cost is spent.
This will be the case with other friends.
I am sure you will do this and tell me what you have learnt newly.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
Greetings to you, Prime Minister, during the last summer vacation, you have been saying that the birds and birds should warm up, so we should keep water in the balcony or in the house floor for them so that they can get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, through which my friendship with a lot of birds bloomed.
This time again I request you to express this in your minds voice.
He has telephoned me and reminded me of a good job.
I was asking you to fill your house with soil pots in the summer.
Abhi told me that he is doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds love him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the greatest poets of the world in Hindi literature, was immensely immersed in birds.
In his poems, I will not allow you to go away, I will fill you with cereals, and I will finish the cool lime water everywhere.
Shilpa Kuoke from Mysore put forward a very nice idea.
Have we ever given them drink water
Shilpa, my sincere thanks to you, you have put forward the most emotional thought in a very natural manner.
My farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people can think of this digital India as a matter of some urban youth.
If you supply the App for these farmers in your mobile phone, all the information related to agriculture and climate will be available in your hand.
What is the situation in the markets, what is the situation in the markets, what is the trend of good harvest, what kind of pesticides can be obtained from it.
If you ask them any questions, they answer it or make you understand it.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want these farmers to get App in their mobile phones for their convenience.
We have taken the initiative to create wealth for water conservation through Manrekha.
The villages that have created such awareness in the country may be many, the farmers of the forefront may be many, the citizens with many awareness.
I welcome this.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
Statistics show that 3 percent of casualties are due to diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types, one type 1 and the other type 2.
Type 1 is a hereditary and the child is born because of the mother's father.
Type 2, because of habits, because of age, because of obesity.
As the world is concerned about diabetes, the 7th World Health Day Centre has established this centre.
Our lifestyle is a big reason for this.
Body labour is decreasing.
Can we take steps to defeat diabetes in our lives by the 7th of April
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get a medical check-up with difficulty.
It is known that after the situation has worsened, there has been diabetes for a long time.
Our country is less than the number of tuberculosis patients in other countries.
This disease can be ended by proper treatment.
India must be freed from the grip of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated only by governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I urge the people of the country to eradicate diabetes and eliminate tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, several important events are being held in April, particularly on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated across the country throughout the year.
I have had the privilege of visiting the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us all that is necessary to become a better citizen.
We can enjoy a great homage to him by traveling through his path and living as a good citizen.
Vikram will start the year in a few more days.
New Year is being celebrated in different forms in different states.
My New Year greetings to all
I had said this thing in the past that whenever you want to hear the voice of my mind, you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask it at a comfortable time.
You can hear it in your mobile phone.
I am happy to join you.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
I convey my best wishes to all for the Easter Festival.
My young friends, all of you will be on the one hand in the election.
There is a wonderful inspiration.
You may be aware that India is going to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year in 2017.
What I mean to say is to insist that the interest on footprints increases, but do we make our obligations when we lay the doors of India
Last time also I had an appeal to you that wherever you are going, give the photo of that place.
Whatever work is not done by the tourism department, what kind of work is not done by our cultural department, what kind of work has been done by the State Governments and the Government of India, the work has been done by crores of people of the country.
Looking at the photographs they've done, it's really enjoyable.
We have to take this task forward and do this thing as well, but do something else this time.
Not just sending photos, but also showcase your creation, you can find a lot of things when you go to new places.
India is a country of diversity.
If you start traveling once, you will be traveling throughout your life, you will be enjoying yourself.
In general, we should stay away from coal mines.
When we look at the films of the people there, we will consider what will happen
I am confident that my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Let us all work together, be it the government, the institutions, the society, the citizens and all of us.
Your governance will be marked by this and your self-confidence will increase considerably.
They are selling milk near our homes, news paper sellers, postalists are coming, sometimes sellers and brass sellers are passing through.
Have we ever asked if you want to wipe out their thirst when the heat of summer is shining
Only then can one drop of rain water be used wastely.
The beginning of farming for farmers is one of the most important.
But we should also think of what happens if there is no water.
You might have noticed that this time 5 lakh lakes and irrigation lakes are taking the initiative.
I still remember that as soon as I heard the name of DB, at my young age, people are scared.
If you get rid of tuberculosis then right treatment is important and complete treatment is important .
If you leave half the treatment in the middle, the disease will come back.
Give me myself your feet, whenever you get a chance, you can enquire about the voices of the old mind and ask them in your language.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
In a way, this is my concluding Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be held in 2016.
In a way, we can say that every festival leaves the hopes of the next festival.
Sometimes India can also say that it is the fastest growing economy of the festivals.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the people below the society.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country for the Christmas Festival and convey my best wishes for the coming year 2016.
Let us bring a lot of joy and joy to all of you in 2016, let us take a new zeal, a new zeal and a new determination to take you all to new heights.
Let the world become warm, natural calamities and the embarrassment caused by man.
What else can be a greater happiness than this, the human society must live a peaceful and well-being by salvation from all these
Sawley Chawker ji is a tourist season, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists visiting various places for Christmas festivals
I welcome Ganesh ji's views on India as clean as our tourist destinations are.
I am taking the ideas of Ganesh ji among the people.
If there are guests in our homes, then we are engaging in cleaning and cleaning the house immediately.
Similarly, we have to keep our tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations clean and clean.
I am happy that there are reports from across the country about cleanliness.
I have been conveying my best wishes to the media friends for this thing since the beginning.
Because they are taking away small and good things and bringing them to the public eye.
I want to share with you the message that he has built 100 toilets only in the village of Bhojpura, considering that this work is extremely sacred.
The country is progressing at a rapid pace due to the continuous efforts of many.
125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of progress with their shoulders and the country is progressing.
Excellent education, improved skills and increasing employment opportunities
Life insurance schemes for the citizens, banking facilities, globalisation of business without waste and setting up of new entrepreneurs.
Now all the people of the simple family who cannot even go near the banks can easily get loans through Mudra Yojana.
Nowadays, Indians have begun to understand that the milk of Yoga has started to grow all over the world.
When the entire world celebrated the International Day of Yoga, we all had the feeling of how proud our country was.
This feeling will only happen when our thoughts and thoughts are in a big way.
And it came to pass, when his mother opened the mouth of Jashoth, that he opened it, who could forget what she saw there the trumpets
Similarly, Yoga Day has made us feel the significance of India as Indians.
Nowadays talk of cleanliness is echoing in every household.
This is also a great advantage for the government officials who are working on bringing electricity to those villages, the feeling that they have been the cause of a change in the lives of a farmer, the poor, the youth and the mother.
Couldn't I do everything alone
But when I talk about this, should I not contribute to my contribution
Even a simple citizen can join me by offering an App in his mobile phone Narendra Modi.
I am sharing simple things in this regard.
It is a matter of happiness for me that people also share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us together involve things related to the interests of the common man, let us introduce them to the common man, let us introduce them to the right thing, let us introduce them to the right thing.
My young friends, on 15th August, I presented a basic idea of Start Up India, Stand Up India from the Red Fort.
After that, the idea of this has been intensified in all the departments of the government.
Can India become Start Up Capital
Start up India and Stand up India have brought a great opportunity to the younger community.
My young friends, the Government of India is launching the Startup India and Stand up India on 16th January at full swing.
We have a sustained view of start-ups that start-ups are the only people in the digital world and IT sector.
We have to make changes in the context of India's needs.
The intellectual potential of our younger generation is spread all over the country.
This start-up India and stand-up India should not exceed some of the cities, it should spread to the surroundings of India.
Therefore, I request all the State Governments to take this project forward.
On 16th January, I will definitely share with you in detail about this.
I look forward to your views.
My young friends, on January 12, Swami Vivekananda's birthday.
Like me, there are crores of people in this country.
From 1995 to January 12, we are celebrating Swami Vivekananda Jayanti on National Youth Day.
The celebrations are scheduled to take place in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from January 12 to January 16 this year.
I especially urge my young friends to send your comments directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand what is in your mind.
Dilip Chouhan, from Ahmedabad in Gujarat, was an immensely visually impaired person, who observed the Accessible India Day in his school.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
Sometimes when we meet human beings like him in our lives, there is a collective feeling in our minds.
The outlook of humans like him will be based on our thoughts.
There is no doubt that I have a great significance for words.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission, arrangements were made to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, particularly in Chennai, I had to go there because of the horrific floods, I could not participate in this programme.
Despite being unable to participate in this programme, the thoughts related to it were emerging in my mind.
Need for innovations, technology, systems needed and understanding to simplify schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, easily accessible automobiles, libraries and languages.
They shall not die in the candlesticks.
Is not the plans that were made for the common man and the poor
A few days back, efforts were made to bring the beneficiaries the benefits of the scheme in a simple manner.
The subsidy is being given to the gas cylinders in our country.
Crores of rupees are spent on this, but no account has been filed for this.
Whether or not the subsidy reaches the real beneficiaries or whether it reaches the right time, the government has made a small difference in the supply of subsidies.
About 15 crore people are the beneficiaries of the Pahal Gas Yojana by the end of November.
These 15 crore beneficiaries are directly subsidized to the bank accounts of beneficiaries.
This is happening without intermediaries, CIPARISO and the possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the Mission for Aadhaar ID, on the other hand, Jan Dhan account opening, on the other hand, on the other hand, the Central State Governments are working together to prepare the list of beneficiaries and link it with Aadhaar ID and Bank Accounts.
There were solid allegations regarding this scheme.
In many places, money is being directly placed on the bank accounts of the workforce.
So far, about Rs. 40,000 crore has been directly deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries regarding about 35,40 projects.
My dear countrymen, on January 26, a golden moment for the Republic of India.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji was the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to take this forward.
Only during the elections, there will be a lot of advertising and writing on the walls and laying the stairs.
But why shouldn't we talk about the same duties every day
When we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar this year, can we organise a competitive competition in schools, colleges, in our villages and cities, in different societies and associations, in poetry competitions, poetry competitions and negotiating competitions
When 125 crore people of the country are taking one step after the other with a sense of obligation, then see what kind of great heritage will be built.
On 26th January, when we celebrate the Republic Day, cant we clean and decorate the silver statues of the leaders of our city and the places surrounding it very well through our citizens, through the medium of schools and colleges
I have put forward the idea of doing this as a citizen.
We express ourselves afterwards in maintaining the idols of those leaders whom we feel very emotional in setting up the idols.
Can we continue to clean ourselves as a society and as a nation
On 26th January this year, we will join together in this effort.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes for 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the beginning of the Christmas festival will continue.
There is a separate place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes festivals are also useful for injury, sometimes they give a new impetus.
But sometimes when there is trouble in the days of the festival, they are very sad.
From every corner of the world, there have been constant reports of natural disasters.
Until now, there are reports of disasters even without questioning.
Now we are enjoying how fast the impact of climate change is spreading.
The State Governments are engaged in rescue and difficult relief operations in full swing.
The central government has always worked shoulder to shoulder.
I firmly believe that even after all these difficulties, Tamil Nadu will again progress rapidly and will contribute to the progress of the country.
But there is a feeling of a change in the face of such a terrible situation on the four sides.
Until about 15 years ago, the natural calamity had been associated with the agriculture sector because at that time the natural calamity was only with drought and famine.
Governments, people's society, citizens, small and large organizations have to work in the field of scientific development.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had interacted with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I suggested that the South Asian countries, together, take up a joint activity in preparation for disaster response.
I am glad that a seminar on this topic and a seminar on the best ways to combat the disaster has been held in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I am Luckwinder Singh from Jalandar in Punjab.
We are engaged in organic farming and guiding many more in agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are doing organic farming
It is also a matter of great happiness that you are not only able to do this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concerns are justified, but this does not happen in the states of Punjab and Haryana alone.
This is our usual practice all over India. This is our tradition that we are burning the agricultural wastes that have come after the cultivation.
Earlier all of us were unaware of the evils caused by this kind of burning, so I am doing it.
This continued and grew due to these things and today it was associated with climate change.
After the impact of this embarrassment began to reach the cities, the voices of the people started shouting.
That's the real concern you've expressed.
Our agricultural friends should be trained in the first phase and they should explain the truth.
This can save time by burning the post-harvest agricultural wastes, reduce the difficulty and make the land ready for the next one.
But this is not the right procedure.
The post-harvest agricultural wastes are also very costly.
They are naturally fertile.
We're wasting them.
Not only this, if we make them small pieces, they may be a guest for animals.
Secondly, due to burning them, the layer on the ground is high.
My farmer brothers and sisters, think for a moment, our bones are firm, our heart works well, our kidneys work hard, everything is fine, but if the skin on the body is burnt then can we survive
If the skin of our body is burnt down, the skin of our mother Earth burns and the layer of our soil is burnt down.
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I had an opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in the field of waste.
They shared their excellent experiences with me.
Earlier, they had to spend 5000,100,1500 rupees per hectare to remove their livelihood after harvesting their lives.
No work was going on until the tractors had to be taken away from them.
Last time I had spoken about body donation in Mann Ki Baat.
In this regard, I mentioned the NOTO free phone number.
Many prominent film personalities like Raveena Dundan have joined them.
Organ donor can save many lives.
What else can be a bigger donation than this
The National Registration Centre for Organ Transformation (NRO) with details of patients waiting for organs, organ donors, was launched on November 27.
I am confident that awareness will be widespread in this field and I believe that those who need it will get help at the right time.
This help will not be available in any way until there is no one to donate.
I had earlier said that on 3rd December we will be following the day of Divyangjans.
Physically, individuals with disabilities are brave and immensely capable.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as calciums, mind feels painful.
Sometimes there is a feeling of bitterness and compassion.
But if we change our perspective, if we correct our vision then they will become a vision for us, they will become a force for us to understand the achievements.
It is a matter of great gratitude for their determination and their ability to transform the sins and obstacles faced by them.
Today I want to talk about the 40-42 year old Javed Ahmad ji.
In 1996, terrorists shot at Javad Ahmad in Kutchmir.
But Javed Ahmad did not accept the defeat.
The wounds of radicalism did not make him coward.
There was no part of his stimulus, a person who had not committed any crime, had been punished with such a punishment, his youth was ruined, but he had no anger or grave in his mind.
Though he did not cooperate, he dedicated himself to the education of children for the last 20 years.
As a social worker, as a well-known citizen, today he is making a peaceful revolution as the sovereign of the talented.
Isn't it sufficient for all Indians to have a sense of vision
I would like to commemorate the valour of Javed ji and his dedication on the 3rd of December.
Though I have been able to talk only about Javed because of the lack of time today, even though the fires of such an inspiring vision are shining around the corner of India, they have been encouraging them to live.
Thus, on the 3rd of December, we have to draw incentives from them.
In many matters, we are obliged to work on governments.
The middle class, the lower middle class, the slaughtered, the underprivileged, the oppressed and the oppressed, are all connected to the government and the government organisations.
As an ordinary citizen, they are likely to have a bad experience with government employees in some way.
These couples are spending their wealth on the development of the poor in their retirement life.
The entire tribal population of Danteka, the smallest village in Balasore district of Odisha.
The village that is swelling in poverty is a state of being beaten by malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, a resident of this village, has decided that I will ensure that no one from this Tendka will die due to malaria.
He has stepped up the struggle against Malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
How many such bells may be in the country.
You should not only read but also recommend others.
The positive power is the greatest power.
You also share good events related to this, share these e-books and take collusions.
My dear countrymen, the world is deeply concerned with climate change.
14th December, National Energy Savings Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the Government.
The LED Pulp Mission is progressing as a focus.
Once I had said that I should embrace the street lights on the night of Poornima and wet it in full swing for an hour.
One of my friends had sent a link to me, and I got the opportunity to see it.
I felt that this should be shared with you.
He has been trying to give light to the poor using solar energy, he has been fighting with darkness, he has been working with his name and he has created a group of women.
Launder, a solar powered solar power, has launched a seminar on Electronics.
He is offering these launder lights at a cost of 100 rupees per month.
People take these lights in the evening and give them e-mail in the morning.
I am told that till I heard about 500 households are giving this kind of e-Governance to the launders.
During the day, this Nurjahan has been working towards providing e-Governance to these landlords.
But a good start has been made.
66 lakh people have received Rs. 42,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of these 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh are women.
I had earlier said that Swachh Bharat would create such entrepreneurs.
They have confirmed this in the Silesh Ponsle.
He has bought a tanker and has repaid a loan of Rs. 2 lakhs to the bank in a short time.
This is our goal of Mudra Yojana.
The same was stated in the case of Mamta Sharma from Bhopal.
He also received 40,000 rupees from the bank under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is working on a handmade job.
With no need to pay more interest, about 1000 rupees per month remains.
His family also had a good job.
But I want to make this scheme more popular and expand.
All our banks must approach this with greater understanding and come forward to help small businessmen in large numbers.
In fact, they are acting as the economic drivers of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
We want to encourage them.
Good has happened, but this should be done more and more.
This means that the pride of liberty is the pride of liberty.
The word of unity of the country should continue to shine.
But I expect more advice.
I am confident that your suggestions will certainly be beneficial.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is about to begin.
Once again my best wishes to my countrymen, Jai Hind
I once again got an opportunity to interact with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth one-day cricket competition between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
Gandhi Mandela continues to hold this 5-day cricket competition.
Therefore, interest in the final competition has increased.
My good wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I convey my congratulations to the closest friends of All India Radio.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the comrades of the Kannur Radio Station.
I once again want to mention about Kerala.
They have sent a letter to me from Dhuyam Mary Upper Primary schoolgirls from the Church of Kerala.
The letter is particular in many ways.
One, these students had registered their blankets and dressed Bharat Mata in a very big cloth.
They have sent me the map of Bharat Mata.
First of all, I was surprised that why they have finished the film with their cloth map records.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I knew how many big indexes they had sent to me.
They are engaged in the awareness movement of body organ donation.
The 80-year-old Vasant Rao Suduke Guruji has been running a movement for a long time in Maharashtra.
He says he should celebrate his body as a festival.
Nowadays, many news and information are coming to me through the phone.
Desh ji from Delhi has also sent me a message like this.
Debesh speaks from Delhi - I am happy to note that the government has taken initiatives and policies related to body donations.
It seems to me that this thing is very important that countries like China are very advanced in the matter of body organisms and that the goal of one lakh donated by the government is to be praised.
More than 12 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in a country of 125 crore people, we can only implement 5000 organ transplants.
It is necessary to give light to one million eyes every year.
But we can only pay attention to 25,000 people.
If 4 people need eyes, we can give only one such person.
Efforts have been made to guide the State Governments in this regard.
Some states have made good progress in efforts to simplify and speed up the administrative practices related to this.
I am told that Tamil Nadu is the first member of the body.
A 24-hour helpline is being served by 1800 114770.
Our ancestors have also shouted, aren't they a recipe
That is, the joy they possessed in sacrifice is through the mantras of Honey Trikatna Punjeetha.
Over the past days, Delhis G.
The operation was successful and a life was saved.
A few days later, we are also celebrating the festival of Deepavali.
We also celebrated Eid and Venkata Chaturthi festivals.
The upcoming India-Africa Forum will be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th April, 2019.
This is the first time that such a big conference will be held on Indian soil.
The leaders of 54 African countries and Unions have been invited to participate in the conference.
The population of our two countries is one third of the world.
It is said that India and Africa had been the only geography several million years ago, and later they were two parts of the Indian Ocean.
We have great solidarity.
Indias wildlife and wildlife can have many similarities.
There is great comparison in natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians live in Africa for many years.
There are links between India and Africa in the fields of economic, cultural and political.
But India is playing a bigger role in training the younger generations of African countries than all this.
More than 25,000 African students have been educated in India in human resource development and skill development.
This time, the Government of India, particularly the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has organised a very important event.
Competitions are being organised in poetry writing and enhancing their contribution amongst students of all schools connected with the CBSE.
Thousands of school students have written about information on Indian African connections.
Several lakh school students witnessed the exhibition, the people of the village saw the contribution of Gandhiji in the relationship between Africa and India, and understood how their impact was on the minds of the people of these two regions.
Several important contributions were made in this competition.
I want to read this to you because a poem is my heartbeat, it is my favorite.
I extend my felicitations to Homoeopathy and all the students participating in this competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On August 15, 2014, I mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, the Model Village Scheme of Parliament.
After that, several members of their friends have completed this task.
They are engaged in this thing with full heart.
Last month, a commentary seminar was organized in Bhopal.
In this context, the leaders of the villages, district governments, some parliamentarians and officers of the Central State Governments, all of whom were involved in a collaborative collaboration on the village scheme.
Through this, a variety of new ideas have emerged and they have been encouraged.
I would certainly like to bring some things to your attention.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal areas.
Unfortunately, it is the Mao extremists, bomb culture and massacres that we remember when we talk about Jharkhand.
Several areas have been devastated by the impact of these left-wing extremists.
However, our senior parliamentarian, Kariya Munda ji, who has been the deputy speaker of the Parliament, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started going there, he took the confidence of the people, he tried to give life to the government agencies and encouraged the officials to come and work there.
He created a country to bring about development in the region, which has long been swept away from the neglect.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Village Scheme, a successful effort to create awareness in the minds of the people has emerged in this Barsi village of Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to respected Parliamentarian Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are underway, and he has created a great innovation in this regard.
He handed over a job to students studying in schools there.
He asked the school students studying in the upper classes to study their parents in this class.
The school was in such a way educating students and their parents in the morning.
Similar children were taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
Look, without any budget, without circularity, without any special facilities, how much change has been achieved through a mere determination
This is the lesson that the Tripura Gram Panchayat gives us.
This village is known for the production of sugarcane and also for the Black Festival.
Ruwala ji started the Kalimpoth festival on 11th March in this village.
He has attracted our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I want to remind you of one thing that after the Deepavali festival last year, a movement was organised in our country, especially in the media.
Your idea is to continue this thing even after the festivals as much as we try to clean it before the festivals.
This kind of activity should be done at every public event.
I congratulate all the media of India today.
On 2nd October, when Gandhijis birth anniversary and a Swachh Bharat Mission was launched on 2nd October, it was a good opportunity to participate in the SafaiKri programme organised by India Today Group on the completion of one year.
During the last one year, he has been encouraging cleanliness related work through E-DV, and there have been reports of this in his newspapers, and he is focusing only on constructive work.
He has linked 51 lakh children from around 55 to 56,000 schools in Andhra and Telangana to Swachh Bharat Mission.
From public places, railway stations, desert places, hospitals and parks, cleanliness drive is being carried out in many places.
These reports also strengthen the building of a clean India.
ABP News Channel has launched a programme titled India My Nation.
The people of the country have sown the idea of cleanliness in their hearts, with the emphasis on the awareness of cleanliness among the people.
NDTV organised a Swachh Bharat Mission.
There are several channels and several newspapers in our country, even though I cannot mention the names of all because of lack of time, everybody has taken this movement.
Over the past several years, this village has been working as a pivot of cleanliness and every generation has been taking the issue of cleanliness drastically.
A few years ago, this village has been awarded Asia's most clean village.
I am happy that a village in Meghalaya, a remote north-eastern region of our country has been engaged in cleanliness for years.
It has become a culture of the village.
All such events give us confidence that our country is sure to be clean.
My dear countrymen, when I was speaking from Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that corruption had become cheaper in the country.
My best wishes to all my young social friends.
In the last budget, we made an important announcement.
Therefore, you can get a golden interest in the bank as you pay your money to the bank and get interest in your investment amount.
Now the gold will be in the bank, but the money will be given to you through the bank interest.
Now tell the people of the country, will the gold be supplied
Whether the unprotected gold has become the whole force of life
Don't keep gold in the house waste.
Do not miss the benefits of its safety and surroundings.
So, we will not have to buy gold, we will not have to save gold, nor will anyone sing the paper.
I am sure to dedicate this scheme of security to the people of the country next week.
However, we have been using foreign gold coins so far, or have been using foreign gold bags.
Why shouldn't there be an indigenous index for our country
Thus, in the coming week, 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka chakra will be released before the Danterus holy day.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be provided to the people.
I am sure that this new scheme will bring about a new transformation in the path of economic growth and I have full confidence in your cooperation.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was born.
When Patell, who was a concept of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, was thinking about them, the entire India would be inspired by it.
This great man has played a very important role in India's unity.
If not only these differences, the beauty that has given us pride will not come near us.
Therefore, diversities are the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the past several years, on 31st October, the solidarity drive has taken place.
I have got the opportunity to participate in it earlier.
I have been told that this time too, arrangements are being made in different areas and people are enthusiastically preparing for unity.
The movement of unity is actually a drive towards development.
In other words, the guarantee for development is the solidarity.
Come, let us pay tributes to Sardar Saheb.
We will carry forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, all of you are engaged in preparations for the Deepavali festival.
I specially urge the parents to enjoy the festival of Deepawali, but even if we do not have any harm to our children, we have to do more cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, on the next day of Diwali, I will go to Britain.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I am confident that this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be a tourist destination for them when our children go to Britain to study.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar gave us the message of learning as much as possible and livelihood for the rest of the country.
The work done by Lord Basaveswar several years ago for democracy and empowerment of women is a matter of pride for all.
The dedication of the Thiruvalluvar statue of Lord Basaveshwar in London to the people of the world is a great example of the vision and vision of the greatness of India several centuries ago.
On such an occasion, the hearts of all the people of the country are filled with cyclones.
Your suggestions have come to me through in.
Afterwards, programmes are being prepared by your letters in India Radio, government officials are being called upon to discuss and some people are trying to solve their problems while writing about their problems.
We need to learn many languages in a country like India.
It is true that even though I have learnt some languages, I cannot learn so many languages.
In your language, I will definitely try to enter your minds at 8:00 pm.
Look how close our relationship is.
The last one year was over
Today we have stepped up in a new year.
My best wishes to the people of my country once again.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all, this is the 12th episode of Mann Ki Baat.
There is a great significance for the people's power in the democracy.
I have an idea based on my life, that is why I have great faith in this people's power.
But the voice of Mann Ki Baat has taught many things, they have mixed experiences, and all of us have understood how great the power of mankind is.
Our ancestors have made it clear that the manpower of the people is the Magazine power.
I can say that keeping my experiences in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, in the minds of our ancestors, there is great power and great truth.
In this regard, I congratulate All India Radio and they have not just seen these suggestions in paper but have seen them as the expectations of the masses.
The basic principle is that information in terms of administration must be from the bottom to the bottom and the guidance must be from top to bottom.
Who would have thought that Mann Ki Baat would become an instrument of information
But that's what happened.
On 2nd October, I had said that we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Once upon a time, there were gates for the country, but shouldn't it be the doors for the fashion
No more, I said buy a little.
I am glad that in the last one year, the sale of papers has almost two roles.
It is difficult to distribute subsidies to the common man, the middle class and the middle class.
Nevertheless they shall utter this.
Isn't this a peace revolution
Isn't this the expression of the people's power
The governments should also learn the lesson that the power of the States has a huge manpower beyond the jurisdiction of power, powerful and determined action.
Whatever I had faith in, after the Mann Ki Baat, all these things have become my determination.
Therefore, today I want to convey my best wishes to the people power once again through Mann Ki Baat.
People used to think of the small things that I have spoken in a way, they used to make their own contributions for the welfare of the country and they also joined them.
What else can be enjoyable
This time I thought of handling a new approach in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I appealed to the people of the country to contact you through phone and register your questions and your suggestions.
Consultations from all parts of India have concentrated so that the calls are not coming.
This is a comfortable experience.
All the elderly have given advice.
It was easy to hear some suggestions, and my groups are paying attention to others.
You might have spoken for one and a half minutes, but for me your suggestions and messages are very important.
The government will pay full attention to your suggestions.
There is generally a negative feeling on the four sides.
But my experience is different.
Moreover, in particular, the appeals from the disabled persons received a lot of calls from the visually impaired.
They cannot see television and ask for radio.
Pawan Acharya from Alwar region of Rajasthan is sharing a message with me.
I want the people of the country to listen to their suggestions and follow them.
My name is Pawan Acharya, and I am from Alwar, Rajasthan.
During the Deepawali festival, I urge the people of the country to make use of a lot of dusty lamps and appeal to the people of the country.
Moreover, the use of soil fertilizers will not result in the pollution of the environment, but will provide employment to thousands of soil-grained poor people.
In the coming festivals, if we listen to Pawan Acharya ji's advice then soil lights will be used in our houses, but I appeal to the people of the country that its light will enter the family of the poor.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the soldiers during the Venkata Chaturthi.
After 50 years after the war with Pakistan in 1965, an exhibition meant Veerathu Panjali near India Gate in Delhi has been organized.
We have been questioning about the glorious moments of the war, the unforeseen courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, neither photographs nor films of that period.
If you want to create history then you should understand the echoes of history very well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness must be ours and we should also provide the means for it.
I don't misunderstood this.
I clearly see this thing that even the Parliament of the country is engaged in discussions on cleanliness.
On the other hand, what else can be the matter of giving pride to the country rather than the Parliament on the other hand, both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness
The movement of ideas is a climate against pollution and awakening on cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhiji said
Once he said that if I want to choose between freedom and cleanliness then I would like cleanliness first and then only the country's independence.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhiji.
Kulshan Aroda from Delhi has filed a report on mygov website.
Deendayal Upadhyay wanted to know about their century.
Even last year, several types of fashion clothes, several types of garments, but I had told them that they should be with me for letters.
I pray you, give it somewhat.
Last time you almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited from this
You have completed the work that the government has not been able to spend crores of rupees with a little help.
I once again appeal to you in this regard because this is the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, my heart is delighted even for something else.
I want to share this with you.
I went to Kolkata in May, and Subhas Bose's family had come to meet me.
His brother son Chandra Bose organised the meeting.
Chandra Bose and his family were engaged in this work, and it was decided last week that more than fifty family members of Subhash Bose are coming to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how much this is going to give me a great pleasure
Many of the family members of Subhash Babu live in other countries.
Is it a matter of great joy that everyone is coming here for this purpose
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to make this a habit.
I want the youth of the country to try to connect themselves with the electoral roll and participate in the vote.
In the election season, I am talking about one thing and the first one is the vote, then everything else.
Everyone has to do this sacred work.
I met a young man studying class VIII, Kshitij Pandey.
Banaras is studying the 7th class at the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Hindu University.
Likewise, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
This 9-year-old girl, who lives in Sundarpur in Varanasi, is the daughter of Sadhavruj Patel.
This is a woman from a very poor family.
But the greatest thing is that when she heard of a voice in the Geetha, she admits it and explains its English explanation and Hindi language.
When I asked her father about this, he told her that she was telling this from her 5th year.
He said this is a wonder for all of us in his family.
This has made me a big impact on you.
Some children have an intimidation with populars, but child Sonamuk has no such involvement.
I only felt that God has given her some special power.
It is a matter of great importance that I met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month, we have to make the voice of your mind once a week because we get a lot of fervor from these.
Sages, don't you know what you want from me to work
Now it is a monthly one.
A year has passed since Mann Ki Baat.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu used the sound
He started the broadcast in Germany, spreading his ideas through radio for the people living in India.
Asad made the beginning of the Hindi radio through a week-long press release.
He broadcast radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Urudhu and Pashtu.
Even me, a year has passed since my radio broadcast through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Your contribution is incapable of paying me.
My best wishes to you all again.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
Once again I have got a good opportunity to inform you about the voice of my heart.
People are celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan in the southern part of the country and yesterday the festival of Raksha Bandhan was celebrated throughout the country.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security in view of the welfare of the people.
It gives me great pleasure that in a very short time, all of you have joined hands in these projects in a wider way.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had made a small request to our sisters to bring the benefits of these security schemes.
I have been told that about 11 crore families have been connecting themselves with this scheme in a short time after the launch of the scheme.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are mothers and sisters.
I consider this as a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a scheme that cannot be completed in 60 years could be implemented in such a short span of time.
However, it is a matter of great pleasure that all the departments associated with the implementation of this scheme, all the branches of the banks, all the branches of the banks, are engaged in it with full force and mind.
They have saved 22,000 crore rupees, even though it was said that the capital account could be started.
One of the major incentives of the economy is the banking sector, which has reached the homes of the poor.
Today 1.
25 lakh bank comrades are working on the ground.
This has provided employment to the youth.
Now thousands of people have been empowered to take overdraft because of this Jan Dhan Yojana.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again I convey my best wishes and felicitations to all those associated with it and I appeal to all the poor that you should not break your relationship with the banks at any time.
Banks are yours, don't leave you in any way.
We have brought the banks to the doorsteps of your homes, don't leave them alone, hold fast.
All of us should have cash in their bank accounts.
I have unbelievable belief that you will definitely do this.
Over the past few days, the incidents in Gujarat have caused violence and the entire country to lose peace, this is a natural feeling.
This kind of incident has happened on the soil of the birth of Gandhi and Sardar, which causes deep sorrow and pain to all the people of the country.
Peace, unity and brotherhood - this is the right path
On the path of progress, all of us should move shoulder to shoulder with shoulders.
Progress can only be solved for all our problems.
The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, has visited Buddhist Gaya.
I am proud to participate in this programme of Buddhist certifications from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I want to share my heart with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers and I have been saying this several times.
My farmer brothers and sisters, don't be afraid of my farmers.
I assure you that if anyone seeks to guide you on the wrong path in order to make you nervous, we will not take any action in order to replace it.
For us, every citizen of the country has a value, but the ideas and voices of the farmers have a unique significance.
We brought an emergency law.
The deadline for the Emergency Act will be concluded on 31st August, 2018.
This will ensure that the farmers do not have any economic losses.
For us, the words Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not mere words but a mantra.
The interests of the poor farmers in the villages are in our hearts.
Therefore, I had mentioned in my Independence Day speech that the Ministry should not only act as a agriculture sector but also as a Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department.
We are taking this resolution forward at a fast pace.
I want to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965 and completed 50 years.
When we talk about the war in 1965, it is natural to remember Lal Bahadur Sastri.
Similarly, we will also remember the mantra of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan.
Our scientists are truly making significant progress.
I have been given several new information.
This is encouraging and educating for me.
Many young scientists have shared things with me with a lot of vision and I have dreamed many things in their eyes.
Even in the voice of last Mann Ki Baat, I had said that we should guide our student wealth to science.
I had also spoken on the occasion of my Independence Day speech on what is the need for a positive selection in the lower levels.
When there is an appeal, every poor family and widowed mothers have to face issues related to obtaining a compassionate letter, seeking the help of someone who gets a job.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption at the bottom.
I had said that there should not be a positive choice under certain circumstances.
I am glad that the government has been making rapid strides in this direction, the suggestions are being made, the resolution will be almost complete and the system of honest selection for lower level posts will be tampered with.
In today's days, there have been transnational figures for India.
In order to reduce the maternal mortality rate, 24 countries of the world have organized a conference in India in coordination with the implementation of the Call to Action Plans.
For the first time outside the US, this ideological meeting was held in India.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die after delivery.
We have also been freed from the tetanus, which is the reason for the deaths of mother and child, as we have been released from polio.
It is also accepted by the world.
But even today we have to save our mothers and save our children.
Brothers and sisters, Today, dengue is spreading.
It is true that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is very simple to avoid it.
My request for a clean India is linked to this.
Even if we watch advertising on television, our focus is not on them.
While advertising on the newspapers, our children are not paid in them.
Awareness is being provided to the people in small households and ways to protect clean drinking water.
Nevertheless, we don't care about it, we live in good houses, there are many facilities, but in some cases we don't know about the water surrounding us.
I urge you not to extend your graduates so easily to death.
Life is a very valuable one.
It is not true that the calls for death are the lack of attention to water constraints and the neglect of cleanliness.
About 514 dengue fever detection centres have been set up across the country and free tests have been conducted here.
Examining time and getting treatment is a life-saving thing.
Your cooperation is very important in this regard.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepavali, festivals and festivals will be filled in our country in the coming days.
Why shouldn't we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records will be habitual, right
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a happy message with you.
Hindra Mahajan, Dr.
In the minds of Mahendra Mahajan, the interests of our tribal people have improved.
Both of these brothers have made India proud.
This year, these two brothers have won this philosophy and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and felicitations to these two brothers.
But in all these endeavours, they are concentrating on the interests of ethnic races such as Team India, Vision for Tribals.
Everyone has been contributing to the progress of the country.
When we hear about such events, the chest is proud.
Sometimes, because of our perspective, we bring evil injustice to our young people.
I believe that this trend has been going on for centuries.
But my experience with the young people is different.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can learn a lot of things.
I have met many youngsters who have decided on Sunday to ride a bike.
Some people pursue it as a cycle day that I'll travel in a cycle one day a week.
They say that this gives me joy and joy for my health and well-being and environment.
Nowadays, cycle clubs are operating in many cities of our country and there are many people to encourage cyclone travel.
This is a good effort for health and environmental well-being.
The vision of the youth of the country is also remarkable as the achievement of two youngsters of India has made the country honourable.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial on Mumbai's Hindu Mills land has been dragged for many years.
The memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who is set up by the Maharashtra government, will be celebrated when the Indians visit London around the world.
I also extend my heartfelt congratulations and felicitations to the State Government of Maharashtra, who is trying to create these two memorials that will be honoured by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes and thanks to you all.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor need pulses, and they need a little bit of money to add pulses.
I am glad that this has been done so that pulses grow by 50 percent and oil crops grow by about 33 percent.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to my farmer brothers on this matter.
My dear countrymen, July 26 is the day of victory in the Kargil war in the history of our country.
The Kargil war is not only on the borders, but every village and city of India has contributed to it.
I consider July 26th as a matter of great importance.
After the formation of our government in 2014, within a few months we launched mygov website on 26th July.
As the government has completed nearly a year, nearly 2 crore people have reached mygov website and about 5 12 lakh people have been informed about their views.
More than 50,000 people have given their suggestions on PMO applications and have spent their golden time in this regard and have paid their children to it and are also happy to see this as an important one.
They have given a very extraordinary advice.
But the people in this regard have not yet been taken into consideration, but brothers and sisters, Akhilesh Vajpayee ji had taken the advice of the government and today we have implemented it.
Today, for any scheme of the government, logo and tag lines are being created, projects are being formulated and policies are being formulated.
Nowadays, on 15th August, I have started consultations on my gov address on what I should talk about.
Susitra Charuvacharya from Chennai has given me many suggestions.
He said that we should protect our daughters, keep our daughters educated, talk about Clean Ganga, Clean India.
You can register your views on what I should talk about on 15th August this time.
You can send Mygov to the address, write to the radio and send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
It is a wonderful idea that I should get a place in my speech on 15th August from the public.
I am sure you will give me a wonderful idea.
Two days ago, my child went on an accident in Delhi and after that accident, the life of the person who traveled in Scotter broke for ten minutes.
He did not get any help.
On several occasions, people have been asking me to talk about road safety and create awareness.
It's all right to worry about you.
And if we ignore the statistics, the heart shall cease.
Every minute accident is taking place in our country.
I urge the parents to set up an environment related to the safety of the child, whether it is a 2-lane vehicle or a 4-wheeler, whether it is a safety-related environment.
We are bringing the Road Transport and Protection Bill in mind, keeping in mind all these things, whether it is an engineering related to road safety, implementation of the law, emergency treatment for the injured after the accident.
In the coming days, we are planning to take several important initiatives to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
From Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, on national highways like Mumbai and Ranchi, we have given importance to cashless treatment.
Accordingly, we are contemplating how to achieve greater livelihood and maintenance in the first 50 hours, keeping away the issues relating to whoever is paying, whether it is money or not.
In fact, every living value is primarily that we should approach it with a view to avoiding accidents.
Sometimes I say that the workers should be Karma Yogis.
I share with you some of the events that touched my heart in the past few days.
It is a good feeling to see how everybody can bring life even in their own jobs.
Vijay Biswal has expressed how he can connect his country, his art and his openness with his work.
I believe that Vijay Biswal's picture will be a matter of talk in the days to come.
I am very delighted that a large group of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has been working on this.
Sometimes even a few small things are very happy, so I share them with you.
There is a village named Kashla in Rajnandka, Chhattisgarh
Over the past few months, they have tried to build toilets.
Now no one from that village has to spend its natural resources openly.
Whatever happened, when it was completed, the entire village celebrated it as a big festival.
The best examples of how the values of social life change, how the attitude of the people is changing, how the citizens of the country are taking the country on the path of progress.
Bhavesh Day from Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the Northeast.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a ministry named DONER was formed that means the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern States.
Well, cant we decide the interests of the North-Eastern states by sitting in Delhi or not
Therefore, a team of officials of the Government of India visited the Northeast including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This effort will have good results in the coming days.
This is an effort to move from Delhi to far-flung areas and to say that I am ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the success of the Chevyog Metro Rail Project.
Just a few days ago, India has launched 5 satellites in the UK through its PSLV C28.
This news is not one of the greatest attractions, but it is a great achievement.
Sometimes when we ask the young people of the country what you want after you grow, one of them answers that I want to be the most scientist.
It is a matter of concern that the country is seen less on scientific terms.
With this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has launched a National Innovation Mission.
I request the officers of the government of India to share your experiences with them and it will certainly help them. I want you to spend one or two hours a week in order to encourage the students of your nearest schools and colleges.
Our villages should get 24 hours of electricity or not
This work is difficult, but it must be completed.
Today, even if we have to charge mobile, we have to go to another village.
The benefits available to the cities should also be extended to the villages and these facilities of the poorest of the poor should get the opportunity.
In this context, we have launched the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti.
Our country is the largest country, there are thousands of villages here, we have to ensure electricity supply to the most remote areas.
Your views will be a gift to me.
Thank you
When I said so, I didn't expect such a huge response from you.
Hundreds of people had sent photographs through Twitter, Festival and Instagram.
I also retweet some of them attracted my views.
If some people don't record the photographs of the Andhra Pradesh (B) Palam caves, it wouldn't be known that many people in the country have such caves.
This is the photo of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We know that Rajasthan is always a low water state, but it is very surprising when one sends photographs of Manal waterfalls.
In fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can assure you that Yoga exercises are not covered by the sun in the world.
What kind of red carpet the world has enlarged Yoga, when we look at it, what kind of Indian will respect and pride in mind
And I enjoyed myself in a flood of joy, and my soul was trembled.
While the Sean River and the Eiffel Tower are very proud of the people of France, they have chosen these symbols as a backbone for Yoga training.
The NUYARK people knew the Times Square for Yoga.
While talking about Australia's Sydney, the scenes of Abero Houss are thrilled immediately.
The Australians undertook yoga exercises in front of the Abera House.
Rajpath is Yoga.
A new upsurge, a new spirit, a new zeal and a new zeal in all the crores of the world was felt.
A few days ago, a child from Vietnam had televised a picture of Yoga by her family, which was very fascinating, and is famous all over the world.
Women, men, elderly, children, villagers, city dwellers, developed countries and growing countries were all involved in Yoga training.
Yoga has actually become a factor in connecting the world.
I don't know how the world will embarrass and criticize this event.
But I feel that the world is very enthusiastic about India. It is a matter of pride for every Indian.
An interest in India has increased, the world is keen to know about India's values, traditions and culture.
But if we have the pride and honour of our tradition then we can explain this to the world very well.
Sometimes we think of what is innovation in it, for example, we can tell our family values, and we dont know that India's family values are the biggest thing for the world.
This is the request of the youth of the country, especially the youth of the IT sector. You all should work together on online yoga activities.
Do you know that there is a department called Ayush in the government
Nobody's attention will return to it.
In five years, there will be 2,4 times the news of it, a small sector in a corner.
But it was presided over the Yoga Day.
The smallest sector has shown the world's largest work.
This is an example of how many small organisations can accomplish when the goal is before us.
The world was surprised to see how our people rescued the victims of the country.
Within a few hours, the world saw that Indians rushed to Nepal and extended their help.
If we start working hard on our minds, the government will work faster, the government servants will work faster and the common man will be celebrated with a lift on his head.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power that progresses the country.
Last month we announced three life insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been engaged in life insurance schemes in some way but we have to take this forward.
I want to put an idea in my mind and put it before you.
In August, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is going on and we all will start a strong mass movement before the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Come, let us all work together to fulfil this pledge.
When I shout my heart, many people advise me.
This time several people have suggested to me that I should tell you something about the monsoon season.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Dhandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan of Mysore, Praveen Nadakarni and Divyaanshu Kupta have been asking you to speak in your mind about the weather.
They have given their share of good ideas.
You too may have been enjoying this rainy season along with hot pakora, bajji and solam.
Just as the sun's rays give us life, the rain also gives us strength.
Every drop of rain is valuable.
In the form of a citizen and in the form of a society, we must develop the feeling of protecting every drop of water.
Water in the village should be in the village, as well as the use of the city's water city.
We have to protect every drop of water from vaccination, water supply management, small ponds and lakes.
If you come to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, if you can see his house, you can see that there is a hut inside his 200-year-old house in a stored ground where rain water is available directly.
You must see this.
Even during that period, this amount of interest has been taken.
We can do this too
It must be transformed into a mass movement.
The village should be adopted this way.
Similarly, Greens loot our eyes.
How rich is the life of greenery
All these tree plantations, gardens and parks make life a greenery.
We all have to work in a big way through the medium of social organisations in this rainy season.
I give a suggestion from my own experience and this rural technology is a very successful one.
When you are in the middle of the tree, keep an old soil near the tree, fill it with water.
Health is one of the most important factors for multiplying microorganisms due to moisture in the atmosphere.
Cleanliness is very important.
It is important to drink clean water.
Most people boil water in this season.
There are benefits from this.
The amount of interest we pay is protected from diseases.
There is a need for water and rain, but it is important to be safe from the illness.
Friends, we are now introducing three new projects, particularly for the urban people.
According to the Amrit Yojana, we have created a mission that will make our cities a better place for livelihood.
In 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of its independence, the house of all Indians should be built.
Considering these three things, we have started a big scheme.
This inspired all the fathers to take a selfie photo with their daughters and register them on social networks.
In Haryana, the rate of female children is very low compared to males.
There are 100 districts of this kind of concern in the country.
This is very high in Haryana.
In some way, we will make the scheme of Safety and Learning of Children into a mass movement.
You will be able to see how much happiness the movement will provide for the upliftment of daughters, honour and protection of daughters.
Secret the rainy season
Make our country green
I am saying this in an experience.
Take this forward.
Next time I meet you for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Some of them think that I should announce the welfare schemes of the government in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
It gives me happiness.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this mid-term would have passed.
And it came to pass on Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, that the feeling that something has been left out of me is like this to me and to you
But I thought that what happened at that time - no, it should be a Sunday programme.
But I was eagerly waiting for this Sunday.
Many people have asked me why I travelled to Kedarnath in the midst of the election.
But if I start travelling in that direction, then we can change the course of Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, I have woken up while the polls continued to sympathize with the electoral turmoil and victory.
Many consider it a political implication.
For me, I consider it as an occasion to meet me.
In a way, I'm going to meet me.
I cannot say when I will do it, but I will definitely do it because it is my duty to tell you your right to know.
As the people have expressed their desire to know about the matter of Kedar, I have been consistently recognising your efforts to strengthen positive things.
The inclinations in the letters of Mann Ki Baat are completely different from the customary government.
Sometimes there are your words that open the bed between my thoughts.
When one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against cleanliness and collaborates in the efforts of cleanliness.
If one discusses the environment, it reflects his pain
But he also mentions his efforts and his thoughts in his mind.
In a way, a scene of how the solution to the problems can be contained in the entire society will be brightened in his words.
Mann Ki Baat acts as a glass for the country and society.
This shows that there is no dearth of determination, energy and capabilities in the depths of the countrymen.
It is necessary to coordinate those strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and make positive efforts.
The Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore people of the country want to be strong and constructive in the progress of the country.
One is writing a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but you have imagined that he has not submitted any application for himself...
..and how excellent the feelings of such millions of people of the country will be
When I examine all these things, I leave your imagination as to how much joy I feel, how much enthusiasm is there in me.
You are driving me, you are working me fast, you cannot imagine that you are inserting your life within me every moment...
Without this relationship, I was waiting for delivery.
Today my heart is filled with happiness.
In this spirit, we will take forward the voice of the mind with joy, come forward
When emergency was created in the country, the struggles against it did not stop with political limitations or political leaders
It has not been imprisoned even in the midst of a prison camp.
Every citizen was angry.
There was a cycle for the drastic democracy.
You don't know what is hungry every day when we eat non-food.
Likewise, whenever one comes to know about the joy of giving democracy in a normal life, it is only when one breaks down our democratic rights.
And it came to pass, when the emergency was born, that every citizen throughout the country perceived that something had been broken.
I can immensely proudly say that India is a society that has been working for this legacy.
This is why the people of the country realized the lack of democracy, and we experienced this lack of time.
Therefore the country, not for itself, offered a whole election not for its own sake, but for the protection of democracy.
Anything that is far away from our click, we underestimate its importance, we ignore their miracles.
More than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
This number seems to be very common to us, but if we see China from the perspective of the world, more people have voted in this election than any country in the world.
The number of voters who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total population of the United States than the population of the whole of Europe.
This indicates the vastness and widespread character of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections have so far been the world's largest democratic election.
Just imagine yourselves how great things and wealth shall be required to govern such a great election.
This has been possible as a result of hard work overnight, as many as millions of teachers, officers and staff.
This time, due to their hard work, there has been more voting than last time.
In order to vote, around 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh polling stations, more than 17 lakh web sites...
I leave the greatness of arrangements to your imagination.
All these were implemented to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was established only for one female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the election officers had taken two days to go there.
This is the real respect given to democracy.
The world's highest polling station is located in India itself.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet at the Lahaul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, this election has one more thing to glorify.
This may be the first time in history that even women have been nurtured to vote with enthusiasm for men.
In this election, the voting rate of women and men was almost equal.
Another encouraging thing about this is that today the number of women members in the House is 78.
My dear countrymen, you might have heard several times that it is not a bouquet but a bouquet.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers at times like receptions and honour.
Since then, people have started delivering books at many places.
Now someone has given me a book titled 'Premchand ji's famous stories.
It has not been time for many days, but due to foreign travel, some of his stories have been re-educated.
Bremsand has described the reality of the society in his stories and when he reads, those scenes start immigrating in your mind artistically.
Every thing he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
In the second episode, I touched the depths of my mind, its name is Eidgah.
And understanding of the grace of a child, and his love of the purity of his shoe, and his heart in such a small age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his granddaughter by buying a basket of bread from the festival, indeed, the human emotion is spreading.
Likewise, a book titled 'Poos Kee Rath'.
A contradiction in the life of a poor farmer has been portrayed alive in this story.
Even after the destruction of his crop, why is the farmer Haldu happy because he does not need to sleep in his field in the bone-growing cold
But even though these stories were written about a century ago, we can feel that they are so suitable today.
After reading these things, I realized a unique experience.
While talking about the study, I was reading in some media about the Akshara library in Kerala.
Once upon a time, they have tied the books into bundles and put them on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new direction not only to the children of tribals but also to all.
Gujarat's Wanje Gujarat campaign is a successful effort.
All the elderly people participated in this book-reading movement.
I would like to urge you to spend some time in the digital world, in the Kurukshetra period, to provide a place to the books through your daily routine.
In fact, you will be very fond of this and write about the book you have read and in the NarendraModi App so that the voices of the mind can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to learn that our countrymen are also thinking about the challenges that can emerge in the future.
When I read these comments in the NarendraModi App and MyGov, I was able to observe that many people wrote about water.
Apart from Pawan Gaurai of Pelkavi and Siddamsu Mohan Paridha from Bhubaneswar, many others like Yash Sharma and Shahab al-Daf have written about water related challenges.
Water has a great significance in our culture.
It is said about the water in Rickweed's accident - Apohishta Mayobuva: The Kingdom of Kayts, Maharanaya Chakshe, Yova: Siddhamoras: Dasya Bajaydehna, Ushatriva Matra, i. e.
Your mother is equal to mother i.e. motherhood will enjoy her blessings and enjoy her compassion.
Water conservation has affected many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water received due to rain can be stored in our country throughout the year.
It's just 8 percent.
That's why the time to find a solution to this problem has come down.
I am confident that if we open 130 crore countrymen with the help of peoples participation, with the help of peoples power, with the help of 130 crore countrymen, with the help of satisfaction, this distress can be solved.
Considering the importance of water, a new Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country.
This will ensure speedy decision-making of all water related matters.
Just a few days ago, I was supposed to separate certain things.
I drafted a letter to the heads of the Panchayats of the country and the heads of the village.
And I wrote to them, saying, To save water, to collect water, to preserve every drop of rain water, they should join the Gram Sabha and join the villagers in black consultation.
I am very happy that they have been involved in this work and on 22nd of this month crores of people participated in thousands of panchayats.
Every villager had a determination to save every drop of water and shared their physical work.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about a banquet leader.
The people there were once again ready to contribute their positive role for water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the rural leaders who have worked positively from my side.
There are several leaders who have made such a challenge of water conservation across the country.
In a way, this is an opportunity for the entire village.
There is a feeling that the villagers will engage in the competition to build a temple for some water in their village.
As I have said, positive results are available through social initiatives.
There is no single way to confront water constraints all over the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country and in different ways.
But the goal of all is to save water and maintain water.
Pandian sewerage systems are being improved.
This effort will liberate from the problem of blockade.
There is a change in the lives of the villagers due to the water logging in Telangana's Thimmaiyapalli.
There has been a major change in Kabirdham in Rajasthan due to the small ponds in the fields.
When I was studying about a social effort in Vellore in Tamil Nadu, I knew that there were 20000 women mobilizing the revival work of the Naga river.
At the same time, I also read about the women of the Khatwal region, who have worked very well with each other for collecting rain water.
When people gather, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I make three appeals to the people of the country.
My first appeal - just as the countrymen have transformed cleanliness into a mass movement, let us take the initiative to transform water conservation into a mass movement.
I am confident that you are Gods gift, that is a marvellous jewellery, and that is a wonderful jewel.
It was said that this rasamani bath would be iron.
But you too are such a rasamani that new life is being produced due to the sprinkling of water.
We have to create a massive awareness campaign to save every drop of water.
Several traditional methods of water conservation have been used in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods with you all.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to the original place in Porbandar, then there is a 200-year-old water conservation in a house behind the mother's house.
Come, let us create a comprehensive list of water conservation and encourage people to engage in water conservation.
You all share your ideas using JanShakti4JalShakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you and the people of the world for one more thing.
The Presidents of many countries of the world, the Prime Ministers, the prominent and the common citizens of the world, showed me through the Diversion that how Yoga is being done in every country.
On that day, the world showed itself as a happy family.
We know that there is a need for a healthy society, healthy and understanding individuals.
Therefore, the spread of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Shouldn't we honour this kind of service as a recognition
In the year 2019, the announcement of the Prime Minister's Awards for the outstanding contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga has given me an unprecedented momentum.
This award is conferred on institutions that have contributed significantly to the spread of Yoga throughout the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan conducts various institutions and training courses there
Likewise, Ms.
He is an example of hypocrisy.
When it comes to Yoga related matters, tell us whether India is backward
Yoga must be celebrated widely and Yoga must be honoured for those who bring the message of Yoga to all homes.
My dear countrymen, this journey has begun today.
Yes, wait for your suggestions and views as always.
We will meet again and again and again.
I listen to your feelings, collect and understand.
Sometimes I try to live with those feelings.
Let your blessings continue.
You are my thoughts, you are myself powerful.
Come together, let us enjoy the voice of the mind, let us fulfill our obligations in life on Tuesday.
Once again we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Many thanks to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is conscious of the beginning of Mann Ki Baat.
10 days ago, Mother India has lost her brave sons.
These brave soldiers have lost their lives to save 125 crore countrymen.
Our brave sons had dedicated themselves in the night without me, so that the countrymen could sleep in peace.
The hearts of the countrymen are wounded and boiling in anger after the martyrdom of our soldiers in Pulwama's terrorist attack.
There have been condolences from all sides about the martyrs and their families.
I bow down to the heroes of the land, who sacrifice their lives, to save Mother India.
The task of confronting this challenge before the nation must be forgotten by all the differences between casteism, religiousism and regionalism, when our endeavours and decisions against extremism will be determined, tough and tough.
Our armed forces have always been showering sufficient sufficient sustenance and might.
On the one hand, while expressing their excellent talent to maintain peace, they have done the same language that understands the attackers.
You can see how the operations were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
The military is determined to root out the extremists and their subsidiaries.
After the survival of the brave soldiers, the words and ideas expressed by their relatives through the media have been widespread and have strengthened the mindset throughout the country.
Meena, wife of Martyr Prasanna Sahu, from Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, celebrates her unbounded passion all over the country.
He acknowledged that he would join his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shorena's plague reached Kumla in Jharkhand when he was martyred by the Tricolor flag, his fianc son warned that I would also work with the army.
The greed of this fibre is that today every child of India has a mixed spirit within the body and within the body.
It is the story of every family of the martyrs of Balakanat, the six-year-old brother of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the son of Dilakraj, the martyr of Kangda or the martyr of Hemraj of Koda.
I urge the young people to know, understand and understand what these families have expressed, what they have set a target.
In order to know what is patriotism, what is sacrifice, we do not have to pursue the past layers of history.
My dear countrymen...
For so long as we were all waiting for a memorial of war, that time of wait is to be fulfilled.
In this regard, the greed and enthusiasm of the countrymen is a natural thing.
Shri Onkar Shetty of Karnataka's lap in the NarendraModiApp has expressed his happiness over the creation of a National War Memorial.
It is surprising and sad that no national level war memorial has been established in our country so far.
I want this to be a memorial decorated with the legends of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I am sure that such a monument must be established in the country.
The second wheel, the cycle of valour, reveals the cycle of the soldiers, and the cycle of the soldiers.
The heroic acts of the soldiers would have been trampled on the walls of this venue.
Subsequently, the Martyr Chakra
This chakra indicates the martyrdom of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who gave the nation a solemn pledge would have been engraved in the manuscripts.
After this, the Rakshak Chakra symbolizes security.
There is a queue of dense trees in this chakra.
It is impossible to utter the enormous contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in order to improve the country.
In October last year, I got the opportunity to offer the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial was also created as a reflection of the feeling that we should be grateful to the men and women of our police who are engaged in security all the time.
I am confident that you will definitely visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go to those places, you must share the photographs you have taken there on the social network so that the others get inspired to visit these holy places.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and comments have come to me in different ways for Mann Ki Baat.
This time when I was reading your comments, in which an interesting idea of AshweshMukobadhyay ji attracted my attention.
His age was only 25 when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, on the 3rd of March, Jamsetji Tata ji's birthday is also a coincidence.
He added that both of these men belong to the entirely diverse family backgrounds, but both of them fulfil the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
Giving chariots to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is in a way equivalent to celebrating the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great men are not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the entire country.
The whole country is grateful for their contribution.
An inspirational person is required today for the guidance of our youth, he is Lord Birsa Munda.
And when he was asleep, the British took him while he slept with trembling and sorrow.
Do you know why they have kept such an evil thing
Because even the British who had established such a great empire were afraid of him.
Lord Birsa Munda, with the help of arrows in his traditional villain, supplied the British regime to use gunfire.
In fact, if there is a leadership that envisages people, the social tension is greater than the forces of arms.
The deceitful, the deceitful, the deceitful, took them to the sun, which was shining from darkness.
Lord Birsa Munda was martyred at the end of his 25 years of life.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India have appeared in all parts of the land.
Such great men were filled everywhere that India could not be seen anywhere as a part of the freedom struggle that had taken place for centuries.
But it is unfortunate that the stories of their sacrifice, sacrifice and sacrifice do not go to the new generations.
If people like Lord Birsa Munda have realized our existence then people like Jamsetji Tata have given great institutions to the nation.
In the right way, Jamsetji Tata ji was a visionary prophet who had not only seen the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He was very well aware that it would be a future requirement for India to be made an architect of science, technology and industry.
It is because of his vision that the Tata Institute of Science has been established and now it is known as Indian Institute of Science.
Moreover, he established many reliable companies and industries like Tata Steel.
As a result of this conversation, Indian Institute of Science was born.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of our country's former Prime Minister Morarji Bhai Patel on 29th February.
You all know that this day will come only once in four years.
Accordingly, a peaceful person, Morarji Bai, is one of the most regulated leaders of the country.
Morarji Bhai Patriot, who has dedicated the highest budget report in the Parliament of India.
During that period, the country's democratic system was in great danger, when Morarji Bai Desh ji led India in a very difficult time.
Morarji Bai Patriya dedicated himself against the urgency to defend democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his office.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janatha Party won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his regime, the 44th constitutional amendment was passed.
If this is very important, the 42nd Constitutional Amendment was introduced to create an emergency, in addition to reducing the powers of the Supreme Court, some of the difficulties in it have broken down our democratic values, so they were withdrawn.
This means that through the 44th Constitutional Amendment, the functioning of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies was empowered to print in newspapers.
For the first time, the President was able to proclaim the state of emergency only on the recommendation of the Cabinet in writing, and the period of emergency cannot exceed a period of six months.
In this way, Morarji Bai ji pledged to prevent the resumption of the state of emergency and the assassination of democracy in 1975.
His contribution to the preservation of Indian democracy is immense, and now generations will remember it.
And once again, I pray thee, to a great prince of this kindness, and to my praises.
They have made a positive change in the lives of others in different ways with the help of their hard work.
And as they are, they are real workers: they are the people, and the society, and they do the service of the country more than all of them in their own right.
When Padma Awards are announced, you might have seen the people asking who is the awardee.
In a way, I consider this as a great success because they will not be found in television and newspaper cards and they will be away from the lucky world.
However, if these people are not concerned about their name, they are confident of working on the ground.
And they lived by the sword of Carmasus Gaushal.
I would like to share with you some of these things.
You might be aware of Odisha's brave Nayak, but it is not because of his calling him the canal man of Odisha, who had slaughtered the mountain by his hands in his village and built a three kilometres long road.
I saluted the former President of the United States, Barak Obama, for the Tree of Life painting created by Abdul Kafur.

This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
My dear countrymen, exams are going to start in schools.
In the next few weeks, various Boards of Education across the country will start the Board Selections for Class 10 and Twelve.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to write the exams.
A few days ago, a major event in the Down Hall was held in Delhi, called the Pariksha Pe Charcha, which is the Speech on Elections.
One of the highlights of the interaction on exams is that discussions are being held without any restriction on various issues related to exams.
Because we have thousands of years of ancient culture and tradition.
A few days later, the holy day of Mahasivaratri is coming, this time, when Sivaratri is coming on Monday, a special significance spreads the colourful sand in our hearts.

When I was speaking, a young man with an eye-catched talent said he was an alphabet, and when he introduced himself as a microscope in the casual events, I asked him who would speak like you.
He said I would like to talk to the Prime Minister and do Mimikri.
I was just waiting for a surprising surprise when I was just doing a little bit, just as I spoke in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, he made the voice of Mann Ki Baat through Mikri.
I am glad to know that people not only listen to Mann Ki Baat but also remember it on several occasions.
In fact, I was very disappointed to see the power of this changing youth and they had a big impact on me.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through Mann Ki Baat has given me an impossible experience.
I am interacting with crores of families in a way through radio every month.
It is in my mind that you consider me as your family member, when you speak with you many times, when you read the letters and hear your phone calls.
This feeling enhances a comfortable experience in my mind , is comfortable .
Friends, Elections are the biggest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, all of us will be drowned in the electoral process.

That is, on March-April, with the strength of your blessings, with all my feelings of these three months after the elections, with the strength of your blessings, I will once again start our conversation through Mann Ki Baat and I will travel together for several years with the voice of your mind.
Once again I thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Sivakumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumaraswamy is about to follow this philosophy.
He served for the social, education and economic development of thousands of people in his 111-year career.
If his panditism was so widespread, he had a wonderful insight into English, Samskrit and Kannada.
He is a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in dieting, sheltering, education, and spiritual wisdom.
The main objective of Swami ji's life was to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
Siddhaganga Math has been organising a uniform process of cultivation and cultivation.
I have had many times to get the blessings of Swami ji.
Our former President Dr. A.
During this period, Kamala Sai read a poem written for Vanakakacharya Swamiji.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Sayeed describes the life of Sri Sri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji and the aim of Siddhaganga Math.
There is a very important institution in our country
This is the combination of our democracy and our democracy - I speak of the Election Commission of India.
On the 25th of January, the foundation day of the Election Commission, we celebrate this on the National Voters Day.
In view of the scale of elections held in India, the world puts a stir on the noses of surprise
Polling stations are being set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15000 feet and also in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In the Kir forest area, only one polling station has been set up for one voter at a far-flung location.
Imagine, guys...
The entire team of Election Commissioners is going to the far-flung areas to get the opportunity to use the voter's voter's vote in mind.
I sincerely appreciate the Election Commission which continues to strive to strengthen the democratic system.
I compliment the Election Commissions of all the States, all the Defence Forces and other defence personnel who are free and discriminatory in the election work.
Lok Sabha elections are going to take place this year in our country
Young people born in the 21st century are going to vote for the first time in the elections.
And they shall have the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the land in their shoulders.
Now they are going to be partners in the process of making resolutions for the country.
When we connect our dreams with the dreams of the nation then it has become fruitful.
If you are eligible to vote, I urge you to register your name on the electoral roll.
If we are not able to vote for some reason in life then we should feel that it is sad for us.
If we say that something wrong has happened in the country then we should feel sad.
This process has to be transformed naturally.
I urge all of us to join hands with the voters and vote on the day of polls that this time we should run a movement and create awareness.
I am confident that younger generations will register their names in large numbers and will make their contribution better for our democracy and further strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, many times great men have emerged on this great land of India, such great men have been doing some marvellous and unforgettable things for the human society.
On 23rd January, he celebrated his birth anniversary in a new way.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I got a great opportunity to inaugurate the museum dedicated exclusively to the beneficiaries of the contribution in the freedom struggle of the country.
Inside the Red Fort, several such rooms and memorials have been closed since independence.
The closing Red Fort rooms have been converted into museums dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
The Museum, built in the memory of Indias first freedom struggle, is dedicated to the entire campus as the Kranti Mandir, the Kranti Mandir.
The aroma of our glorious history resides in every brick of these museums.
In this case, the British government has prosecuted the brave sons of Bharat Mata, Colonel Frame Cycle, Colonel Kurbaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
When I was listening to the memories associated with Netaji in the Revolutionary Temple of the Red Fort, one of Netaji's family gifted me a very special gift.
In fact, our new generations need to bring the bravery and patriotism of our heroes again and again in different dimensions.
About a month ago, on December 30, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has given me the opportunity to fly the Triple Talaq at any place 75 years ago.
On this occasion, the announcement of the Azad Hind Government came up 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and capable administrator.
Such a brave soldier has played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Dilli Salo, you give me momentum and I give you freedom. With the slogans of awakening and inspiration, Netaji will fulfil the wishes of every Indian.
For many years, there was a demand for secret letters of him to be brought to public
I am extremely happy that we are working on this task.
I don't think that all the family members of Netaji came to my house for a day.
Together we talked about many things related to Netaji, we censored our paintings to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to improve many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
It will be 26, Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum and Grand Candidate associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to share with you an event related to Netaji's life in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I have always considered radio as an important media for connecting people
I have been told that this radio station was broadcast once a week, which was broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urdu.
In this radio management, M.
R.
Vyas ji's contribution is very significant.
The programmes broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very fond of the common people, whose events gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A museum has been built in this revolutionary temple.
Efforts have been made to describe Indian art and culture in a more attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, where there are more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old.
In the museum, excellent works of great artists like Amruta Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Anindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandal Bose, Jamini Rai and Silos Mukherjee have been displayed.
I especially urge you all to go there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
You can imagine that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is talking about art and art, but you are talking about the great works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You all knew Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev is an artist too.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to his majority works.
He thought that the person who sees the image should understand it himself, and that he should look at the news given by the image.
His paintings have been displayed in Europe, in Russia, in the US.
I am confident that you will definitely visit the Grand Candidate and see his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is a land full of saints.
Our pilgrims have conveyed their messages of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such saint is Chand Ravidas.
Ravidas ji was born on February 19th.
Indeed, if God is lying in all human beings, it is not fit to distinguish him from caste, religion and creed.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Pilgrim Ravidas, through his messages, tried to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire life.
If he tells the world the true meaning of the greatness of labour, it will not be exaggerated.
I once again remember the holy Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, in MyGov, Kiren Siddhar ji has been urging us to talk about the Indian space sector and its future related dimensions.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed immensely to Indias space programme.
Our space programme contains the contribution of innumerable young scientists of the country.
It is a matter of our heartfelt consciousness that satellites and soundingrockets developed by our students are reaching out to space.
On the 24th of January this year, the Kalamsat, designed by our students, was launched.
Even the sounding rockets created by university students in Odisha have also been praised.
All the space missions carried out from the country's independence to 2014 have been carried out in the last four and half years.
We have achieved 104 satellites in the same space space space.
We will soon register India's presence in Chandrayaan-2.
Our country has been using space technology in a very important way to safeguard life-styles.
Space technology has been making considerable contribution in the field of climate, rail and road safety.
NAVIC equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which protects them and helps in economic development.
We have been using space technology in a better way to provide government service and accountability.
According to the Housing Scheme for All, about 40 lakh households in 23 states have been provided geo-take.
Besides, geo-tagged assets worth nearly three crore have been made under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
Our satellites are the symbols of the growing power of the country today.
It is because of its contribution that we have made excellent links with many countries of the world.
There is an exclusive effort in South Asia satellites, which has given a glimpse of development to our neighbouring countries.
India is not only the developing countries but also the satellites of the developed countries through its vital competitive mobility services.
The heavens and legends have always been things that attract children.
Our space programme provides opportunities and opportunities to think big and see what is impossible till now.
Our children are attracted by music and inspires them to seek new stars and gives them a vision.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that whoever plays, they grow, they blossom, and this time the sportspersons gathered in Gelo India have brightened.
In January, about 6000 sportspersons participated in 18 games for Khelo India Youth in Pune.
If the sportsperson at the local level works well, he will be able to achieve the best in the world.
The sportspersons from all the States have shown their talent this time in Khelo India.
He lives in a car with his family.
Like her, Sonali Helvey, Captain of Maharashtra's Kabduk group for 21-year-old women lives in Sadar.
He has lost his father at an early age, and his brother and his mother have inspired and encouraged Sonali.
We see in many ways that women don't get much encouragement in sports like kutch.
But Sonali chose the sword beyond all these, and acted very well.
Abhinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Associate, is proud to have won gold medals at a very young age in sports for young Indians.
Akshata Vaswani Kandi, daughter of a farmer in Karnataka, has won a gold medal in the weightlifting sector.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But did you hear about the competition to lit the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
The name of this unique contest is a clean and beautiful toilet.
People used to beautify their toilets and used some paintings, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, a lot of photographs related to clean toilets are available on social networks.
I urge all the Panchayat leaders and village leaders to take leadership in this kind of movement in your Panchayat.
Make sure you share the picture of your clean toilet with MyIzzatGhar on the social network.
Friends, together with the aim of liberating the country from the habit of cleaning and open defecation, we had a memorable journey on 2nd October 2014.
Today, due to the collaboration of the people of India, today, before the 2nd of October 2019, we are moving towards the direction of getting rid of the habit of toilets in the open, which is why we can dedicate to him on the 150th birth anniversary of the farm.
In this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat, the contribution of Mann Ki Baat is immense and for this I am happy to share this thing with you that more than five and a half lakh villages and 600 districts have declared that they have been free from the habit of open defecation.
My young friends, the days of election are getting closer.
Anshool Sharma MyGov, who lives in Himachal Pradesh, has asked me to talk about exams and exam warriors.
And I thank you, O you blessed, for this thing.
Yes, the first part of the year is for many families.
Students, their parents, teachers and teachers are all involved in the work related to exams.
Moreover, students from many foreign countries are also participating in this programme.
I am talking about all the angles associated with the exams in this Pariksha Pe Charcha, particularly with our young friends about unhealthy choices.
I have been asking many people to send inputs and comments for this.
I am happy that a large number of people have shared their views in MyGov.
Some of these ideas and suggestions will definitely be presented during the Down Hall programme.
You must participate in this program...
You can also see its direct telecast through social media and our app.
Let us move ahead successfully in 2019.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
That is when we get the benefits of experience and the self-confidence of taking a new one.
Our ideas are to not only bring about a change in our lives but also to contribute to taking the country and society forward.
This will be a tribute to all of us.

This time, India has won medals in the Asian Games.
India has done a very good job in Para Asian Games.

All these have been fruitful by the constant efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
Jayachandran joined Goddess.
People say that he was keen to treat patients anytime.
Likewise, Sulkitti Narasamma from Karnataka also joined Goddess on 25th December.
Sulakitti Narasama was a helper in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, particularly in remote areas.
At the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padma Shri.
When we talk about healthcare, I also want to talk about the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
A few days back, some members of our party told me that some young doctors camped in the city and provided free treatment to the poor.
Every month many poor patients are benefiting from this camp.
The enthusiasm of these physician friends, who are engaged in selfless service, is truly commendable.
Today, I want to express my pride here that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful movement because of social efforts.
A few days ago, some people told me that in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people have joined the Swachh Bharat Mission at the same time.
People from all walks of life participated in this Swachhata Mahotsav with fervour and enthusiasm from all walks of life like municipal, volunteer organisations, school-collear students and people from Jabalpur.
The success stories of innovative youth and entrepreneurs have been described in a positive way.
Well, will we do a job
Shall we share information on such websites
We all have a positive spirit.
With this, a large number of people will know about our heroes that make changes in society.
There is a great significance for sports in all societies.
When playing, power fills the hearts of those who see it.
We feel a lot of things like sportspersons name, identity and respect for them.
But, in some cases, there are many things behind them and bigger things than the sports world.
I want to tell you about Hanaya Nizar, a young girl from Kashmir who has won a gold medal in the Karate competition in Korea.
Hanaya is a 12-year-old girl from Anantnag area of Kashmir.
He was trained by Karate because of his hard work and endeavour.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I wish that his future be bright.
Many good wishes and good wishes to Hanaya.
Like him, there have been a lot of news in the media about Rajani, another 16-year-old girl, and you must have read.
Rajani has won gold medals in the junior category for women.
After winning the medal, Rajani immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajani rolled his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yes, you all wonder why Rajani drank a cup of milk, right
He did this to pay homage to his father Jasmer Singh, who is selling luxury at a shop in Panib.
Rajani later said that his father had committed a lot of sacrifice to achieve this situation and had suffered many difficulties.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
Kulkarni, a 20-year-old young girl from Pune this year, became the first Asian woman to gain rapid strength in the world in Cycles.
He traveled 159 days a day at a rate of about 300 km per day.
His indecisive interest in paying a bike is really commendable.
When we hear such achievements and such successes, dont we ponder
The names of all these festivals may be different, but there is a feeling of celebrating everything, these festivals are somehow connected with harvest and potatoes, with the farmers, with the villages and with the crops.
At this time it is time to enter the sunrise and the sunset.
After that gradually it starts to grow day by day and starts harvesting cold crops.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of the feeling of unity in diversity - One India is spreading through our festivals.
We can see how close our festivals and festivals are with nature.
Many of our festivals have been specially created in the spirit of rivers and water conservation.
On the day of Saturday, the rivers and waterfalls are sun-charged.
During the Maharash Shankaranti, hundreds of thousands of people have sanctified the rivers.
During these festivals share your photographs with everyone so that everyone can enjoy the diversity of India and the beauty of its culture.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela has a great diversity, however divine it is, it is full of glory.
People from all over the world come and join the Kumbh Mela.
People come to Kumbh with belief and chariot.
Millions of people from the country's neighbourhood join one another.
The tradition of Kumbh is enjoyable in our great cultural tree.
This time, the world famous Kumbh Mela to be organised in Prayagraj starting on 15th January is waiting for you all.
Devotees and saints started coming to Kumbh.
Last year, we can calculate its special significance from the UNESCO organisation linking the Kumbh Mela to the INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF HUMANITY, the absurd cultural heritage of humanity.
A few days ago, the ambassadors of several countries went to see the preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
At the same time, flags of several countries were flew away.
There is a possibility that people from more than 150 countries can participate in this Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj.
With the divinity of the Kumbh, the greatness of India shall fulfil his glory in the world hall.
The Kumbh Mela, a great instrument of self-confidence, has different experiences for every person who comes here, who sees and understands the worldly things with a spiritual vision.
In particular, it gives the youth the opportunity to enjoy this great learning experience.
I had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago and I could see that arrangements for Kumbh are being done very commendably.
The people of Prayagraj are very enthusiastic for Kumbh.
There I dedicated the Integrated Command Control Center, Integrated Command and Control Centre to the people.
This will also reach the far flung areas of cleanliness along with difficulties in the arrangements.
This time, after the sacred bath at the Bhagwan Sangam, the sacred vision of Akshayvad will also be done.
This magnificent episode of the faith of the people was held in the fort for thousands of years so that even if the devotees wanted it could not be seen.
Now the doors of Akshayavat have been opened for all.
May this spiritual pillar be the glory of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of trust be the glory of the nation.
May this Kumbh of the devotees become the pride of world tourism.
Babu had an uncompromising connection with South Africa.
It is in South Africa that Mohn and Mahathma became.
In South Africa, Gandhiji started his first Satyagraha and made a resolution against colorlessness.
He established Finnics and Dalsty farms, from where the voices of peace and justice across the globe began to shout.
He had the patience and inspiration to spend many years in prison.
What do you know about Mandela ji's brother's brother-in-law, "It was here that the world was an integral part of our history.
Here he made clear his commitment to justice
Here he shunned the path of his Satyagraha philosophy and struggle.
He set up his brother as his model.
Friends, Mandela is a symbol of inspiration for the world and their aspirations will always inspire us to build a society of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a conclave of Police Chief Directors at the Narmada coast of Gujarat where economist discussions were held with the top police officers of the country.
There were detailed discussions on how efforts should be made to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He was also involved in maintaining the unity of India.

With this award, we will be able to pay our homage to Sardar Patel Ji.
My dear countrymen, on the 13th of January, Guru Gobind Singh jis holy birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
Until a large part of his life, his work was in North India, and he was sovereign in the land of Maharashtra.
Birth place Patna, functions, North India, the last moments of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India has got his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh got the courage to fight for justice from Sikh Gurus.
But whenever efforts were made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, injustice was done to them, then Guru Gobind Singh ji shouted for the poor and the weak, he fought with his shoulders firmly, hence he says: "Sawa Lake Ek Ladagam, CIDION Son Main Baz Dudagam, and then Gobind Singh Nam Kahagam.
He said, "Fighting with the weak cannot express their strength.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji considered it a great service to wipe out the sorrows of human society.
He was a gentleman of valour, heroism, sacrifice and guidance.
Apart from this, Gurumukhi, Prajabasha, Samskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urudhu were experts in many languages.
I once again convey my best wishes to Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, many events are taking place in the country that have not been discussed much.
FSSAI's a different attempt.
Events are being organized across the country on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Healthy India pillars are being undertaken through Eat Right India Mission, Make in India.
When India becomes clean and healthy then it is self-reliant.
The most important need for good health is nutritious diet.
Knowledge of the importance of food is essential from childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the culmination of the year 2018, we will reunite ourselves in the year 2019 and re-interpret ourselves.
The spirit of individual life, the life of the nation and the life of the society is the source of development.

Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October, 2014, on the occasion of Vijayadasami, we all travelled together through Mann Ki Baat.
The letters and telephone calls from you this time are mostly related to this 50th part.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Delhi, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from Narendra Modi App, Brahminjit Sarkar from Burdwan in West Bengal and Sangeeta Sastri from Nagpur have raised the same question.
Your interest is natural.
In today's era, when the radio was almost forgotten, why is Modi connected by radio
I want to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was working as the Bharatiya Janata Party in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in May.
Take one of the lamps placed in his cannon cup and feed him first before he gets tea.
I was surprised to know why, what happened in the house and someone else was married.
No brother, you don't know
I'm sorry to make it.
Behold, let us hear the radio first.
He was talking about it on the radio.
In this forest, in such an unpopular area, within the snowy mountains, an equivalent man sells tea himself and asks for radio throughout the day.
Therefore, I am not surprising when I turned my attention to the most powerful media radio.
The spirit of Mann Ki Baat has been inspired by the urge to take the farmers to the young professionals from far-flung villages to cities.
Millions of letters were read every month, telephone calls were heard, comments were made in App and MyGov
The journey of these 50 regions, which have been connected with all these things in a single fashion, has been accomplished in an interesting manner.
At present, Indian Radio has conducted a study on Mann Ki Baat.
Some of the settlements are very interesting.
70 of those who have been analyzed are constantly calling for Mann Ki Baat.
They consider the positive spirit of the society as a greater contributor to the voice of the mind.
Peoples movements have been encouraged in a big way through Mann Ki Baat.
There is widespread discussion about Indipositive.
All these underscore the positive and positive feeling of the minds of our countrymen.
People share their feelings that the spirit of self-confidence has increased in the voice of the mind.
It is a big change in the minds of the people that the idea of engaging in social service.
But the people didn't just connect with this programme through voice.
Besides television, FM, mobile, internet, Facebook, Broadcasting, Beriscope, NarendraModi app, people are contributing to Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the responsibilities of the Mann Ki Baat, to believe in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Your doubts are correct.
At the end of their survey, it was also a decision that this event was not politically pro-political.
When Mann Ki Baat started, I had decided that Modi should not be seen anywhere in it.
Letters, Internet comments and telephone calls before every voice were clearly visible.
Modi will come and go, but this country will continue forever, and our culture will not be destroyed by the time.
The short stories of 130 crore countrymen are no longer hidden.
I read the letter, if the same information had been published in another letter, I would also suggest it.
I also share my experience with you.
No government has the power to spread so much widespread and awakening from a small village in Haryana and spread across the country and abroad.
When every section of the society and the protagonists join in a new dimension of change in the society, today's generation understands this, there is an unknowing awareness.
India's eternal social justice is about social power.
There are thousands of angles of social life, one of them is political.
This is not a good system for a healthy society, if politics becomes all.
Sometimes, if political events and politicians dominate, different capabilities and other efforts of the society are suppressed.
Thanks for your phone call.
In a way, you have been asked because of your acceptance.
I have to answer the question that you have asked directly that I don't engage in any of the preparations.
In fact, the voice of mind is a very easy job for me.
People's letters are coming in front of every man's voice.
That letter is not just a paper for me
Indeed, for nearly 40-45 years, I have lived a sacred life and have visited most of the places of the country and have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
To tell the truth, it is my voice in the voice of the mind, but the examples, feelings and feelings are all of my countrymen.
I have not been able to summon the immigrants of lakhs of such people till today, but they are sending their letters and their comments without any disappointment.
I have full confidence that your ideas will contribute more to me than ever before, to make the mindset more comfortable and more frightening.
Efforts are being made to make the concerned department regarding the letters and comments that have not been made in the voice of the mind.
I would like to express my gratitude to all my friends from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other television and social infrastructure.
In that way, they are transforming into Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude and gratitude to all of them.
And I appeal to all of you that you must listen to this event in your state languages.
Any politicalist will never be happy with the media, but it is only a very low coverage, and it is also negative.
But the media has made themselves aware of the varieties raised in Mann Ki Baat.
The media has carried out a number of things like cleanliness, road safety, non-vegetarian India and a cell phone with the daughters in the process of transforming them into a mission.
If you had no co-operation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would not have been complete.
Financial, thank you for your phone call.
I have no secret to tell the truth.
It makes it easier to understand anyone until the old ages in our lives are reduced.
At times, we talk about the gap between the elderly and the elderly in the age group.
In fact, it is very low to talk to the majority of the elderly.
I have always been trying to interact with the youth through exclusive programmes and social networks.
I have always been trying to explain what they do or what they think.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I have been giving a lot of importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I don't have the time to waste the youth. This thing helps the younger generation to build more innovation because they want to finish things quickly.
It seems to us that today's youth are more efficient and enormous.
Well, let them realise great dreams and achieve great successes.
Some say that younger generations are doing a lot of things at the same time.
I'm asking, what's wrong with this
At the same time, many workers are doing so.
If we take our vision around us, it will be a social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports and other sectors, it will be a big change in the society.
These young people start asking questions and have the power to dream.
If we make the ideas of youngsters on the earth, if we provide an independent environment to shape them, then we can make a positive change in the country.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vinitha ji MyGov, I want you to talk about the Constitution Day to be held tomorrow, November 26.
If this day is special, he has recorded that in 70 years we have adopted our Constitution.
Sir, thank you very much for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
This is the day when we think of the persons who have given us constitutional law.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It took 2 years, 11 months and 17 days to the Constituent Assembly to complete the official work of the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, these great men have enacted such a broad and deep constitutional law.
Even today, the rapid pace they have enacted the Constitution is an example of time management and productivity.
We are also encouraging to conclude time by deliberating our responsibilities in achieving success.
The significance of our Constitution is that it is described in detail about rights and obligations.
It is a memorable event involving young people to awaken the awareness of the Constitution and link them with the various parameters of the Constitution.
In 2020, as a Republic, we will complete 70 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us take the values of our Constitution forward and ensure peace, development and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, you should not forget the participants of that gentleman who was the centre of the Constitution.
That's the great man, the heroine doctor.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas is December 6th.
I pray to Baba Saheb for the sake of all the people of the country and he has given the right to live with dignity to millions of Indians.
Democracy is one of Baba Saheb's nature, and India's democratic value is not imported from outside.
What is democracy, what is the parliamentary system is not new to India.
And again, I pray you, once again, for Baba Saheb my servant.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji was celebrated and next year in 2019 we will be celebrating his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji always thought of human welfare.
He always paved the way for opportunity, work, service, compassion and brotherhood in society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been very well-known in this regard.
Similarly, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
And there will be a train on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Dev.
When I was present at a meeting associated with this, I was reminded of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara suffered a major impact.
But it is still an example that the state government has reconstructed it in collaboration with those circles.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat, we will meet again in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, today I have the opportunity to unveil the feelings of Mann Ki Baat for the first time.
The more I connect with you, the more our journey will be deeper and it will be a joyous meeting for all.
The question of what I got from Mann Ki Baat can be raised in some people's minds.
Today, I want to tell you that through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, one of these things is touching my heart. When everyone in the family sits together and listens to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, our family leaders sit among us and share our issues with us.
Your comforts, my blessings.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your desires are anointed, and my desires are anointed.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On October 31, the birth anniversary of our great Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the Eklavya Movement.
The climate is at present.
Therefore, I would like to urge a large number of people to participate in the Unity Movement.
About six months before the independence of the country, on January 27, 1947, the world famous International Journal, Taym, was released with the photograph of Sardar Patel on its first side.
In the headlines of the newspaper, they also released India's map
But that map is not the same as it is now.
The map showed India as a leaflet.
It consisted of over 550 settlements.
When they left the country, they were thinking that India should be a variety of poles.
The Time commented that India faces various threats such as partition, violence, food deficit, price rise and power politics.
The newspaper noted that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel could only help in integrating the country and healing the wounds of the people.
The article also highlighted the reflection of life history of India's iron man.
During the floods in Ahmedabad by 1920, the article included his handling of relief operations and his conduct of the Portuguese Satyagraha.
That was his sincerity and determination to give full confidence to the peasants, workers and entrepreneurs.
Sardar Patel resolved every issue in order to integrate the country, as it was intensifying the war through a single booking fear.
He ensured that all the continents of the country are connected to a united India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram or the continents of Rajasthan, if we are able to see an integrated India, then Sardar Patels vision and vision are the main reasons for this.
Built on the Narmada bank of Gujarat, this statue is double the height of the statue of the independent goddess of America.
This will be the highest statue of the world.
Every Indian will be proud of the world's tallest statue being built in India.
Sardar Patel, the real son of our soil, will decorate our airspace.
I believe that this statue, which has embraced Indian mother, will make every Indian proud.
It is natural for every Indian to feel the desire to see the statue of unity.
I am confident that this statue will be a place for people across the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, all of us celebrated Kalatbada Diwas yesterday.
I salute everyone who is part of Indias security forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
You must be aware of the fact that today we are celebrating Kalapattanam.
Indian troops took their footsteps in Kashmir this day and saved the valley from being caught in the grip of the occupation.
This incident is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview by our respected army officer Sham Manekshah.
In this, Field Marshal Sham Maneksha recalled the time he was Karnal.
Military operations started in Kashmir at that time.
At one of the meetings, Field Marshal Maneksha pointed out how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had slashed for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir, there should be no delay in sending troops and the problem should be resolved quickly and Sardar Patel gave him clear instructions.
After this, if our forces flew to Kashmir then we know how our army worked successfully.
The commemoration of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is on October 31.
Let us pay our respects to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who are those who do not want to sports
If our youngsters have these qualifications then our country will not only grow in the field of economic and scientific technology but also in the field of sports.
I am very happy to have two recent meetings.
I congratulated them and their determination to break the barriers and achieve success will be a source of inspiration for all of our countrymen.
Similarly, I got the immense opportunity to meet the winners of the 2018 Youth Summer Olympics in Argentina.
You are well aware that the work of our youth in the summer Olympics of 2018 has not been very good till now.
We got 13 medals in this competition and three medals in the combined dual segment.
You should think that the recent Asian Games have been a very good activity for Indian soldiers.
You must have noticed that I have often pointed out the word "very good or unprecedented achievement".
This is a reality that reflects the progress made by the sports sector of India every day.
India is making new achievements not only in the field of sports but also in the field of sports.
For instance, I would like to indicate to you the talented sportsperson, Narayan Thakur, who won the Gold in the Asian Games 2018 for the disabled persons.
He is an individual in his birth.
When he was eight, he lost his father.
After that, eight years of unsuccessful people lived in the house.
He then left the house, cleaning the buses of the Delhi Transport Corporation and working in roadside restaurants.
The same Narayan has won medals on behalf of India in international competitions.
Besides, it is also important to note how fast the Indian sports sector is getting.
Moreover, India has not yet won medals in the Junior or Chinese category in the Judo contest.
However, the youngsters have won India's Tababi Devi silver medal in the Olympics and made a historic achievement.
The 16-year-old Tababi Devi belongs to a village in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker, a mother doing fishing business.
It's a time when there's no money to buy food.
In such a poor state, his zeal and dedication have not diminished.
He has made history by winning medals for the country.
The entire world also appreciated the success of this competition.
The World Cup for the 17-year-old FIFA has achieved a record number of eyewitnesses in the field.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen competitive competitions in different sports halls in the country and have given a big boost to the youngsters.
This year, we have got the opportunity to host the 2018 World Cup in Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup hockey competition is scheduled to be held from November 28 to December 16.
Every Indian, whether he plays any game or is interested in sports, will definitely be interested in the hockey competition.
In the hockey sports, India has made achievements to be smashed by gold.
India has won gold medals in various events and has won the World Championship once.
India has also created a lot of best hockey soldiers.
Whenever we quote about the hockey sports, we cannot finish it without mentioning our achievements.
The name of Major Diyan Chand, considered to be Hockey's father, is famous all over the world.
Further, the Indian hockey has a long tradition from Balbir Singh Cheneyar, Leslie Gladius Mohamed Shahid, Utham Singh to Tanrajpalli.
Even today, the soldiers present in the Indian team are encouraging younger generations if they look towards their hard work and goal.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see rare competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourag the Indian teams and the brave men who are playing there.
The state of Odisha is not only a historical background but also a cultural heritage.
All the people of that state are extremely oppressed.
This is a great opportunity for sportspersons to visit Odisha.
The world famous sports hubs like Konark Sun Temple, Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake can also be enjoyed.
I assure them that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I convey my best wishes to all the teams participating in this competition from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the mood of the social workers is really a source of inspiration and enthusiasm for all the people of the country.
But in the present new era, new generations are revived and enthusiastic with innovative methods that can fulfil their dreams.
I participated in the inaugural function of a new website called 'My Government for Community'. My Government and the IT and Electronics Industry of the country have started this document to encourage workers to work in social activities and to provide them with opportunities to work in this field.
Their dedication and valour will make every Indian proud.
I am not- we have transformed society from individuals into a new ecosystem for social work among IT departments.
Some people sing to older people
Some people have dedicated themselves to cleanliness and some others are helping the farmers.
But there is no perspective behind anyone's action, and their determination is driven.
However, one who sits in the Chakra chair and learns to play basket, can help the talented sportspersons who play talents and sportspersons.
This feeling and dedication is a process of action.
This will make every Indian proud.
I am not, we will certainly be attracting all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, while looking at your suggestions on today's Mann Ki Baat, the idea of Puducherry was very encouraging.
My Government app has said that the tribal people, their traditions and rituals have become an example of the natural environment.
He said how to pursue the tradition of tribals in our lives and achieve sustainable development and what can be known from such traditions.
I congratulate you for presenting this issue among the leaders of the Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will inspire us to understand our dignified past and ancient traditions while examining new ways to discuss environment protection and pursue a balanced lifestyle.
Our country is facing the same problem.
But if we need to find solutions then we must remember our past and understand our traditional heritage, particularly the way we live in our tribal people.
Music is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, vegetation and flowers as Gods.
The 'Bil' tribal people reside in central India, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, live on the trees of Bipal and Arjun.
Fishnoys residing in the desert region of Rajasthan are guiding us to protect the environment.
In particular, they are prepared to give their lives rather than damage to a tree.
The Mishmi tribal people of Arunachal Pradesh are closely associated with the LTTE.
They regard the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the LTTE has become forest guards.
The people of Warli in Maharashtra regard the LTTE as their guests, and they regard the LTTE as a reflection of their prosperity.
The Coal Ethnic of India, the LTTE views it as a direct link to their lives and feels that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be hungry.
Fishermen of India also stop fishing in the Catholic river during the period of fishing.
They consider this area as a fish sanctuary and think that due to this belief amongst them, sound fishes will get hugely.
In addition, the tribal people are building their habitations with strong and environment friendly natural resources.
The people of Todar, who live in some individual areas of the Nilgiri mountain range of southern India, have only made their homes available in the area.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is the testimony that the tribal people believe in living very peacefully and consistently, and if someone tries to harm or harm their natural resources, they will not be reluctant to fight for their rights.
There is no wonder that many of our freedom fighters are the leading soldiers and tribals.
No one can forget Lord Birsa Munda, who fought hard against British imperialism in order to protect their forests.
Besides my definition so far, we can list a lot of tribal societies about how to live in harmony with nature and we are very obliged to our tribal people to keep the existing forests and forests in the country continuously.
Everyone should come forward to express our gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, we have mentioned about individuals and organisations that have played a vital role for the society on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
But these things are not enough, but they have provoked immense sentiments in our thoughts to show a new way of working for the society.
A few days ago, I read about the farmer brothers named Kurbachan Singh from Panchayat.
The marriage of the son of Kurbachan Singh, the farmer brother who is working hard, will take place.
Kurbachan Singh has made a definite statement to the parents of the bridegroom that the wedding should be done very easily.
He said there was no need to spend huge amounts for wedding reception or any other matter.
He said this must be regarded as a very ordinary dilemma, and has suddenly set a settlement.
He is determined to assure that women will not burn straw and agricultural wastes in their homes, their crops.
You should think well about the social strength of this idea.
But it shows how high his quality is, how many families in our society can feel that how they are solving their personal problems for the entire society.
The family of Thiruvananthapuram Kurbachan Singh has shown us such an example.
I also read about the village Kartarmajra near Pandian Naba.
Instead of burning the stars, the village of Kartarmajra has been brought to light by farmers who followed the new technique of soil mixing them with soil.
My congratulations to Gurbachan Singh
My congratulations to the people of Karmajra village and all those who have not been polluted around them.
You all are becoming the real guidance of taking forward the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
As the sea becomes, every positive activity is essential to create a good environment.
My dear countrymen, our archaeologies also mention this thing: In all three worlds, there must be peace around us in all the works of water, air, land, fire, breathing, medicines, vegetation, gardens and deep depth.
Every soul between me and you, every heart and this phenomenon should be peaceful.
Eat . .
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be fabricated by golden texts.
As far as India is concerned, November 11 this year is important because the First World War ended on November 11, a hundred years ago.
It is a hundred years since the end of that war, and we feel that the catastrophe and human casualties are over and over a hundred years.
For India, the First World War is very important.
In fact, we have no direct connection with that war.
However, our soldiers have bravely fought and sacrificed the highest number of martyrs in that war.
Indian soldiers have also said that if it comes to war, Indians are not sad for anybody.
Our soldiers have expressed their courage and valour in difficult areas and in bad weather.
The only purpose was to create peace.
This world knows that there has been a large number of deaths and goods during the First World War.
Around one crore soldiers and as many innocent people died.
This is what the whole world has realized the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace needs global cooperation and coordination not only to war, but also to address terrorism, climate change, social change and economic growth.
The development of the poor is a genuine example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern states have a unique uniqueness.
There is no link between the natural beauty of the North-Eastern states - the people of this region are very talented.
At present, the North-Eastern states have been famous for their excellent work.
The North-Eastern region has made great progress in organic farming.
In order to promote sustainable food processing, the State of Sikkim has received the Gold Award for the precious future policy for 2018 a few days ago.
Not only this, Sikkim has won this award by postponing the recommendations received from 25 countries.
For this, I heartily congratulate the people of Sikkim.
I believe that such festivals will be an opportunity to adopt new promises.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you grow, this country will grow.
My best wishes to you all.
