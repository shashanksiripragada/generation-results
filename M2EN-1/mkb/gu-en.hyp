Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
My dear countrymen, today is the festival of Deepavali.
My best wishes to you all on Diwali.
It says: Prakash brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys the opposite intellect and shows integrity.
Who else could have better ideas than this to remember this Divyojana, let us spread the light, spread the positiveness and pray to destroy the spirit of hostility.
Today, Deepavali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that it does not merely include the Indian community, but now the festival of Deepavali is celebrated with full fervor by the governments of many countries, the citizens of that region and the social organisation of that place.
In a way, India grows there.
Friends, Festival tourism is also an attraction in the world.
There are immense possibilities of festival festivals in our country.
Our effort should be to spread such festivals, be it Holi, Deepavali, Onam, Pongal or Bhihu, and also include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of the festivals.
There are several different festivals of every politician of every state that the people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians outside the country is also very important in increasing the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in Gai Mann Ki Baat that this Deepawali will do something different.
I said - Let us celebrate India's sovereignty and achievements, i. e.
Immediately after this, inspiring stories on social media came to an end.
Namo has written on the app that my mother is my strength.
My mother had taken up the responsibilities of our five daughters since my father died in 10th century.
Today, we are the fifth brother in good business.
My mother is God for me.
This is the inclusion for me and that is the real meaning of India's laxity.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
Deepika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for him, Major Khushbu Kanwar is the Laxmi of India, the daughter of a bus conductor.
India's Laxmi is his daughter for poetry.
He is proud that his daughter makes beautiful pictures.
He has received a very good rank in the CLAT examination.
So Medha Jainji has also written that an old woman of 2 years has been fed free water to travellers on Gangotri railway station for years.
Medhaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
Many stories have been shared by people.
You must read, inspire and share yourself if you have such an inspiring story.
I respectfully congratulate all these lacs of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 17th century.
How beautiful words, how good spirit and how excellent the idea is in this poem of Kannada language.
Panninda Permegondnu Himawantnu, Panindra Bhrigu Perchidanupananda Janakarayanu Jaswadanu Arthat, Heemavant i. e.
Our daughters are our pride and the glory of these daughters is a strong identity of our society and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, 12th November, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak ji's influence is not only in India but in the old world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters in some countries of the world are fully dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji's ideals.
I can never forget my visit to Vancouver and Tahiran to the Gurudwara.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can tell you, but for this one should slap a lot of Mann Ki Baat.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji conveyed his message to the far flung world.
He was one of the most travellers in his times.
Wherever they went, they won their hearts with ease, humility and simplicity.
With the message of goodwill and equality, people have received saints and saints everywhere, whether in the north, east or west.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankar Dev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He travelled to the sacred land of Haridwar.
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Devji was there.
He also visited religious places like Christianity and Gaya.
Guru Nanak Devji visited Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji himself had solved the problem of water there.
Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is a famous place in Bidar, which also reminds us of Guru Nanak Devji.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north.
This led to a close relationship between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet where people considered him a Guru.
He is also venerable in Uzbekistan, where he travelled.
He added that lakhs of people have got a place in their hearts, who have followed their teachings with full faith and are still doing it today.
Just a few days ago, the princes of about 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar, and all this became the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Thereafter, several princes put forward their testimony on social media and shared their good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that on 31st October, you will certainly be remembered.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who was the great man who served the nation in the light of unity.
In Sardar Patel, where people had the immense potential to connect together, on the other hand, those who had ideological differences also shared their coordination with them.
He was a man of details in the true sense.
He was also accompanied by a collective skill.
He was invited to prepare and streamline the schemes.
Whenever we read about Sardar Saheb's work, we hear it, we know how well his event was.
In 121, thousands of delegates from across the country were to attend the Congress office in Ahmedabad.
He also used this opportunity to improve the network of water supply in the city.
And ensured that no one has any problem with water.
Moreover, he also took care of the fact that the goods or steps of a representative should not be stolen at the place of office and you would be very new to know what Sardar Patel did.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to make Khadi pillars.
On the other hand, Khadi sales also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Patel has done a very important and historic task of uniting the regimes as the first Home Minister of India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai also had a special feature that his eyes were at every stage.
On one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his attention was on Dussehra Lakshadweep.
When we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in the integration of the country is also discussed.
Immediately after the partition of India in 1944, the sight of our sisters was on the verge of Lakshadweep and she sent the ship with her flag.
It was learnt from Sardar Patel that without spending time immediately, he immediately started drastic action without delay.
Immediately after his order, the Tricolor was flown and the aim was to create confidence in every mindset of the country.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told Mudaliyar brothers that they should ensure individual support for the development of the target.
Today, the goal is contributing significantly to India's progress.
It is also an attractive tourist spot.
I hope all of you will visit these beautiful islands and Kohima.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the Statue of Unity created in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the highest statue of the world.
The State of America is twice as high as the Statue of Liberty.
The highest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride.
The height of every Hindustani is greatly elevated.
You will be happy to know that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists arrived to visit the Statue of Unity.
This means that everyday about eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a subject for tourism industry for the country and for all the states.
We all believe that within a year, a place is developed as a world famous tourist destination.
People from all over the world come there.
We are developing a very good system of transportation, lodging, guides and environment friendly arrangements one by one.
A huge economy is developing and people are creating facilities according to the needs of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, Whether it is a matter of pride that in the last few days, Time Magazine has also given importance to the Statue of Unity in the 100 important tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that you all will be able to see the Statue of Unity by taking some time out of your precious times.
This is my quest.
Friends, You know that the National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting our country's unity, integrity and security at any cost.
Unity Run for Unity is being organised on 31st October as usual.
It will involve people from every section of the society.
Anyway, everyday there is a grief and a lot of grief for the Marathon in the people.
The Run for Unity has also provided a unique feature.
Running is beneficial for all of them.
Fit India's feelings are fulfilled by running here.
At the same time, we are also connected with the goal of an India-Best India.
And that is why not only the body, but also the mind and culture are connected to the unity of India, to bring India to new heights.
And therefore, whatever city you live in, you can get connected to your neighbourhood by getting advice about the Run for Unity.
I hope you all will run on 31st October for India's unity and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country on the threshold of unity.
This mantra of unity has become like a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity on every aspect at every level.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
If we want to be around us, there will be so many examples that have been continuously working to enhance mutual understanding.
But sometimes it becomes such that the contribution of the society becomes very quick from memory.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had filed its responsibilities on Ramjanmabhoomi.
Just remember the days when there was an atmosphere.
They were playing a game to take advantage of this situation in their own way.
What kind of language was being spoken to produce heat in the environment
In different voices, efforts were also being made to fill the gap.
Efforts have been made to reduce the temperature from the atmosphere.
We should always remember that it gives us a lot of strength.
That day, that moment is a tribute to all of us.
This is an example of the great power that the voice of unity can give to the country.
Today, I pay my homage to him.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have heard these things, so I think I have read you too.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield or jayan temperature goes from zero to 50-60 degrees.
Oxygen is also the only name in the air.
It is no less than a phenomenon to be among such challenges in such a contradictory context.
In such a difficult situation, our brave-hearts are not only protecting the borders of the country but they are also running a Clean Siachen Mission.
I appreciate the people of the country for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is also difficult to rotate.
In such a situation, it is a very important thing in itself to create and manage waste.
We all know that Siachen is a snow laden region which is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the cleanliness drive is meant to ensure pure water for people living in critical areas as well as water from rivers like Nubra and Syok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a celebration of a new consciousness in the lives of all of us.
And, especially in Deepavali, every family has a size of buying some new ones, bringing some others out of the market.
I once said that we should try to buy only local things.
If we get our requirements from our villages then there is no need to go to the toilets.
If there is a balance then there is no need to go to the district.
We will try to buy more local items.
Gandhi Saradhatab will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been urging that we should purchase the sufficient amount of money made by our wealthy brothers and sisters by the workers of Khadi.
This Deepawali will also have bought a lot of money from Deepawali earlier.
However, many people would have thought that if we go after Diwali then perhaps we will get a little cheaper.
There will be many people who will still be left to buy.
With the auspicious wishes of Deepawali, I would like to urge you to become the leader of buying local goods.
You can see how important we can play in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
In Deepawali, we have species of species of cracks.
However, there is a hurdle in the absence of any kind.
How many injuries are there.
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fanfare.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Fortunately, there will be an Indian who will not be proud of our armed forces, our soldiers.
Every Indian, whether it is in any field, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated the Parikrama Parv.
We recalled the surgical strike in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to those who were inspired by the guise of terrorism on our nation.
Our Armed Forces organised exhibitions at different places in the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, know what our strength is, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by risking their lives.
The Parakram Parv reminds the youth of the glorious legacy of our Armed Forces.
And inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Now it has been decided that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our nation.
We believe in peace and are committed to encouraging it, but by compromising with dignity and that too on the value of the sovereignty of the nation, not at all.
India has always been committed and committed to peace.
In the 20th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their best for peace in the two world wars and when we had no links with that war.
We never looked at any other land.
It was our commitment to peace.
Just a few days ago, on September 23, we remembered our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur lensors, who liberated Haifa from the revolutionaries on the completion of hundred years of Haifa fight in Israel.
It was also a convocation by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest armed forces in the UN peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
During the Republic Day celebrations, there is one of the most urgent components of the Paradise which is waiting for the people, the Fly Pass in which our Air Force exhibits its strength along with the unprecedented caravans.
On October 8, we celebrate World War Day.
Our Air Force has joined the 21st centurys most adventurous and powerful Air Force today, with 6 pilots and 1 air warriors in 132 years.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Warriors and their families who have served for the country.
In 1944, when Pakistan's attackers launched an unprecedented attack, the Air Force was the only one who ensured that Indian soldiers and equipment reach the battlefield in time to save Srinagar from the attackers.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1911
Air Force has also played an important role in eliminating Kargil from the casualties in 1991.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force smoked them by bombing the enemy at night.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful to them for the commendable work of our air warriors.
Their mindset has been immensely amazing to combat natural calamities from the floods, floods to the jungles and help the countrymen.
The Air Force has shown examples in ensuring the equality of women and men in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments for the country's daughters.
Now the Air Force is also giving women an option of the Convent Commission along with the Short Service Commission which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that not only men power but also women power is being contributed in the armed forces of India.
Nari is not only powerful but is also becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, an officer of the Navy, Abhilash Tomy, was fighting for his life and death.
The entire country was wondering how to save the tommy.
You are aware that Abhilash Tommy is a very courageous officer.
He was the first Indian to travel around the world with a small boat without any modern technologies.
For the past 80 days, he was moving ahead with his pace in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe race in the South Indian Ocean, but he created a terrible sea storm for him, but the brave soldiers of the Navy of India continued to wait for several days in the sea.
I had also met the Tommy earlier.
Even after coming out of such a difficult situation, his strength was strong and once again the resolve to do something like this is an inspiration for the youth of the country.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tomy and his courage, his determination, determination and victory will inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child knows the importance of 2 October for our nation.
2 October this year has a special significance.
For two years from today, we are organizing several events across the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Whether it is Martin Luther King Junior or great scholars like Nelson Mandela, they have fought a long battle to gain strength from Gandhiji's ideas and to give a sense of equality and respect to their people.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss with you another important task of worshipping Bapu, which more and more people of the country should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a Constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle took a boost, he prepared a revised net of those ideas.
Revered Bapu has put forward his views on many topics such as protecting the rights of farmers, villages and labourers, cleanliness and spread of education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Pujya Bapu was a folk singer.
It was the speciality of Bapu that connected people and connected them with him.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every person feel that it is the most important and responsive thing for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
Every section of the society, every section of the society, has dedicated itself to Mahatma Gandhi's leadership in the freedom struggle.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which is sometimes known as Gandhijis penance.
In this, Gandhiji said, I am giving you one gentleman. Whenever you are convinced that if you start to dawn on you, then try this joke. Remember the faces of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen and ask your heart what will be useful for the man who thinks of taking steps
Will it benefit from this
Can it keep something wrong with its own life and destiny
That is, can crores of people get Swaraj, who are hungry and self-reliant
Then you will see that your doubts are curing and the end is happening here.
My dear countrymen, even today one gap of Gandhiji is equally important.
Today, the rising middle class of the country, its growing economic power, the growing purchasing power, can we remember Bapu for a moment if we go to buy anything
Can we remember that gate of venerable Bapu
What would be lucky that will benefit from your purchase directly or rigorously
And if the poor benefits the poorest of the poor, then my happiness will be more than the other.
Whenever we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji in the days to come, we must think that every one of our purchases requires the wishes of the countrymen and those who have sacrificed their sweat, those who have dedicated their money to their talent, all of them should benefit from it.
This is Gandhi's message. And I believe that the poorest and the weakest person, your small step in his life can bring a big result.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that when he was clean, he would not know how he would be, but that happened, India got independence.
Similarly, today we can feel that even this small task of my country can have a huge contribution in the economic progress, economic empowerment and fighting against poverty. And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era.
For example, if we think of buying Khadi and handloom products on special occasions, it will help many traders.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastriji used to keep the old or unscrupulous clothes of Khadi intact because somebody's hard work is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes are very hard-working, one vision of this should come to work.
This small pool of love for the countrymen and the countrymen was built in the rage of that great man.
After two days we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji along with venerable Bapu.
As soon as the name of Shastri ji comes, the feeling of unlimited faith in the minds of the people of India emerges.
His gentle personality always fills every countrymen with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had a special feature that he looked very humble from outside but he was determined as a mountain from within.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan's letter is a recognition of his immense personality.
His self-confidence towards the nation was that during his one and a half year brief tenure, he had given mantras to the country's soldiers and the farmers at the peak of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are remembering venerable Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot remain without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called Swachhata Hi Seva started from 15th September.
Millions of people joined this campaign and I am also fortunate that I will do cleanliness with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation was laid by Babasaheb.
People from all over the country joined the workshop on this 15th day.
Institutions also contributed to this.
School students, college students, NCC (NCC), NSS, youth organizations, media groups, corporates, everyone has done a lot of sanitation work.
I heartily congratulate all these Swachhata loved countrymen for this thing.
Let's hear a phone call
You have said that cleanliness has its own significance in everyones lives and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, toilets have been constructed in your houses and now you are getting convenience.
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign may not be guessed that you cannot see it because of being a practitioner. But if you did not have toilets then you would have to spend your life with so many difficulties and after toilets it became such a big gift for you.
Perhaps you didn't have a phone call to talk about connecting this aspect. Perhaps this sensitivity doesn't come in the light of the people associated with this campaign of cleanliness.
I specially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the entire world.
This time, India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness conference in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention i. e. Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention and experts from all over the world are coming together to share their experiments and experiences regarding cleanliness.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude with the launch of 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Bapu on 2nd October 2018.
It is specially for the freedom, peace and justice of the oppressed, the victims and the underprivileged.
Dr.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Bangladesh.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on October 12, 13.
After a few days, the NHRC will complete 25 years.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to enhance human dignity.
Our beloved leader, the former Prime Minister of our country, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, has clearly stated that human rights are not a transition for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, an ideal instrument of Vedic period is marked.
NHRC has created widespread awareness for human rights and has also played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
In this 25-year journey, he has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the countrymen.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I believe that this is a very hopeful event.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
In the form of a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and behave in a manner that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it October, the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan, the birth centenary year of Jayaprakash Narayan ji, all these great men are inspiring us all, we salute them and on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, I will talk from the next Mann Ki Baat, but today I want to mention that on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on 31st October, at every small town of Hyderabad, in every small town of Gujarat, in every village of the country, in every village of the country, in the village of Mota.
This year too, we have tried to organise the Run for Unity in our villages, towns, cities and cities.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you that by 31st October, we should strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society and every section of the society through the Run for Unity and that will be a great tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Nanaji, today the entire nation is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has also been a great example of social harmony.
There are several such stories in the history of the country in which one Laxmi added two different states or religions to the penance of faith.
A few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also coming.
The entire elephant, horse, palanquin, Jai Kanaiah, Red Key, Govinda will be roaming around the world.
The joy of painting in the color of Lord Krishna is very different.
Defence and Birth Anniversary to all the countrymen.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the Sanskrit week.
I am extremely grateful to the daughter Chinmayi who raised this issue.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Shravani is also celebrated on the full moon day.
I congratulate all those who are trying to protect, nurture and reach out to the people of this great legacy.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud of the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world.
And we all are proud of the fact that the language Sanskrit from Vedic to the present has played a very important role in the propagation of knowledge.
The balance of knowledge related to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which there is a possibility of the creation of infinite words.
20000 metals, 2000 liters i. e.
And that is why in any case, a subtle feeling or subject can be expressed at once.
That is, if a Guru enlightens his disciple of a letter then there is no such thing in the whole earth that the disciple can surpass his Guru.
Let us celebrate such a teacher day with this feeling that knowledge and guru are invaluable, priceless and priceless.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the next Teachers Day.
I thank you for your dedication to socio-economic science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, these hardworking people bring the fourth new hopes for our farmers.
Strengthening in the sun gives plenty of relief to dry trees and dry roots.
However, sometimes it also brings floods and floods.
Nature has emerged as such that there have been more rains in some places than others.
Just now, we have seen that Kerala has had a very serious impact on the lives of the people.
Today, the entire country is accompanied by Kerala in this difficult moment.
Our brotherhood is with those families.
I am very confident that Kerala will be re-established very soon on the strength of the people of the state for their courage and indomitable courage.
But we also see humanity during disasters.
Whether it is Kerala or any other district of India, or regions, it is confined to every parent from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.
People associated with all age groups and every field of work are contributing.
We all know that the Armed Forces are the dryness of the survival in Kerala.
He did not leave any stone unturned to save the poor.
Whether it is air force, naval force, ground force or BSF, CISF, RAF, everyone has played a very important role in rescue and relief operations.
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of NDRF going to Bahadur.
The topic on which people from all over the country have written is our favorite Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonpit, Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Akhil Pandey from Katihar, Bihar, who knows many innumerable people have written on Narendra Modi mobile app and on May Gov and asked me to talk about different aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the 16th of August, the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's passing away.
A nation leader who left the Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he had gone so far from active politics.
The kind of affection, devotion and grief for Atal ji, which has emerged across the country, shows his great personality.
For the past several days, the best aspect of Atal ji has come before the country.
India will always be Atal ji's departure for the First Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation has brought about two important changes in India's politics.
In the first instance, the size of the Cabinet was restricted to 15 of the size of the Assembly Constituencies.
Secondly, the limit prescribed under the Anti-Pacific Act increased from one third to two thirds.
Clear guidelines have also been decided to disqualify the parties.
For many years, the political culture of forming big ministers in India was built not for the sharing of work but for the sake of enjoyment of politicians.
Atal ji changed this culture.
Their steps saved money and resources.
Its collaborative efficiency also increased.
It was Atal ji who changed the situation and implemented a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atalji was a true patriot.
In 2017, Atal ji changed the time of introduction of the budget from five o'clock in the evening to 11 a.m.
In this way, he brought our loved Tricolor closer to the people.
I will certainly say that for healthy democracy, for good democracy, for good traditions, for strengthening democracy, for open minded discussions, it will also be an excellent tribute to Atal ji.
Just a few days back, the fourth session of Parliament has been completed.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 4.
And the result is that the Lok Sabha passed the 14th Vidhan Sabha in this session.
This House of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of the youth.
Several important legislatures benefiting the youth and the backward classes were passed in this session.
You all know that for decades, there was a demand for setting up of OBC Commission like the Scheduled Castes - Tribals.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward class, the country has made a pledge to set up the OBC Commission this time.
The session also undertakes amendments to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes community.
Sathosath will prevent criminals from committing adultery on the people of this class and irrigate trust among the Dalit communities.
No member of the society can tolerate any kind of injustice against the country's Nari Shakti.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Overseas Law Amendment Bill and has provided serious punishment to such criminals and the ills of misdeeds will be punished for at least 10 years.
As soon as children below 12 years of age, those who commit adultery will be punished with fatigue.
A few days back, it must have been read in the newspapers that in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, a court has completed the hearing in just two months and punished two criminals of a crime on a segregation.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had punished the culprits after only five days of hearing.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts there have given such speedy payments.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing cases of crime against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time, we have presented an ideal in the twenty-fourth session.
Today, I express my gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, today the attention of millions of countrymen is on the Asian sports that are playing in the world.
Everyday in the morning, people watch the first newspapers, TV, news and social media and see that any Indian player has won the moonlight.
Asian sports are still underway.
I want to congratulate all the players who have won the moonlight for the country.
My best wishes to the sportspersons whose competitions are still there.
Indias sportspersons are particularly excellent in Magnebaji and Kusti, but our sportspersons are also bringing memories in such sports where we have not been as good as before, sports like Woods and Ships.
This is not merely a moon, but a prize. The sky of Indian sports and sportspersons is full of passion and dreams.
Our daughters are among the increasing number of people who have won the moonlight for the country, this is a very positive sign.
Similarly, among the youngsters who have won the moon, we are the youth of the age group of 15-16 years.
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won the moon are living in small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success through hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons and also pay my homage to Shri Dhyan Chand ji, the Chief Guest of Hockey.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play sports and sports, as a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then a bright future of India will be created.
Namaste Bhavnaji, I respect your spirit.
But can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a huge mountain which was once full of rocks was given the shape of an excellent large and unique temple, perhaps it is difficult to imagine, but it was such a thing.
And this is the temple - the Kailasnath Temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra, if anyone tells you that a 60 meter long pillar of granite was constructed about a thousand years ago and a corner of 80 tonnes of granite was laid on its summit.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur of Tamil Nadu is such a place where architecture and engineering can be observed.
He was surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patna, Gujarat.
India's Bhumi Engineering Laboratory has been there.
There have been many engineers in India who have made a minority and have presented examples of engineering as a wonder in the world.
In our legacy of the great engineers, we have also received such a chapter whose work is still being done by the people.
M.
In those parts of the country, they are worshipped but the rest of the country also remembers them with great respect and spirituality.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers' Day.
The engineers of our country have made their mark all over the world by walking on their footprints.
When I talk about the miracles in the world of engineering, I am reminded of a horrible incident in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
So I got the opportunity to go to a village and I got the opportunity to meet a demand of more than 100 years of age.
He looked at me and was enjoying our joy and was saying, Look, this is my house.
In Kutch it is called Bhungo.
This house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
But you will not find any harm.
This house was built by our ancestors in accordance with the natural condition of this place.
And it was a matter of great pride that I thought that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created local conditions because of which the common man was safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers' Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be held at different places.
How do we have to learn new things in the changing times
You have to learn .
You have to connect .
What should students be taught
How does ero West become our priority
We must think of many such things as we celebrate Engineers Day.
My dear countrymen, this is the atmosphere of festivals.
And with this, preparations for Diwali also start.
My best wishes to everyone along with a similar spirit.
Thank you, I will meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So, at some places people are still waiting for rain.
The vastness and diversity of India sometimes shows the favourite nature of rain.
But what should we do to rain
It is human beings who have chosen the path of conflict with nature and the result is that sometimes nature curses us.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day, Kissat was just a second acceptance.
When he was walking inside the cave then suddenly a good water accumulated near the cave entrance due to heavy rains.
The way out of them was closed.
Due to lack of access to any road, they stayed on a small scale inside the cave.
And that too is not a day or two.
On the one hand, he was facing difficulties.
On the other hand, humanity in the entire world was demonstrating the human qualities preserved by Ishwar.
People from all over the world were praying to take these children out of peace.
The responsibilities at every level were unique.
Whether it is government, parents of these children, family members, media or citizens of the country, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone has done a unique job.
All of them were joining their missions as a team.
I believe that everybody's legitimate behaviour is like a learning subject.
It is not like that the parents are not sad, it is not like that tears are not curtailed in the eyes of the mothers, but the quiet attitude of the entire society is like learning for all of us.
It shows that whenever there is a summary of humanity, there is a wonderful thing.
A few days ago, our country's favorite poet Neeraj ji took a pledge from us.
Every word of Neeraj ji can give us a lot of strength and inspiration.
While examining the board of our school, we talked about the stress and surveillance of exams and your condolences for students like me are now a message.
However, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and all the youth.
This is the time when the college has a very difficult time.
Millions of youth like Satyam get out of school and get into college.
If we go to February and March examinations, papers and answers, the results are spent on holidays in April and May as well as on setting a road ahead in life, selecting a career etc.
The attention of the students is limited from home to school.
Students come under the scanner of their parents.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time we have to come out of the house, leave the village and come out of a defensive environment and become our friends.
All such youngsters have to leave their homes for the first time and lead their lives in a new direction.
I would like to tell all of you that be calm, believe in life, take full pleasure of interference in life.
Let us learn new languages like new skills and new languages.
He has already succeeded in the examination of MBBS of Jodhpur AIIMS.
Their fathers nurture waste to their families.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are many students who come from poor families and despite their opposite concerns, they have done something that inspires us all.
The Prime Minister of Delhi, who has a bus driver in DTC, or a great Gupta of Kolkata who studied under the stretch of the footpath, the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afrien Shaikh, who runs an autorickshaw.
However, the Divyang Divyang Panda of Gurgaon, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called Spanish Muscular Etrophy, since birth.
All of them have succeeded in seeing the entire world by spreading all obstacles with their determination and courage.
If we want to be with us, we will also get some such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives strength to my mind and inspires me.
And when I tell you the story of these youngsters then I remember the story of poet Neeraj ji and this is the goal of life.
I was talking to two Indian youth in San Jose City, USA, once known as Technology Hub.
I appealed to him to think about how he can use his talent for India and take time out.
Mr. Brain Drain was requested to convert him into Brain Gain.
Both the IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee have made an innovative effort to overcome this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji, together with their professional skills, have prepared a smart goal app.
This app is not just connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they can get any information on their mobile phones.
These residents of Taudhakpur village of Rae Bareli, Sarpanch, District Magistrate, Telugu Development Officer, all of them made the people aware of the use of this app.
It is now easy to keep an eye on the progress made by the App to record the development work being done in the village.
The App consists of the phones of the village, Directorate of Information, List of events, Health Centres and Wellness Centres.
The Grameen Feature of App works as a market for farmers in a way as a faculty rate.
If you look at this incident carefully, one thing will be noticed that those who have left India many years ago, those youngsters who know the significance of their villages, understand the challenges and are associated with the village.
This is the reason why perhaps the villages could be properly constructed and they could make it better.
Every Indian is naturally involved in this feeling of imbibing his village, his origin and his life.
However, sometimes due to some distance, sometimes due to some conditions, there is a thin stretch on it, but if they get touched by any such irritation then good things will emerge again.
Pandharpur is truly a unique journey.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, who was 23rd July this time, is celebrated as a grand legend of Pandharpur Warrior.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Approximately 15-20 days prior to the Ashwadi Ekadashi, the pilgrimage to Pandharpur with Vakari i. e.
This journey, which is called Varanasi, is linked to lakhs of workers.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of the great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram.
Pilgrims Lord Vithal, who is also called Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vitthal protects the interests of the poor, the underprivileged and the victims.
How many people like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense devotion
There is a different experience of visiting the Vithoba Temple in Pandharpur and the beauty and spiritual pleasure of the month there.
It is my request to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat that if you get the opportunity then you must experience the history of Pandharpur.
Innumerable saints like Jnaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still teaching the people of Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against blindness.
Whether it is their loyalty or abhorrence, we get the message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them.
There is a mantra of fighting the society against blind faith.
These were the people who stopped the society from time to time, showed to them and ensured that the ancient rituals would eradicate from our society and irrigate the culture of compassion, equality and goodwill among the people.
We salute him on his birth anniversary and on his birth anniversary on 23rd July.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and intellectual power to showcase the blueprints of British rulers.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that they wished him thrice in 20 years and this is not a small issue.
Today, I would like to urge the countrymen to have a compassionate incident related to their statue in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad some 1000 years ago.
And during this visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel got an opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was so impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and as soon as Lokmanya Tilak ji died on 11th August, he decided that he will build a memorial of Tilak ji in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue was constructed and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not by anybody else, but on 28th February, 12th at Khood Mahatma Gandhi.
And I am talking about that period of the British.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav started due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium for furthering the spirit of social awareness, community, harmony and equality among the people along with traditional faith and oppression.
However, it was a time when the country had a dream for fighting against the British, these festivals had broken the caste and sectarian creeds and worked hard to compensate everyone.
Over time, the popularity of these events has increased.
And it is also known from this thing that what kind of craze this is in our youth for our ancient heritage and our brave leaders of history.
Today, in many cities, it is such that you can see the glimpse of Ganesh in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I also urged you to celebrate the festival of Ganesh, celebrate the festival of Ganesh, celebrate it with full strength, but to celebrate the festival of Eco-Friendly.
And I will say that the items of the Eco-Friendly Greece Festival should be put on May Gov and on Narendra Modi App for wide publicity.
I will bring your point to certain people.
Lokmanya Tilak gave a sense of confidence to the countrymen and he had instructed that Swaraj is our birthright, and we will follow it, even today it is time to say this.
Swaraj is our birthright and we will take it only.
Every Indian should reach good results of good governance and development.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrashekhar inspired many youngsters for the bravery and freedom of freedom.
Freedom has put its life on the horizon, but he never jumped in front of foreign rule.
I am fortunate that I also got the opportunity to visit Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I salute the two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship, held in Finland, created history by the brave daughter of India and Kisanputri Himalayan Das winning the Golden Championship.
In response to my letter, I have e-mailed me to Indonesia that now it is preparing for Asian Games.
The country has been named as Roshan.
World Para Athletics Grand Pre-2018 in Tunisia has won Gold and Bronze in 2018.
His achievement is special because he has made his challenges the way of his work.
Due to road accidents in 2003, half of the body of Dairy Ekta Bhaiya has become unemployed, but this daughter has achieved this achievement without losing courage and strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji has also won the Golden Jubilee in Berlin by winning the Golden Jubilee in Para Athletics Grand Pree Mother Champions.
My dear countrymen, several incidents of the history of August are full of festivals, but sometimes the diseases enter home due to mosquitoes.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the month of August inspired by patriotism, and for several centuries-old festivals.
Once again, we will get the requirement for Mann Ki Baat.
Thanks a lot.
Just a few days back, a historic cricket match was held in Bengaluru.
You must have understood a bit that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was the first International Match of Afghanistan and it is a matter of pride for the Indians that this historic Match of Afghanistan was with India.
In this match, both the teams performed very well and also performed very well in IPL this year at Rasheed Khan, the other speaker of Afghanistan. I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shriman Ashraf Ghani, technically wrote to me on his Twitter that the people of Afghanistan are extremely proud of their Hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have provided our sportspersons a platform to showcase their skills.
Rasheed represents the best in Afghanistan.
It is the world's essence of cricket and he also wrote in a funny manner that we should not give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
It is very natural to remember that this was the first match, but I would be remembered for some special reason.
The Indian team did something that is an example for the entire world.
He did what a winner team can do while taking the Indian team trophy.
The Indian team, while taking a trophy, invited the team of Afghanistan for the first time in the International Match of Afghanistan and made photographs with both the teams.
We can experience this in a way that what is sportsman spirit, what is sportsmanship.
It is a very good solution to integrate sports society and to find out the talent in our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that as soon as we come forward, we will also play with each other, along with the entire Sportsman Spirit.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, there was a separate stamp on Yoga Day.
The whole world looked together.
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Japanese Navy's fighter ships, people were seen doing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme of Yoga was organised and I was told that women had demonstrated many asanas.
The soldiers of India and China together performed Yoga on the high-rise Barfila peaks of Ladakh.
Yoga works to break and connect all the borders.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this occasion a big festival by going above all kinds of discrimination, caste, religion, region, color or linga.
If people from all over the world were enthusiastic and participating in Yoga Day programmes then why should it not be encouraged in India
It is a matter of pride for the country when 1. 25 billion people have seen that the security forces of our country have studied Yoga at three places in Navy, Thalsena and Air Force.
Some brave soldiers performed Yoga somewhere in Sabarmati, while some soldiers performed Yoga on the mountains of snow in Siachen.
Our Air Force warriors have sacrificed their lives by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth.
The message to see was that he did not sit on the plane but did yoga in the air immediately.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports fields, everywhere Yoga has happened.
A vision of Ahmedabad was touching the heart.
There, around 50 Divyang brothers and sisters have established a world record by doing Yoga together at one place.
I believe that the Agenda is working as a wellness and revolution.
I hope that the movement of wellness from Yoga will move forward.
Most people will make it a part of their lives.
Several people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App that I would like to talk about "Doctors Day" in Mann Ki Baat on 1st July.
This is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and gives them immense gratitude for their service and dedication towards society.
We are those who worship Mother as God, who believe in God because we live our lives.
If we give birth to our mothers, then sometimes the doctor gives us a new birth.
The role of the doctor is not limited to mere treatment of diseases.
Today doctors do not have medical expertise but they have a lot of experience about the impact of general lifestyle trends on our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark in the world with their capabilities and skills.
In Medical Profession, along with the Maharth, hardworking, our doctor is also known for resolving the complex medical products.
With the help of Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings to all our doctor friends on behalf of every countrymen on the eve of 'Doctors Day' coming on July 1.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India.
India has been a prosperous history when there is no such month or a day in which there is no shortage of historical incidents.
See, every place in India has its own legacy.
There is a saint, a great man, a famous person, everybody has his own contribution, his greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you will be aware of Gujarat's Kabirvad.
When I used to work there, I had done a very big national education for the people associated with the tradition of Saint Kabir.
You know why Kabirdas ji had come to Maghar
At that time there was a feeling that those who died in Maghar do not go to heaven.
The body that leaves it in a narrow caravan goes into heaven.
Maghar was regarded as an epidemic but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it.
He worked to break the same rituals and superstitions of his time, and hence he went to Maghar and resolved there.
Saint Kabir Das ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his stories and dawns.
He was his ideal.
We see these ideals in their creations and inspire them in today's era.
One of his tales is: - Kabir Soi Pir Hai, if there is no Peer on the Peerjo, Soka Pirate means that the true Peer Saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of another who does not know the pain of another.
Kabir Das ji gave special emphasis on social harmony.
He used to think far ahead of his time.
At that time, when the time of struggle and struggle was going on in the world, he gave a message of peace and harmony and worked to remove the differences by bringing together democracy.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he made several initiatives for the betterment of the society.
The system of cooking free of social discrimination where every species, penance, religion or community can come and eat, Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2017.
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I also urge you people to think about how to celebrate Guru Nanak Dev Ji's 550th birth anniversary in the entire society and around the world, how to celebrate it, how to create new ideas, how to create new ideas, how to create new ideas, how to create new ideas, how to create new ideas, how to create new ideas and how to create them with great pride.
The struggle for India's independence is very long, very broad, extremely hot, full of innumerable martyrs.
There is a history related to Punjab.
In 2017, even the horrific event of the Jallianwala Bagh has been completed 100 years, which has put humanity in shame.
Who can forget the dark day of 13th April, 11th when the pills were carried out on the innocent, unarmed and innocent people by crossing all limits of cruelty using power.
It always happens to be peace and violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written on Narendra Modi mobile app that Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee is the birth anniversary of Dr.
Talk to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Ramanji first thanked you very much.
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with several sectors but the areas that were closest to him were education, administrations and parliamentarians.
Very few people would be aware that Kolkata was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed Convocation at Kolkata University in Bangladesh.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development, built a strong base, prepared a strong platform.
The first Industrial Policy of Independent India in 1948 was published by him in the news of his ideas and visions.
Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every sector.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handicrafts, clothing and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were established between 148 and 150 for the good development of cottage and small scale industries.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee contributed a lot.
He was extremely dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
The result of their understanding, wisdom and activity is that a part of Bengal can be saved and it is a part of India today.
Dr.
Remembering the message of unity of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, remain connected to India's progress.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government functions through video bridge.
They got the opportunity to know directly about the changes that have been brought about in the lives of people by moving ahead of the files.
People talked about their resolve, their happiness and their achievements.
In remote villages, the services are being made available to the elderly of the village through a common service centre to make passports.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh joins Sitafal and does business by making it an ice cream.
Like the Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing affordable medicines in nearby villages.
No matter what kind of things the country has, there is no such thing in the country where people dont have to talk about their success.
In such a situation, when the common man brings about new hopes, new hopes and incidents in his life, then he is not the leader of the government.
Even a small child from a remote village becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion countrymen.
With the help of technology, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant and inspiring and it is not only a joy to work but also an excitement to do more.
A new joy, a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration to give life to the poorest of the poor is received.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people joined this video bridge programme and you have done the task of giving me new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we want to be around us, something is good somewhere or the other.
There are people who do good.
We can also experience the aroma of goodwill.
In the past, one thing has come to my mind and this is a unique combination.
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming and farming.
Now you would be wondering what is the relation between these two very different businesses
But it is such that in Bengaluru, corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together and they have made a comfortable trust and they have activated this Trust for doubling the income of the farmers.
They joined the farmers and made the jawans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today they are not only producing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through trust.
Farmers who produce grains are also associated with it.
On the one hand, there is a major role of farmers in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the participation of farmers in profit.
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment. And I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have come out of their borders to join the farmers, join the villages and join the fields.
I once again convey my best wishes to the young generation of my country for their innovative experiments. I must have known something or not.
GST is about to complete one year.
The dream of One Nation, One Tax has changed in reality today.
One nation, one tax reform, if I want to provide credit to anyone for this thing then I congratulate the states.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism where all the states together took decisions in the country and there was such a huge tax reform in the country.
So far, 2 meetings of GST Council have been held and we can all be proud that the people of different political parties are sitting there, the people of different states are sitting there, there are different states with different priority but the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken with all the consensus.
Prior to GST, there were 11 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being implemented in the entire country.
GST is a victory for honesty and is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier, there used to be complaints of Inspector Raj in the case of taxes in the country.
With the introduction of GST, the check post was stopped and the movement of goods and goods got faster, which has not only saved time but also benefitted from the logistics scam.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform.
Such a huge tax reform in India could have been successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST could be ensured through the manpower of the people.
It is generally believed that such a big reform, such a large country, it takes five to five years for the people to be completely stable. But the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the festival of honesty of the country is the result of the participation of the people that within a year this new tax system has created its place, has achieved stability and it is also being amended by its inbuilt system as per the requirement.
It has been a great success in itself by 1. 25 billion countrymen.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I look forward to waiting for my mind.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaz
Through Mann Ki Baat, once again I have got the opportunity to be present before you.
You would be well aware of the fact that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea journey for several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama Yes, I want to talk about it.
These six daughters of India, their team, travelled all over the world through the sea for more than four days, returned to India on 21st May and welcomed them very warmly.
He spent nearly twenty-two thousand nautical miles travelling across different oceans and many seas.
This was the first such event in the world.
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to hear the experiences of all these daughters.
If we want to travel to the development of human species then progress has been born from the adventure hub.
In the past, you must have seen that some new things have been noticed about those who roam on the Mount Tower and for centuries the Everest, the human race has been challenging and the brave people have been accepting that challenge.
On 16th May, a group of five tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra roamed at the highest peak of the world, including Pramesh Il, Umakanth Madvi, Kavidas Kammode, Vikas Soyam.
I congratulate the people of the school of Chandrapur, my young friends and my heart.
At present, 16-year-old Shivangi Chatti became the youngest Indian woman to cross the Everest from Nepal.
Many congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest became a pair of the first Indian Father-in-law.
It is not that only the youth are roaming Everest.
Sangeeta Bahele rotated the 1st May Everest and the age of music is more than 50.
There are also some people roaming at Everest who showed that they have not only skills but also sensitivity.
For years people have been roaming Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these brave hearts, especially the daughters and daughters.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, when I talked about Fit India two months ago, I did not think that there would be such a good impact on this thing.
In such a large number, the people of every region will be able to support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the country will play as much as we can.
People on social media are playing a video of fitness challenges and cheating them by tagging each other.
Everyone is joining this campaign of Fit India today.
Whether it is the people associated with the film, the people associated with KhelJagat or the common man of the country, the soldiers of the army, the teachers of the school, there is a buzz around - Ham Fit India Fit.
It is a matter of happiness for me that I too have been given the challenge by the captain of the Indian Cricket Team, Virat Kohli and I have accepted the challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and such challenges will encourage us to keep fit and others to remain fit.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that the sports that used to be a part of the lives of every child, are being lost today.
These sports were particularly a special part of the summer vacation.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
It is outside the house and also inside the house.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these sports.
The same game is known by different names in different places.
I am from Gujarat.
I know that there is a game in Gujarat.
It is played with the code or the other side of Ambali and the 88 square board.
This game was played in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Who would be one of us who has not played Moi Dandiya in his childhood
Moi Dandiya (Gilli Danda) is playing from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Udisha it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vitidalu.
Some sportspersons had their own season.
There is also a season for kite chewing.
We can express ourselves to the unique qualities that we have in ourselves when all the kites burst.
You must have seen that many children are very happy but they become very cheerful while playing.
They express themselves, the big ones who seem to be serious, the children who are hiding at the time of sports come out.
Traditional sports have been created in such a way that along with physical capabilities, our focus is on thinking, consciousness, awareness and awakening.
From children to Dadadi, Minority, when all come together, the people who are called Payya or Generation Gaps are snatched somewhere.
Many sports also awaken us about society, environment etc.
Today it is necessary that schools, shares, youth markets etc. come forward and promote these sports.
We can create an archive of our traditional sports by cross sourcing.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, our country will be officially celebrating World Environment Day celebrations.
This is an important achievement for India and this is the testimony of Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change.
The theme of this time is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to you all to ensure that we do not use polythene, liquid grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wildlife and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and a lot of suggestions have been given there in a very smooth manner, see, try and try to take them to their daily lives.
When there is a terrible heat, there is a flood, it does not take the name of stopping rains, if there is untimely cold, then every person talks about global warming, climate change, but what is the work done
In the last few weeks, we have seen that there has been plenty of rains in different parts of the country, heavy rains and heavy rains.
It was also a jewel, and it was a jewel.
All these things are basically the result of the changes in the climate.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and stay connected with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi addressed the gathering on the occasion.
When India played a key role in the Cop21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, it was a spirit of fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi in all its origins.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green.
How can we move forward in this direction
Can we become innovative
The fourth is to come. We can aim at the integrated tree plantation this time and not just planting trees but also to manage its conservation till it grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You must remember the 21st of June, not only you, but also the entire world remembers the 21st of June.
21st June is celebrated as International Yoga Day for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
Nowadays, there are reports that insistent preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day throughout the world.
Young for unity and hardware society is a message that the world has experienced in the past few years.
Yoga creates courage, which protects us like a saddle father.
A feeling of forgiveness arises as mothers are for their loved ones and mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
Bharatuhari has said that by doing regular yoga, the truth becomes our hungry, our saints and sisters, our self-confidence, our land becomes our bed and knowledge.
When all these qualities become friends, the Yogi gains victory over all kinds of dangers.
Once again I urge the countrymen to take forward our heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit ji.
This month's memories are linked to another thing and this is Veer Savarkar.
This was my month in 1985 when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were committed against injustice by showing their bravery.
Sadly, we have been calling the incidents of 185 for a very long time only a rebellion or a sepoy.
In fact, if this incident was seen as a calculation, it was not only true but it was also an attempt to push our self-respect.
He was a brave Savarkar who devoted himself to writing that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion, but the first fight for freedom.
The heroes of the Indian House of London, including Savarkar, celebrated their 50th anniversary.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the month when the freedom struggle started before independence.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of specialties
He was a passerby of both arms and science.
Generally, Veer Savarkar is known for his struggle against his brave and princely kingdom, but he was also an Ozvi poet and a social reformer, who always emphasized on solidarity and unity.
An extraordinary description of Savarkarji has been made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had portrayed so much.
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together.
He was also a brave revolutionary to be a sensitive poet.
Our daughters who were forced to ask for home from the garbage collection - today they are sewing the clothes to cover the poor by learning the sewerage work.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and confidence, for their bright future.
He has shown that if you are determined to do something then success can also be achieved between all the difficulties.
And that is not just a matter of sugar but you will get to see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at the problem then you will be able to see how people solve the problems.
You must have felt that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some people present here.
This discussion is also of politics, socialism, films, sports and sportspersons, problems of the country, such problems should be solved in such a way that most of these things remain confined to discussions only but some people are such that they move forward in the direction of bringing about changes in their work, hard work and relentlessly.
Shriman D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
Today, you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are living in the life of education.
He opened a school called 'Asha Ashwasan' for children living in huts, which spends 50 of their income for the poor tea sellers.
It provides education, health and food to all children coming to school.
I'm D.
I convey my best wishes to Prakash Rao for his hard work and for his new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He has tricked his life.
Who does not know this alphabet, but has shown it alive.
Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for the society and the entire nation.
You will also have a series of inspirational incidents around you.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Let us pursue positiveness.
In the month of June there is so much heat that people wait for rain and look towards the blue in the sky in the hope.
People will also wait for Chandni after a few days from today.
The meaning of seeing the moon is that Id can be considered.
Id's festival is a symbol of celebration after a month's fast during Ramzan.
I am confident that all the people will celebrate Id with full enthusiasm, especially children will get good ideas on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Id will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April, 2018
Recently, 21st Commonwealth Games were organized in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
1 countries of the world, including India, participated in it.
When such a big event is being organised, thousands of players from all over the world are participating in it, how can you imagine it
Whenever there is a desire to do something, zeal, enthusiasm, hopes and aspirations, who can keep it away from himself.
Our sportspersons also performed very well on the hopes of the countrymen and after winning a medal.
India has displayed a record whether it is shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton.
26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze India won about 66 medals.
This success brings pride to every Indian.
It is a matter of pride and happiness for the sportspersons.
It is a festival of great pride for all the countrymen.
Perhaps I will have less words to express this feeling.
But what I have heard from these players, I want to swallow you up.
It means that this time there were many things that happened for the first time.
Do you know that the number of wrestlers from India in the Commonwealth Games this time has come up by winning the medals
Manika Batra won a medal in all the events that Manika Batra had participated.
This is the first Indian woman who won India a gold medal in the individual table tennis.
India has the largest medals shooting.
The only Indian Para Power-lifter who won the medal in the Siachen Choudhary Commonwealth Games.
This time the games were special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting or shooting, women sportspersons have done a lot of hard work.
In the Badminton, the Final Competition was held by two Indian players, Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
Sindhu was there.
The athletes participating in the games came from different parts of the country, from small towns.
He also contributes to his friends who have maintained their share in every situation.
I convey my best wishes to all of them along with those players.
Last month, during Mann Ki Baat, I had called for Fit India with my countrymen, particularly with our youth and I invited everyone to join Fit India and lead Fit India.
A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsle has written in a swimming pool showing himself that My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written, I feel myself happily and healthy with the Morning walk.
And he adds that For me - Fitness cames with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that Happiness is a fitness.
Cine artist Akshay Kumar has put a video on Twitter.
Many other youngsters have shared their experiences by joining the Fit India efforts.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
The greatness of 21st June International Yoga Day has now been accepted by the whole world.
Prepare yourself now.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been told is now becoming very popular.
My young friends, now you will be getting out of the clutches of exams, exams and exams.
How to celebrate holidays, where to go
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to revive and experiencing smoke away from the computer.
My young friends, today I appeal to you for a special internship.
The three Ministries of Government of India, be it Sports, HRD or Drinking Water, have together launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Students from colleges, scholars, youngsters from NCC, youngsters of NSS, youngsters of Nehru Yuva Kendras who want to do something for the society, for the country and for the society, for the changes in the society, for the changes in the society, for the changes in the society, for the sake of connecting themselves, for the sake of doing something for the sake of doing something in the society, this is the opportunity for all. And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will get the opportunity to do something before and I will also tell you that those who have done good work in colleges will be rewarded at the national level.
Every intern who successfully completes this internship will be given a certificate by the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Moreover, the UGC will also provide two credit points to the interns who will complete it very well.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of it for the internship.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by visiting MyGov app.
I hope that our youth will further pursue this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
Your parents have sent messages, stories, photographs, video messages.
Let us make this holiday an opportunity to learn a new experience.
I have seen in the last few days that the youth of Delhi were talking about the selflessness of the poor children.
This campaign started from 15 children in huts near Gita Colleges in Delhi has now joined 22 thousand children in 12 locations of the capital.
The youngsters and teachers associated with this campaign are engaged in this effort of social transformation by taking a free time of 2 hours out of their daily routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers in the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
Their concerted efforts not only changed their fate but also in their respective fields.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly a crop of ragi, rajgra, makai or java.
Being a hilly area, farmers cannot get the right value.
However, instead of selling the crops directly into the market, they adopted the path of value addition and adopted a new path of value addition.
He started biscuits and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have created a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have also started a biscuit factory.
The system has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now being delivered to not only about 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kanyakumari.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has reached 10 to 15 lakh rupees but at the same time, more than 000 families are getting employment opportunities.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there is a need to fight against water in the world in the future.
Everyone speaks of this, but is it our responsibility or not
Do we not think that water conservation should be this social responsibility
For centuries our ancestors have shown this thing alive.
He has given priority to a drop of water.
He has discovered new measures to save one drop of water.
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management have been written in their big temples.
You will be able to see large artefacts everywhere in Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Puducherry.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must go to Jodhpur from Chand Bawa.
It is one of India's largest and most beautiful villages and it is worth noting that it is in the region where there is lack of water.
April, May, July, July is such a time that there is an excellent opportunity to collect rainwater and we get the benefits as much as we prepare in advance.
Manerega's budget is also used for water conservation.
During the last three years, everybody has made efforts in the direction of water conservation and water management.
Approximately 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management from the Manerega Budget every year.
55 of the total expenditure of Rs. 64 thousand crore i. e.
During the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted in accordance with water conservation and water management measures.
The budget received by the Government of India for water conservation and water management in Manerega has immensely benefitted some people.
Thousands of people working on the river Kuttumperur in Kerala have worked hard for 70 days and revived the river.
Ganga and Yamuna are water-filled rivers but there are some areas in Uttar Pradesh as two small rivers named Sasur Khadri of Fatehpur district have dried up.
The district system has undertaken a large number of soil and water conservation works under the Manerega.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, this fertile river revived the dry river.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture, villages, this is a success that is full of blessings.
I would like to say that once again, April, May, June, July, we should take up any responsibility for water conservation and we should make some schemes.
When there is Mann Ki Baat then I get messages from all sides, letters and phone calls from all sides.
Ayankar Banerjee of Devitola village in the north 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written in her comment on MyGov, we have celebrated Rabindra Jayanti every year, but many people do not know about the phenomenon of living with the Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore, beauty and integrity.
In the Mann Ki Baat programme, discuss this topic so that people can know about it.
I convey my heartfelt gratitude to Ayyanji that the focus of all the friends of Mann Ki Baat has been drawn towards this.
Gurudev Tagore was a person full of knowledge and wisdom, whose writing has left his mark on everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented personality, a multi-dimensional personality, but one of his inner teachers could feel every moment.
He has written in the lyrics, "He, who has the knowledge has the responsibilities to import it to the students.
I don't know Bengali language, but when I was young, I was very happy to be born - from childhood and from eastern India the radio starts soon.
When the delays start in western India, I guess in the morning, at about 5:30 a.m. Rabindra Music was started, on the radio and I had the habit of it.
I was very happy to hear Rabindra Music on the radio early in the morning. And when I got an opportunity to hear these poems, Aguner and Poroshmo, I got a sense of consciousness.
You must have been influenced by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay my respects to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramadan is celebrated with full faith and respect throughout the world.
The social aspect of Rosa is that when a person is hungry, he feels hungry for another.
When he himself is thirsty, he feels the thirst of the other.
This is an occasion to recall the teachings and messages of Paigambar Mohammad Saheb.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood from their lives.
Once a person asked Paigambar Saheb, what is the best thing in Islam
Paigambar Saheb said - feeding a poor and needy person and getting comfortable with everyone, whether you know him or not.
Paigambar Saheb believed in knowledge and compassion.
He was not arrogant.
He used to say that arrogance defeats knowledge.
Paigambar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have any goods more than required, then give it to a needy person, hence donations in Ramzan are also very important.
People offer gifts to the needy in this holy month.
Paigambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is purified by his soul, not by money and money.
We must be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcases the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, which has guided millions of people all over the world.
This Buddha Purnima, remembering Lord Buddha, trying to walk on his path, making a resolve and reminding us of the responsibility of all of us.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are the human values that are the highest in today's world.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar asserted that his social philosophy is inspired by Lord Buddha.
Baba Saheb has empowered millions of people who have been deprived of the Constitution, be it Dalits, oppressed, deprived or deprived.
There cannot be a bigger example of this.
This was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that the Buddhist monks used to travel across different countries, who had taken with them the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha, and it has been happening every time.
The teachings of Lord Buddha throughout Asia are inherited by us.
This tradition of Buddha is associated with us in many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar. And this is the reason that we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist Tourism, which connects important places of Southeast Asia to the special Buddhist sites of India.
I am also very happy that the Government of India is participating in the revival works of several Buddhist temples, including the centuries-old grand Anand Temple in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, there is a feeling of humiliation and human suffering, and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to humiliate the devotion.
I wish Buddha Purnima to all those who believe in the principles of compassion and faith in Lord Buddha spread all over the world.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the idols of Laughing Buddha, it is said that laughing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in Indias security history.
You would be wondering what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and the military power of India
You must be recalled that 20 years ago, on the evening of 11th May 18, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, addressed the nation and his thoughts filled the nation with pride, inspiration and happiness.
That day was Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 18th, there was a sustained examination in Pokhran, Rajasthan on the west side of India.
Indias test was successful and in a way, India showcased its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked in the history of India as an exhibition of its military power.
Lord Buddha has told the world that it is essential for the inner energy, the strength of the integrity and peace.
Similarly, when you are strong in the form of a nation, you can be peaceful with you all.
The month of May, 18 is not only important for the country but it is important to have a thorough test done in this month.
He showed the entire world that India's land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can gain momentum and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave a mantra - Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
We will also be able to achieve a new joy and a new satisfaction to take forward the journey that Atal ji had launched.
My dear countrymen, once again we will meet in Mann Ki Baat, we will talk more.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the sacred festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
We have seen the power of Ram Naam in the life of Bapu every moment in his life.
In the past, on 26 January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were present here, they had come up with a cultural troop and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting Ramayana in front of us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are producing so much inspiration and influence in not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of the world.
I once again wish you all the best of Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have met all your letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
I read what Kamal Thakkarji wrote about the launch of the online course of Sanskrit on MyGov.
It was a great pleasure to see your love for Sanskrit with IT professionalism.
I have asked the concerned department to send information about the efforts being made to you.
I will also request the recipients of Mann Ki Baat to consider what can be done in terms of information of Kamal ji.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Baraker, District Nalanda, Bihar, you read comments on NarendraModiApp.
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the land is very important in chocolate.
Shri Mangal Shastri Ji, Karnataka.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for the animals in the summer season.
Canal ji, I have brought your feelings to all the devotees.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that I talk to the youth about their health this time.
They feel that if we compare Asian countries then our youth is physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time we should talk to everyone in detail about health- Fit India.
And you can also run a Fit India movement with all the youngsters.
In the past, the Prime Minister of France visited Kashi and Shriman Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the visions of this journey were to be touched and influenced.
He urged them to propagate all the testimonies, all video social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had put that statement on social media and Narendra ModiApp on that day.
Now you lick them and retweet them and send them to your friends.
He has written to me about the gratitude cards given by Andha, Jayesh and many children from Chennai to Exam Warrior books.
Andha, Jayesh, I would like to tell you all the children that these letters of yours have made me feel tired all day long.
All such letters, all such phone calls, comments, whatever I could read from them, and many of these things have touched my mind, but perhaps I have to say something continuously for months.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about the examination.
He has said his scheme about the holidays.
In the summer heat, water is worried for the animals.
Farmer brothers and sisters have received letters regarding Kisan Melas and farming activities across the country.
Some active citizens have sent information regarding water conservation.
Our festivals, our cultures and our traditions are discussed during the festivals.
That is, our mindset also changes with the seasons and perhaps it is also true that our mindset changes the weather of life of somebody else.
And why not
In your thoughts, in your experiences, in your examples, all these inspirations, so much energy, so much self-confidence, so much for the country.
He has the power to change the weather of the entire country.
When I get to read in your letters how Ahmedabad Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj in Assam, has built new schools for the poor children by his will, then this country has an unprecedented will.
In this mission, Sadul sold the households and made the money collected by the donors.
Several pilgrims who travelled in his cab were blessed with generosity.
An engineer daughter gave her first step
In this way, after 12 years of collection of rupees, the Saddle Laskar brought the color and today due to his immense hard work, due to his immense hard work, about 30 bedded hospitals have been constructed in the revived village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of a New India.
Today, the vision of India has changed all over the world.
Today, in the entire country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the middle class, in every section of the country, the belief is that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
A positive atmosphere of confidence filled with hopes and aspirations has been created.
This self-confidence, this positiveness will fulfil our resolve of a New India.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months, it is very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
That is why many letters have come in terms of agriculture.
This time, I also visited DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan with a video of the discussions with farmers and I feel that every farmer should connect with this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and should look at the experiments in his fields.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, everyone regarded agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and general public life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji stressed on the need for conservation of plants, trees and vegetation and larger farming.
Ramanohar Lohia had spoken of massive publicity for our farmers, for ensuring greater income, extension of irrigation facilities and for enhancing food and milk production.
In his speech in 1991, Chaudhari Charan Singhji urged farmers to use new technologies and innovation.
I had gone to the Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi in the last few days.
My interaction with the farmers and scientists there was a pleasant experience for me to know, understand and know about the innovations related to agriculture. But what I had most influenced was the hard work of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This low-cost state has shown a lot of work.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record production during 2015-16 as compared to last five years.
He has shown that when the goal is determined, there is uncertainty, and if there is a resolve in mind, it can be proved and shown.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is getting the support of tokenology, which is giving a lot of strength to the agricultural producers.
In the letters that I have received, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the spirit of technology and they wanted me to talk to them in the area.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide proper prices to the farmers.
It has been decided that the price of technology for appropriate crops will be announced at least one and a half times of their expenditure.
Efforts are being made to connect the local bodies of the villages with the Wholesale Market and then with the Global Market.
Farmers will not have to go far enough to sell their produce so that 22,000 rural haats of the country will be connected with the APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading them with the necessary intermediaries.
This means that in a way, a direct linkage of any market of the country with the fields is being made.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve, how can we pay our best tributes to Gandhiji by achieving the aspirations of crores of Indians
How can new activities be valued for this
I request you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What is the flag of Gandhi 150
You should inform you about the kind of slogan or mantra or fraud.
All of us together have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him and bring our country to new heights.
I believe that both Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a strong approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health only. Now all the Departments and Ministries, Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Women and Child Development are working together for a healthy India.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we become aware of the preventive healthcare, the more it benefits the person, the family and the society.
For a healthy life, cleanliness is the first requirement.
All of us have taken the beads in the form of a country and the result was that in the last four years, sanitation coverage has doubled to almost 80.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level in the direction of creating health wellness centres across the country.
This is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a collective movement today, has reached home.
This time the International Day of Yoga - 21st June has saved less than 100 days.
On the last three International Yoga Days, people from all parts of the country and the world participated in a lot of enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, all for Yoga.
In a new way, Yoga has to be popularized in children, youth, adults, in all age groups, men or women.
Although the country's TV and electronic media do different programmes in terms of Yoga during the year, but can we create awareness about Yoga in the form of a campaign from today to day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I need yoga practitioners, but some people have made me Yoga teachers through their creativity and have created 3D Animated Video by doing Yoga.
I will share that video with all of you so that we can study asanas and pranayama together.
Efforts are also being made at a comprehensive level to ensure that health care is within reach and nutrition is available to the common man.
Heart stent prices have been reduced by 85 for heart patients.
The number of MBBS seats in the four medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS is being set up in different states to provide better treatment and health facilities to people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
All of us will see collective efforts to get rid of B.
Years ago Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
The industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when the Make in India campaign in the country is successfully running, Dr.
Today, the vision of Ambedkar ji had dreamt of India as an industrial state is an inspiration for us.
Today, India has emerged as a vibrant point in the global economy and today the world's largest foreign direct investment FDI is coming to India.
The entire world is seeing India as a hub for capital, innovation and development.
The development of industries will be possible only in cities, he added.
Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on the urbanization of India.
He did not want any person to live his life in poverty.
In addition to this, he also believed that poverty cannot be overcome by sharing only something among the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
Babasaheb Ambedkar talked about the ports and waterways in the decades of 130 and 140 when only roads and railways were talked about in India.
He is Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw the water power as the nation's power.
He emphasized on the use of water for the development of the country, various river valley authorities, various water related commissions - all this was the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being constructed at various coasts of India and inter-states are being strengthened at old ports.
During the decade of 40s, most of the discussions took place in the context of the Second World War, the Created Storm War and the Storm.
Ambedkar had laid the foundation stone of Team India Spirit in a way.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism, and stressed on working together with the Centre and the States for the cause of the nation.
Today, in every aspect of governance, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism, and the most important thing is that Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that it is not necessary for us to move forward that there is a great or immortal family, but those who are born in the poor families of India can also dream of, try to fulfill their dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it has also been created that a lot of people have visited Dr.
We have made every possible effort to ensure that the children of poor and backward families cannot move forward, nothing can happen and nothing can be achieved in their lives.
But the testimony of a New India is totally different.
One such India belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward.
Under this, there will be separate programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I urge you to participate in this campaign enthusiastically.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals to be held in the next few days: Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
The day of Lord Mahavir's Jayanti is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The vision of Lord Mahavir Ji, the messenger of Ahimsa, will inspire all of us.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
On the eve of Easter's discussion, the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus Christ reminded him of peace, goodwill, justice, compassion and compassion.
If we celebrate the festival of Vaisakhi in Punjab and West India in April, then in these days, Judashital and Satvain in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will be very happy and miserable.
All these festivals are linked to our farming and food grains in some way, through these festivals, we thank the nature for the priceless climate that we have produced.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
My dear countrymen, today Nalanda is launching Mann Ki Baat from a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science.
We have seen that the colour of the sea is blue, but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought that whether the river or the sea, why the water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the decade of 120.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
Raman's name comes before us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for excellent work on light screening.
One of his discoveries is known as 'Roman Effect'.
We observe National Science Day on 28th February every year as it is said that on this day there was a discovery of the event of light skating, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great scholar Bodhain, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhatt on the other hand, while on the other hand there is a sustainable and glorious pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose, from Sar Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana are proud of India.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the famous particle Boson was also named.
Recently, I got the opportunity to be present in a Mumbai programme for the inauguration of Wadhwan Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science.
This technique can be used to improve the lives of the poor, the underprivileged or the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I urged the scientific community to help in facilitating the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can artificial intelligence help in making health services accessible and modernizing diseases
A few days ago, along with the Israeli Prime Minister, I had the opportunity to visit the inauguration of the 'I Create' in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There, a young man has developed a digital instrument that if anyone cannot speak, he is in a dialogue with his writings through instruments and can interact in the same way as a person who can speak.
I believe that we can use artificial intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology are valuable coastal.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do as we want.
However, it depends on us what we want to do with machines.
Human emergence becomes important here.
Use of science for the welfare of mankind, to scale up the highest heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered light bulbs, has been unsuccessful in his experiments several times.
It is a coincidence that today I am in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Arabics.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
In this way, he questioned every aspect of his life as a great saint.
Find answers and wait for humans.
The feeling of asking questions again and again is important to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my greetings to all our scientists and scientists.
My best wishes to our younger generation, to be inspired to discover truth and knowledge and to serve society with the help of science.
Friends, During the time of crisis, I have been receiving many messages related to all these subjects, people keep writing differently.
From Pune, Shriman Ravindra Singh has spoken on the subject of Occupational Safety in his comment on the Narendra Modi mobile app.
He has written that safety parameters on factory and construction sites in our country are not so good.
On 4th March, Indias National Safety Day, the Prime Minister spoke of peace in his Mann Ki Baat programme, which will increase awareness among the people.
When we talk about democracy, two things are very important - one proactiveness and the other prioritizedness.
Satisfaction is of two types - one that is essential at present, safety during distortion and the other that is required in daily life, safety in on-the-service life.
If we are not aware of satisfaction in daily life, we cannot achieve it then it becomes difficult to digest during hospitals.
We have often read a board on the roads, it has been written that do not leave the world at a rapid pace of accidents, accidents, accidents, accidents, joyful misconceptions, do not leave the world untouched by the security forces, do not make any effort to save the lives of the people, the lives of the workers are not very useful in our life.
If we remain alert and follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives, but we can also awaken the society with great strides.
Sometimes we have seen that there is a lot of letters written by taking salute at the workplace but whenever you want, it does not seem to be followed.
I would like to urge the municipalities, municipalities who have fire brigade, to go to different schools once a week or once a month to drive the children of schools.
There will be two benefits - Fair Brigade will also be habituated to be cautious and the new generation also gets its teachings and there is no different cost for it - in a way a course of teaching remains and I always urge this thing.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the country's property management.
Apada Mitra has also been initiated for training of volunteers in flood and cyclone hazardous districts.
Training and awareness play a very important role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to hi-heatwave.
After this, organised workshops to prevent NDMAHW and launched a campaign to bring awareness among the people.
A good result has come out with the participation of all.
The death toll in 2017 was surprisingly reduced to around 2020.
It can be known that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people working in the society, be it social organisation, be it aware citizens, I want to make everybody proud of those who are rich in relief and rescue work within the mines.
And the number of such crime heroes is not less.
A Joint Disaster Management Exercise of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal was also conducted. It was a first and great human experiment in itself.
We have to become a risk conscience society.
In our culture, we always talk about the safety of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of value of safety.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
This means that what was the arrangement of providing information
Because we are not aware of nature and for this our ears are heard after sitting in the air but none of us feel like this is for me.
The same experience is in every sphere of our life.
We should not think that safety is for anybody else, if we all become a punishment for our sake, then the feeling of sanitation of the society is also incorporated in itself.
The objective of this Gobardhan scheme is to make the villages clean and generate wealth and energy by converting the waste of cattle and farm waste into compost and bio gas.
Some European countries and China, cattle dung and other bio-disciplinary was used for energy manufacturing but its full potential was not being used in India.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural, we are moving forward in this direction.
The goal of utilising the waste of Dhoor, waste from agriculture, waste from kitchen, all of them to make biogas-based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers will be encouraged in rural India not only as waste but also as source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas.
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase.
The biogas will increase self-reliance in energy matters for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and animal husbandry will be able to increase their income.
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will also be created for the smooth management of the Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers can get the right price for Gobar and Agriculture Waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by forming a self-help group.
I invite you to become a partner in this movement of clean energy and green jobs, to convert waste into wealth in your village and to make it smooth.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about muscle festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh wherein the first Kachhara Mahotsav was organized in the state.
The objective behind this festival organised by the Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about the different ways of creating the waste of the city and reuse of the garbage.
During this festival, several activities took place in which all the students and elderly people participated.
Different types of wastes were made using waste.
A workshop was organised to educate people on all aspects of waste management.
There was a music performance on the theme of cleanliness and aart work was made.
Inspired by Raipur, different types of waste festivals took place in other districts too.
Innovative ideas, discussions and poetry were reading.
A festive atmosphere has been created in the context of cleanliness.
The manner in which school children participated with enthusiasm was amazing.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovation of the importance of waste management and cleanliness in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are several programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, the Shakti Puraskar in the country also commemorates those women who have worked in different fields in the past.
I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda on this occasion.
It is our commitment to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life today.
We are a part of the tradition where men were identified with women, Yashodanandan, Kaushalyandan, Gandhariputra, this was the identity of a son.
Today, our Nari Shakti has introduced self-confidence and self-confidence with its actions.
He has not only stepped forward, but also worked to take the country and the society forward and take it to a new chapter.
This is the dream of our New India where the daughters are strong and strong, equal partners in the entire development of the country.
In the last few days, a very beautiful suggestion was made to me by a great saint.
He suggested that on 8th March there are several programmes to celebrate 'Mahila Diwas'. Can the honour of the honoured mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village
And this can be a long time talk about it. I think it is better to reach you.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women and 15 lakh women have joined the Swachhta Abhiyan.
Starting from 26th January, 2018, under this mission, these women have created a new example by constructing 1 lakh 0,000 toilets in just 20 days.
Can you imagine how big these events are
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will transform the movement of cleanliness in the normal life and the culture of cleanliness into the common mans nature.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in New ealand that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You all are well aware that Elephanta island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and such a huge tourist destination, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years since independence.
For 70 years, the three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morabandar and Sethbandar, have now become very simple and their lives have become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will now be published through electricity.
This is not just electricity but also a new beginning of development.
Whether the lives of the countrymen are illuminated or happy in their lives, what else can be the moment of happiness and happiness
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now this month is the specialty of this month. The month of March is the golden emergence of the fields decorated with rice, the golden emergence of joyful wheat and the splendour of the joyful monkey.
But this month's Holi festival is also very much liked by all of us.
On March 2, the entire country will celebrate Holi with fervor.
The importance of Holi is as important as Holika Dahan as it is a day to destroy the evils by burning them in fire.
Holi is auspicious opportunity to forget and sit together, participate in each other's happiness and happiness and gives message of love unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and colourful greetings to all my countrymen on the occasion of Holi.
This festival will be filled with colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat of 2018 and just two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history it was such that the leaders of 10 countries were present at the event.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the NarendraModiApp and has urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written that it is the legend of Chawla that is being held in the space on 1st February.
He left us in the Kalambia Space Campaign but inspired millions of youngsters from all over the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has started his long letter with the leave of Anupriya Chawla.
It is a matter of sadness for all that we have lost the imagination of Chawla in such a young age, but he has given a message to thousands of youngsters from all over the world, especially India, that there is no limit to the Nari Shakti.
If there is a desire and a strong resolve to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that today women are moving forward in every sector in India and the pride of the country is increasing.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place and their contribution to the society has been absorbing the entire world.
There has been a long tradition of Indian enemies.
Many of India's adversaries have been contributing to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi, there are many names.
Today, we talk about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but centuries ago, in our sciences, Scandal Puran, it has been said: "Dashputra Samakanya, Dashuputran Pravardhan.
The more wealth it receives from ten daughters, the more we get from a daughter.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of "power".
This Nari Shakti binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and the society in the direction of unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given several examples.
He has written that it is an inspiration for our Armed Defence Prime Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to fly in the LTTE 'Sukhoi 30'.
Under the leadership of Varika Joshi, the Indian Navy's women Crew Members is circumnavigating the entire world on the INSV television.
Three brave women have become emotional knot, mahana lion and Avni Chaturvedi fighter pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30.
Under the leadership of Capacity Vajpayee, the All Women Crew has floated from Delhi to San Francisco and Part Delhi in the Air India Boeing jet and all the ladies.
In the past, Hon'ble President made a new initiative.
The President visited a group of extraordinary women who had shown something first in the field of shipping.
This is the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach the Everest, the first woman train driver of the passenger train, the first female fitter, the first female bus driver of the country, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach the Everest.
Our Nari Shaktis have achieved extraordinary achievements by breaking the rivalry of society.
He pointed out that a new path can be created by crossing all the obstacles and barriers on the strength of hard work, determination and determination.
A path that will not only inspire the people of their times but will also inspire generations.
He will be filled with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book has also been prepared on the insurance secretary, first ladies so that the entire country can know about these dramatic forces, inspire them from their lives and their works.
It is also an e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, the country's women power has an important role in the positive transformation in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you will be wondering what is the relationship between these two
Mumbai's Matunga station is India's first station with all women employees.
In all the departments, be it insurance staff or be it commercial department, be it railway police, ticket checker, industrialist or point prince, the staff of more than 40 employees belongs to women.
This time, many people have written on Twitter and on other social media after witnessing the Republic Day Parade that one of the main things of the Parade was the BSF Biker Continent in which all the women were participating.
He was experiencing courageous experiments and this philosophy was also surprised by the visitors from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our dynasty is leading the nation.
When it comes to tribal women, a certain testimony comes to everyones mind, where there are forests, legends, ladies and gentlemen walking on their heads.
However, our tribal daughter of Chhattisgarh has made a new testimony to the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected region, has created a catastrophic environment for violence, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such dangerous areas by driving e-rickshaws.
In a short span of time, a lot of women have joined it.
On the one hand, while self-employment has empowered them, on the other hand, the testimony of the Maoist-affected region is changing.
And it is also strengthening the work of environment conservation.
Continuous efforts have been made at the individual and social level in our country for centuries against social evils and evils.
A few days ago, Bihar made a unique initiative.
The world's longest human chain of over 13,000 kms was built to eradicate social evils in the state.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of the evils of childhood and sex practices.
The entire state took a pledge to fight with the daughters like Dahej and Child Marriage.
Young people, mothers and sisters, who are full of zeal and zeal, all of them participated in this juncture.
The human chain, which began from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, continued to connect unprecedentedly to the borders of the state.
It is important that our society should be free from these evils so that all the people of the society get the benefit of development in the true sense.
Let us collectively take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and build a New India, a powerful and supportive India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration of the state and every person involved in the human chain who made such a special and comprehensive initiative in the direction of social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov - on the treatment of his father, the cost of medicines was Rs. 6000 per month.
Earlier, he did not know about the Prime Minister Janaushadhi Kendra.
But now when they got information about Jan Aushadhi Kendras and they bought medicines from there, the cost of their medicines decreased by 5.
He wished that I should talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that the maximum number of people can know about it and take advantage of it.
For the past few years, many people used to write and tell me about it.
I have also visited the video and social media of several people who have taken advantage of this scheme.
And when I get this kind of information then I feel very happy.
There is a deep satisfaction.
And I also felt very good that Shriman Darshan ji had thought that what he had received was also given to others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make Health Care Affordable and promote Ease of Living.
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper by about 50 to 0 from the branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the masses, particularly the senior citizens who take medicines every day, a lot.
The generic medicines sold in these are as per the standards of World Health Organisation.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available in affordable manner.
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides cheap medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for the Industrial Entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are prevalent on Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and hospitals' Amrit Stores.
The only objective behind all this is to make the poorest of the country a healthy and prosperous India so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mange from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the mobile app.
This photo was such that my attention was drawn towards those photographs.
The photograph was such that a grandson was participating in the cleaning campaign of Clean Moon River along with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the river Muruna under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river of Mora had flown for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal.
Another pain is that the river was completely filled with wild buffaloes.
However waste was being harvested on the river and its banks.
A Action Plan was prepared and one day before Makar Sankranti, on 13th January, under the first phase of Mission Clean Moon, two shores of river Moon were cleaned at four quarters of the area.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this work of Mission Clean Moon.
The Swachhata programme was also organised in a similar manner on 20th January, 2018 and I was told that this campaign will run every Saturday morning till the river of Mora is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then there is nothing impossible.
A massive change can be brought about through Jan Andolan.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and municipal administration and every citizen engaged in making this work a mass movement and this effort will inspire others of the country.
My dear countrymen, you will be listening to a lot of discussions on Padma awards these days.
Even in the newspapers, attention is being drawn on TV on this subject.
But if you look closely then you will be proud of the fact that the great people are amongst us and it will naturally be proud of how today the common man in our country is reaching these heights without any emotions.
There has been a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year, but its entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
Transparency has come due to online process.
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been completely transformed.
Now the significance of the award is increasing, not the identity of the person but the importance of his work is increasing.
You will be happy to know that Aurobindo ji, a student from IIT Kanpur, has dedicated his entire life to making sports for children.
They are making silk from four to ten wastes so that the livelihood of science in children can increase.
Their efforts are to inspire children from waste material to scientific experiments, for which they go to three thousand schools across the country and showcase 18 languages and inspire children.
What a wonderful life, a wonderful dedication.
One such thing is that of Karnataka's Sitawa Jodity.
The goddess of women empowerment is not the same.
In the last three decades, he has contributed greatly to changing the lives of countless women.
He had dedicated himself as a Goddess at the age of seven, but he put his whole life for the welfare of the Goddesses.
Not only this, he has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in an extremely poor family and tribal family.
He did a simple job for life, but he was sorry to make traditional tribal pictures.
Today, due to his grief, he is honoured not only in India but in the whole world.
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who naming India abroad, was recognized and honored with Padma Shri.
You will be happy to hear about Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutti.
Laxmikutti is a teacher in Kallar and is still in a hut made of cardamom leaves in tribal areas between dense forests.
He has made five hundred pillars of medicine based on his memories.
He added that he has been able to manufacture medicines for use after snake bite.
Laxmiji is continuously serving the society with his knowledge of medicines.
He was honored with Padma Shri for his contribution to the society by recognising this blameless person.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils and vegetables in other households to build a hospital.
When he was 23, his father died due to lack of treatment and inspired him to make a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in their hard work hospitals.
I am very confident that there are many such monsters and daughters in our multi-purpose settlement whom no one knows or knows.
The Padma awards are a medium but I will also tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who live around us for the society, who are dedicated to the society, who work with someone else, sometimes they should be brought among the society.
He does not work for dignity, but his work inspires us.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, people should listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, some efforts should be made in the society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is 9th January when the revered Mahatma Gandhi had returned to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between India and the Indians living around the world.
This year, we organized a programme on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas inviting all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin living around the world.
You will be happy to know that in this programme, from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States and many other countries where our original Indian Mayor is there, where the original Indian Parliamentarians participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries, but also have a strong relationship with India.
Our original Indians, who live in different countries of Europe, are working in a cyber security, who are dedicated to Ayurveda, who donates to the minds of the society through their music or by their poems.
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, for the RECOGNISE of the people of Indian origin and to inform the people of the world through them.
On 30th January, the legend of venerable Bapu, who has shown us a new path.
At present, we must take every step as to how true Bapu's thoughts were.
If we make a pledge to walk on the path of Bapu, what can be a greater tribute
My dear countrymen, along with conveying my best wishes to you all on the occasion of 2018, I salute my speech.
Mann Ki Baat December 2017
This is the last event of Mann Ki Baat this year and coincidence is also the last day of 2019.
We have shared a lot of things this year.
Many of your letters, comments and exchange of ideas for Mann Ki Baat always brings a new energy for me.
The year will change after a few hours, but this series of our thoughts will continue in the same way.
We will do more innovative things in the coming year, sharing new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Recently, on 25th December, the Festival of Freedom all over the world has been celebrated with fervor.
In India too, people celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, all of us recall the great teachings of Christ and Isha Masih, the most emphasis on this thing - Sevabhav.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh jis courageous and extraordinary life is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and lived his life on the basis of these values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, inspired people in all these roles.
He fought against oppression and injustice.
People have been advised to break the bonds of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he also had to lose a lot individually.
But he never gave place to the spirit of devoutness.
The message of love, sacrifice and peace in every moment of his life was his personality filled with so many great features.
Let us take all our pledges and seek inspiration from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his inspirational life and strive to fulfil his life.
Those who were born in or after the year 2000 will become eligible voters from January 1, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century as New India voters.
I congratulate our youth and urge all of you to register as your voter.
The entire Indian is eager to welcome you as a voter of the 21st century.
You will also be proud to be the voters of the 21st century.
Your vote will become the basis of a New India.
The power of vote is the biggest strength in the democracy.
Mat is the most effective tool for bringing about a positive change in the lives of lakhs of people.
You can also become India's builder of the 21st century and it has been started in a special way since January 1.
And today, in my Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to our warriors full of energy and resolutions of 18-25 years.
I am confident that the skills and strength of our energetic youth will fulfil our dream of a New India.
When we talk of a New India, a New India which is free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Free of dirt and poverty.
New India, where there is equal opportunity for all, where the hopes and aspirations of all are fulfilled.
New India should be our inspiration for peace, unity and harmony.
My New India Youth will come forward and summon how it will be a New India.
He will also set a path for himself, along with him, to connect those who are associated with him and keep moving forward.
You too should move forward, the country too will move forward.
When I am talking to you today, I got an idea whether we can organize a Mock Parliament in every district of India.
Where the youth from 18 to 25 years of age will sit together and organise a New India, find ways and plans.
How can we achieve our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters had dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for the grand and grand India of the 21st century.
How to achieve success by resolution
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
Our youth are coming forward from skill development to innovation and interpretation.
I would like to know about all these opportunities in a way how this New India Youth gets a place and a system should be created in this regard so that they can easily get information about this world and get the necessary benefits as soon as they are 18 years old.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, I talked about the importance of positiveness.
I am reminded of a shloka of Sanskrit. It means that a person full of zeal is extremely strong because nothing can be done with enthusiasm.
Nothing is impossible for a positive and enthusiastic person.
People in English also say - Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
I had appealed to the countrymen in Mann Ki Baat to tell your positive moments of 2019 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am very happy that a large number of people gave a very positive response to the social media platform, MyGov and the NarendraModi App.
With the Positive India Hashteg (PIH), lakhs of tweets reached more than 1.
In a way, the communication of positiveness that took place in India spread all over the world.
The tweets and impressions that came were really inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some of the countrymen have shared this year's programmes that had a special impact on their minds.
Some people also shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I will be staying in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra.
I talk to the bodle.
Our insurance covered a premium of one rupee per month.
She was made by my father and passed away in one of his accidents.
We should know what was the situation at that time.
With this help of the government, we have benefited a lot and I can hold a few meetings.
My name is satisfaction.
Our village has crossed the National Highway from Bhinnar village since 2017.
This will improve our roads and increase trade.
My name is Dipnshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Sahasanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewan.
There was a problem of water in our region and for 40 years we had to depend on the pipeline of Armi.
Now this pipeline has become independent.
So all these major achievements are in our year 2017.
There are many people who are doing such things at their own level, which are bringing about a positive change in the lives of many people.
Indeed, this is the New India that we are building together.
Let us enter the new year with the happiness of these small ones, start the new year and take strong steps in the direction of Progressive India from Positive India.
When we talk of positivity then I also feel like sharing one thing.
Recently, I got to know about the inspiration of Anjum Bashir Khan Bhattak, the topper of administrative service in Kashmir.
He has taken the first step in the examination of the Kashmir Administrative Service, out of the clutches of terrorism and despair.
You will be surprised to know that in 10 the terrorists had burnt their native house.
There was so much terrorism and violence that their families had to leave their homeland.
For a small child, all the violence around it was enough to create blindness and bitterness in the heart, but the fig did not happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of service to the people.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
The Anjumu has proved that no matter how bad the situation may be, the blue of depression can also be written through positive actions.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
And when I was listening to them, they want to progress in what field of life.
The time I spent with these daughters, I also got inspiration and this is the strength of the country. This is my youth. This is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk of the world's famous religious places, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
In this world famous temple, devotees of crores come here every year to take blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami.
Where there are such large number of devotees, the place where there is such a great importance, how big is the challenge to maintain cleanliness
And in particular, the place between mountains and jungles.
But the Sabarimala Temple itself is an example of how this problem can be transformed into a culture, how to find a way out of the problem and how the peoples participation has so much strength.
P.
A Police Officer named Vijayan launched a programme Puneyam Punakvanam and launched a voluntary campaign of awareness for cleanliness under the programme.
And it has created a tradition that the journey of travellers will not be completed until they do not perform any physical work in the programme of cleanliness.
There is no bigger or smaller in this campaign.
Every traveller knows how much time he works for cleanliness, works for filth, works for filth.
Everyday in the morning the scene of cleanliness is very unique and all the pilgrims get involved in it.
Why not a big CELEBRITY, however a wealthy person, however a large officer, every person becomes a part of this programme of 'Punyama rehabilitation' like an ordinary traveler.
We have many such examples for our countrymen.
The Swachhata Abhiyan in Sabarimala and the Poonam Rejuvenation in it become a part of the journey of every traveler.
There is also a strong resolve of cleanliness along with the floods.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, on the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, we all have resolved that the incomplete work of venerated Bapu is a Swachh Bharat, an India free from evil.
Pujya Bapu continued to strive for this work for the rest of his life.
And we all decided that when Bapu was 150th birth anniversary, we should do something in the direction of giving him a clean India of his dreams.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
In rural and urban areas, people-to-people participation is also changing.
The worlds largest survey - Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the availability of sanitation in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than four thousand cities in a population of about 40 crore.
The challenges that will be examined in this survey, free from open defecation in cities, collection of waste, transportation system for lifting waste, scientifically processing of waste, efforts made for behavioural change, capacity building and innovative efforts made for cleanliness and public participation for this work.
During this survey, different teams will go and inspection the cities.
He will interact with citizens and respond to them.
The Swachhta App will be used and analysis of various types of services.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities that will make the cleanliness of the city a people's habit and become the nature of the city.
Cleanliness should not be done by the government alone.
Every citizen and civil society is also very responsible.
And I appeal to every citizen to participate in the Swachhta Survekshan in the days to come.
And don't leave your city behind, don't be behind your streets.
I am confident that the use of green and blue waste by separating dry waste and wet waste from home has become your habit.
During the Swachhta Survekshan from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, you should not be left behind in this healthy competitiveness of cleanliness - it should be a matter of public discussion in every city.
And you must have a dream of a city - our endeavour, immense progress of the country.
With this resolve, let us once again remember the venerable Bapu and take the pledge of a Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that are very small to see, but as a society, our identity is far-flung.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
One thing is that if a Muslim woman wants to go for Haj pilgrimage, she cannot go without 'Maharam' or her male guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time then I thought how can this be so
Who would have made such rules
Why such a difference
And when I was in deep depths then I was distressed - even after 70 years of independence, we were the people who had such a restaurant.
For decades Muslim women were being treated as injustice but there was no discussion.
Even in many Islamic countries, this rule is not there.
But Muslim women did not get this right in India.
And I am happy that our government has focused on this thing.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has also taken necessary steps and we have defeated this restaurant by abolishing the tradition that has been going on for 70 years.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without Mehram and I am glad that around 1300 Muslim women have applied to go to Haj this time and women from different parts of the country - from Kerala to North have expressed their desire to travel Haj pilgrimage.
I am confident and I firmly believe that the journey of India's development, the strength of our women power and their talent will continue to move forward.
It should be our constant endeavour that our women also get equal rights of men and equal opportunities so that they can move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
On the Republic Day, there will be not one but ten chief guests this time.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2017 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians that these great leaders of the 10 countries of the world will be present on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, even though our country is a country of festivals in a way.
Perhaps there will be a day in which no festival has been written.
Now we all have celebrated Christmas and are going to come a new year.
The next New Year brings a lot of happiness, happiness and prosperity for all of you.
Let us all move forward with new vision, new zeal, new zeal and new resolve.
The month of January is the period of the sunrise and it is celebrated in this month as Makar Sankranti.
If there is a lot of joy in Punjab and Northern India, then there is a wait for sweet and sweet revolution in UP-Bihar.
Sankrit said in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, these festivals are special in themselves and they have their own importance.
Each festival is celebrated from 13th to 1st January.
The names of these festivals are different, but their original form is the same - connecting with nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to every countrymen on these festivals.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my countrymen.
I will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
It was such a conversation that speaks with a lot of talent, younger brothers and sisters.
Listen to how in this phase of Ayusha, Lata Didi is eager for all the things related to the country and the satisfaction of life is also in India's progress, changing India, touching new heights.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam
I am speaking Narendra Modi.
Lata Didi: Pranam.
Modiji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday...
When will you go and turn around
Modi ji: I will come back on 28th late at night and on 2nd at dawn and then your birthday will have passed.
Lataji: There are a lot of people in the age group, but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those who are bigger than their work.
Modi ji: Dadi, you are very old in your age and you are also very old in your work and the achievements that you have achieved have been achieved through tools and penance.
Lataji: Yes, I think my parents have blessings and blessings of the devotees.
I am nothing.
Modi ji: Yes, today is your humility, it is a great education for all of our new generations.
It is a great inspiration for us that even after clearing all these things in our lives, your parents' culture and that humility have always been given priority.
Lataji: Yes.
Modi ji: And I am happy that when you proudly say that your mother was Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you, he said, Give me something Gujarati.
I know that the image of India is changing due to your arrival and I am very happy with that.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see how hard you are and how much work you have.
What do we have to think
When you visited your mother's feet, I had sent somebody to her and took her blessings.
Modiji: Yes.
My father was very happy because of your love.
Modi ji: But there was so much time that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will come very soon.
It will be my privilege.
Modi ji: Pranam Didi.
Your Excellency, Lataji.
Modi ji: Pranam ji
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal, new energy, new zeal and new resolve.
Festivals are auspicious.
Festivals will continue throughout the country till the next few weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps this is not just a word, it is a mandate, a vision, an inspiration for all of us.
Some households have sweets and some households have sweets for sweets.
This is what Diu is spreading on the floor.
The real joy of these festivals is when this light is light, this light is lightening.
We also share happiness where there is no shortage and it also becomes our nature.
In our homes, we should also think of providing sweets, clothes and gifts to each other for a moment.
Shortly, the more we have in our homes, the more we don't work, the more we share these things in others.
In many cities, the start-ups of young friends of several NGs are doing such a thing.
He collects clothes, sweets, spices, jewellery, everything from the households of the people and discovers the needy and leads them to Guptchup.
Can this time, with full awareness and determination in this festival of festivals, can this divine solid waste
You will double your happiness on the memorable and festivals of many poor families. Your face will be shining.
Your dialects will become even more illuminated and your heart will grow even more.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi ji's house comes home in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
Traditionally Laxmi ji is welcome.
Can we keep programmes of honour in our society, villages, cities and daughters
Can we keep public programmes
There will be many daughters among us who have been raising the name of the family, the society and the country with their hard work and talent.
Can we make a programme to honour India's Laxmi on this occasion
Several daughters and daughters around us must have been doing extraordinary work.
If someone is engaged in spreading awareness about hygiene and health, then a doctor will be serving the society as an engineer.
Being a lawyer, he must be trying to bring justice to anyone.
Our society should recognize, honour and take pride in these daughters.
His honourable programmes will be held across the country.
The promotion of Laxmi of India means to pave the way for the prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that one of the biggest benefits of Mann Ki Baat is that I get the privilege of interacting directly with many well-known people.
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when the result of my examination came, some people asked me whether he had read the Exam Warriors book.
I have not read this book.
But after coming back I read this book and read it two-three times.
My experience has been very good about this.
I felt that if I had read this book earlier, I would have had a lot of benefits.
My little student friend, I thank you for writing this letter first.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
You have said that if I can take time for a new revision then I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share their experiences with you about the aspects related to stressless tests.
So I will wait for your thoughts.
I once again express my gratitude to our young friend, student Alina Tiang of Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also discussing the importance of awareness about the programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through the medium of newspapers and TV.
But you know that I am a common man like you.
I am an ordinary citizen and that is why the impact of things that happens in a common life is also on my mind in my life because I too have come from amongst you.
Just a short while before this statement, he had won the Grand Slam winners and tennis for the first time from Rafael Nadal to Final.
His views were welcomed by the audience.
Even after defeating the difficult challenges, he lauded his rival Natal and gave the livelihood of Kheldili awakening.
However, on the other hand, Winner Nadal also appreciated Daniel's sports.
Both the vigilance and the humility of the winners were worth visiting in the same match.
If you have not heard the statement of Daniel Medvedev then I will tell you all, especially the youngsters that you must see this video of it.
The thinking of our ancestors is really commendable.
We are saying in the classics: i. e. when a person gets sufficient and humility together, then who cannot win his heart
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, I am doing whatever I am going to talk directly for your good.
There will be debates, parties will continue to walk, but if some things are stopped even before it increases then it will be of great benefit.
It is very difficult to stop the things that grow very high and become very high.
But if we are aware in the beginning and stop it then a lot can be saved.
My heart says that with this feeling, today, especially the young friends, we must talk about something.
We all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful for the health and it is also very difficult to abandon its floods.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure increases to those who consume tobacco.
This is what everyone says.
The drug addiction of tobacco is due to the nickton present in it.
Its consumption in adolescence also affects the development of brain .
But today I want to talk to you about a new subject.
You must be aware that e-Secret has been banned in India recently.
E-cigarettes are a type of electronic apparatus different from common cigarettes.
The e-secret consumption of nicotine substances is a kind of chemical substance by heating nicotine substances through which nicotine is consumed.
We are well aware of the dangers of ordinary surveillance but a misconception has been created about e-services.
There is no danger to e-security.
Aromatic chemicals were obtained in it so that the remaining smoke does not spread from it.
We have seen that even if the father had a chain smoker at home, he stopped smoking the rest of the household and wanted his children to not have the habit of cigarettes.
Their efforts are such that no member of the family smokes or does not smoke.
He knows that smoking and tobacco causes heavy damage to the body.
Pinaro also knows and visitors also know.
However, the value of e-security is very different.
There is not so much awareness among people about e-security.
He is also fully aware of the dangers of this and because of this, sometimes the e-Secret Chupchap enters the house in Kutul and sometimes I am showing glimpse of it, the children keep showing each other.
Look, I am going to take a pledge from my mouth. Look, I am going to take a pledge without asking for a pledge.
Once the youth and the youth of the house are trapped in their clutches, they become addicted to this addiction and become victims of bad weather.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are obtained in e-cigarettes, which have a bad effect on health.
You know that when someone smokes around us, we get to know about it.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in its pockets, it is known by sulphur.
In such a scenario, many youngsters and youngsters are roaming around in their hands with pride in the form of a fashion statement, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes they are hunting for it.
Youth generation is the future of the country.
E-securities have been banned so that this new form of intoxication does not disturb our young nation.
The dreams of every family will not be wasted and the lives of the children will not be wasted.
This disease, this habit should not accumulate radicals in the society.
I urge you to leave tobacco addiction and do not have any guarantee regarding e-security.
Let us together build a healthy India.
These are also to be avoided for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great privilege for all of us that our India has been the birthplace and workplace of exceptional people who have dedicated their lives not for themselves but for the betterment of others.
This is our mother India, our country is a multi-faceted person.
Many human beings come from this land.
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people.
And these are the people who have dedicated themselves not for themselves but for others.
A similar great scholarship is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the Pop Francis will honour Mary Thrassia on October 13.
The work done by the Cystoms Therapeutics for the betterment of humanity in its small life span of 50 years is an example for the entire world.
Whatever work the Sister Thrassia has done, it has been completed with a sense of dedication and dedication.
Those who are still taking forward their lifestyle and mission.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thrassia. I congratulate the people of India, especially our brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, 130 crore countrymen have resolved to free themselves from single-use plastic.
Today, the vision of all the countries is based on India by seeing the way India has led the entire world in the direction of environment protection.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the campaign to get rid of single-use plastic on October 2.
They are contributing in this campaign in a way like their own.
But we have launched a very unique campaign for the youth of our country.
When I noticed their work, I spoke to them on phone and tried to know about this new experiment.
These things can also be used by other people of the country.
Mr. Rippudan Belviji is making a good effort.
When I heard the word ploging for the first time then it was a new one for me too.
Perhaps that word has been used in a few quantities abroad.
But in India, Repudiation Belvi ji has propagated it very well.
Friends, This time, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing Fit India Plogging Run on the occasion of Pujya Bapus birth anniversary.
We have heard how this programme should be done, what is happening in the programme through the experience of Ripudaman ji.
I am confident that 130 crore countrymen will take one step in this direction and our India will move 130 crore steps towards getting rid of single-use plastic.
Once again, I thank you very much.
We want to move forward to transform our lives into patriotism.
I want to remind you of one thing.
However, in the coming Mann Ki Baat, I will necessarily extend it from the area but today I am saying this because of this thing that you will get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary is on 31st October.
We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in lakhs of villages of India, children, elderly, all the people, schools, colleges and thousands of villages.
My dear countrymen, you must be reminded that on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022, you will go to 15 places in India.
Make a programme to stay for at least 15 places and one night and two nights if that is possible.
You see India, understand it, feel it.
We have so many diversities, and when these days are celebrated on the occasion of Deepawali, people are required and therefore I will again urge you to visit any such 15 places in India.
And what is this reform, where am I to you
You will be happy to know that today our cycle is 34 and five years ago our cycle was 65.
If we make more efforts then by the 5th year of independence, we will make our place in the world's leading places in tourism.
Yes, it is also necessary that in the days of Deepawali there is no loss of any person or anywhere due to cracks etc.
Whatever caution you should take for this, you must keep it.
There should be happiness, joy and enthusiasm. And our festival brings aroma of community and also brings a synthesis of community.
Community life gives a new strength, it is a celebration of the new efficiency.
Come together, let us celebrate the festivals with enthusiasm and new resolve.
Once again, my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November 2017
My dear countrymen, Nanaji.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact indirectly with the children of Karnataka.
The Times group's Vijaya Karnataka Akhbar Baldi, urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
He then published some of the selected letters.
I read those letters, I felt very good.
This small children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
On many topics, these children have written, Kirti Hegde of North Kannada has suggested by announcing Digital India and Smart Cities Scheme that we need to transform our education system.
And if we advise the children about the nature, then perhaps we can help in protecting the environment.
Rida Nadaf from Lakshmeshwar has written that she is the daughter of a soldier's army.
He said that because of the school being far away, I cannot spend time with my friends, he has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
This was a good experience for me too.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On the day of 14th, the Constituent Assembly accepted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to break the Constitution of India.
And whoever reads that discussion, we feel proud of what is the idea of a dedicated life to the nation.
Can you imagine how hard he would have done to break the Constitution of our country full of diversity
And when the country was getting free from the slaves of slavery
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is our duty to create a New India keeping in mind the ideas of the great men.
Our Constitution is very broad.
Perhaps there is no such area of life, there is no subject of nature which it has not touched.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the identity of our Constitution.
It protects the basic rights of every citizen, the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the tribal and the women.
And keeps their interests safe.
Our duty is to keep the Constitution intact.
Whether it is citizen or administrator should move forward in accordance with the spirit of Constitution.
Several Committees were constituted on important topics in the Constitution.
One of the most important committees was the Committee and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, Babasaheb Ambedkar's efficient leadership is a testimony to the Constitution of India that we feel proud of.
He ensured that every section of the society benefits.
On 6th December, on his Mahaparinirvana, we salute him by remembering him as Kayam.
Babasahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
On 15th December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's death anniversary.
Sardar Patel, who made the iron men of the country from the farmers, did an extraordinary job of binding the country on one corner.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constitution.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day, but how can the country forget that the terrorists attacked Mumbai on the 26-11th of New Year
This country cannot forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism has become an extremely dangerous form of every part of the world today and in a way.
We have been tolerating terrorism for the last 40 years in India.
At that time, there were many people in the world who were not prepared to take it seriously, but today as terrorism is throwing its mark, then every government of the world believes in humanism, governments that believe in democracy, governments are looking at terrorism as a major challenge.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
It is going to destroy human powers.
And that is why not only India but also all the humanitarian forces of the world have to defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi, this is the spirit of the earth which has given the message of violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and excitement drive our social tensions to distinguish them.
And that is why it is time for the humanitarian forces to be more aware.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of December, we will celebrate all the Naval Days.
The Indian Navy is protecting and safeguarding our seafarers.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You all are aware that our civilization is spreading beside the rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu, Ganga, Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and oceans are both economically and strategically important.
This is our entrance to the ancient world.
This country, our land has been deeply connected with the oceans.
And when we look at history, it was considered as one of the most powerful vessels at the time of the Chalukya period, eight hundred and nine hundred years ago.
In the expansion of the Fourth Celebrations, it was a very big part of his naval force in making it an economic superstition of that time.
Friends, Today too, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the Sangam literature.
Very few people would be aware that most of the world's ships had received women on the long-standing warships.
But women had played a very big role in the Fourth Army and eight hundred and nine hundred years ago and even women were involved in the fight.
Fourteen rulers had a very rich knowledge of ship building and ship building.
When we talk about the Navy, who can forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy.
The coastal areas of Konkan, which are of immense importance, came under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj such as Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. had either come near the sea or were surrounded by sea.
The responsibility of the protection of these forts was to bring the Marine Arms.
The Marine ship was accompanied by large ships and small boats.
Their naval personnel were very skilled to attack and avoid any enemy.
And when we talk about the Marine Air Force, how can it be possible to remember Kanoji Angele
He brought the Marine Navy to a new height, and laid the foundation stone of the Marine Air Force personnel at many places.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showcased their valour at different times.
Be it the freedom struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pakistan War of 11.
In May-June this year, as soon as there was a terrible crisis in Sri Lanka, three ships of our Navy reached there and helped its government and its people.
In the last month of September in Bangladesh, the INS carriage of our Navy also provided humanitarian assistance to Rohingya.
In the last month of June, when the Papua-New Guinea government sent us the message of Takid and requested us to save the fishermen of their fishing boats, our Navy helped us.
On the 21st of August, our ship INS Trikand was also able to assist in the removal of a trading ship from the antagonists in the western Akhaat.
Our naval forces have always been doing pride in providing health services to the FG Islands, providing sustainable relief and sustainable humanitarian assistance to the country.
Every countryman salutes the courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers, whether it is a landlord or an air force.
And that is why crores of Indians can live a life of happiness and that is why they sacrifice their lives for the country.
We celebrate 7th December every year as the Armed Forces Flagship.
This is the day of pride and honour for the armed forces of the country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to run the campaign from 1st to 7th December, to reach the citizens of the country and make people aware about the Armed Forces.
The entire weekend small pox will put this flag on the chest.
A movement of respect for the army begins in the country.
We can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces on this occasion.
You can post the experiences of those who are associated with the Armed Forces in your surroundings with the video and photos associated with them with armedforceflagday.
You can get information about the army from schools, colleges and labourers.
Our new generation can become a good opportunity to take care of the army.
This celebration also gives an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our armed forces.
The funds are spent on the rehabilitation of the families of the martyred soldiers and the welfare of the injured soldiers by the Soldiers Welfare Board.
On this occasion, let us do something that will enhance the morale of our armed forces.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, the fifth day is World Earth Day.
I would also like to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
Whatever we eat is linked to this soil.
In a way, the entire grain is connected to the soil.
Even after thinking, if there is no land or plantation, then how can human life be possible
This is the reason why we have been awake since ancient times by taking the importance of our land.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a simplistic effort towards farms, soil, devotion and respect among the people, on the other hand, such scientific methods that nurture this land are part of our lives.
In the lives of the farmers of this country, both things have been important, in which there is devotion to their land as well as scientific conservation of the land.
I heard about the farmers of Tohu village of Bhoranj Talku in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Earlier the farmers used chemical fertilizers and fertilizers and this led to the health of their land.
Consequently, the productivity of the land was also declining gradually.
Some farmers of the village understood the seriousness of this situation and after that they tested their land on time, as they were asked to use fertilizers, fertilizers, micro-fuels and livelihoods.
You will also be surprised to know that what was the result of the implementation of the schemes that were received by the farmers through land health and the guidance they received.
These farmers grew by three to four times the production of wheat in the season 2016-17.
Our farmers across the country have made more than ten crore soil health cards so that they can understand their land better and can also sell it in a new way.
We pray to the earth, but how do we damage the Earth with chemical fertilizers like urea
All kinds of scientific experiments have shown that giving more urea to the mother Earth causes serious damage.
The need of the hour is to revive the relationship of this motherland once again.
Our farmers, our landlords, can we make a solemn pledge that the urea they use today will be halfway when it will be 5 years of independence in 2022
What kind of changes start in the lives of the farmers
We have started to feel global warming and climate change.
There was a time when the winter had started.
Today, December is swimming twelve times and the cold is growing gradually.
But as the cold begins, we all feel that it does not seem good to get out of the jurisdiction.
However, in this season, people who are constantly awakened can bring a beautiful result and this example is inspiring for all of us.
This small child Tushar has done inspirational work in spreading the message of cleanliness.
He tells us that there is no age for cleanliness or there is no limit.
Whether it is a small child or an elderly person, a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for everyone.
And there is also a need to bicycle everybody for cleanliness.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have a pledge.
Once we are able to learn something.
Today they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is the field of sports, competition, social initiatives, our Divyangjans are not far behind.
You all will be remembered that our Divyang players won four moonlights by performing beautifully in Rio Olmpics and made champions in the Blind T Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are several types of competitions in the country.
A few days ago, the 19th National Paraswimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and introduced their skills.
He also won the Golden Jubilee in the 0th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was chosen by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralmix competition.
He is one of the 32 Para Transferees who will be trained at the Central for Accession in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the passion of Bhai Jigar Thakkar and convey my best wishes to him.
Today special attention is being paid to access and opportunities for Divyangjan.
It is our endeavour to empower every person of the country.
The creation of an inclusive society should enhance the harmony of the society and move forward together.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Id gives us a new inspiration to enhance peace and harmony in the society.
Forget grief and do not forget happiness.
I feel that we should propagate this thing.
We have been trying to remind us of the last few years of adventurous incidents in the spectacles there.
Can you contribute in it
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year
Remember such occasions inspired by others.
If we remember good things then we will wake up the spirit of doing good and the mood will be created.
It gives energy to do good.
And I will try to reach out to the countrymen in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, in the coming months, I will be here again for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
There will be an opportunity to talk a lot.
2nd October, 2017 on All India Radio
Six days after Deepawali, the Mahaparvati Chatti is one of the most relevant festivals in our country.
Traditional rules are enforced in every aspect ranging from food and beverages to washing.
The unparalleled festival of Chhath Puja is completely associated with nature and with the emergence of nature.
If the sun and water are at the centre of the ocean of the ocean, the utensils made of bamboo and soil and the potatoes are integral to its worship.
The message of the rising sunrise and the prayer of the sun is unfinished by the unparalleled culture of this magnificent occasion.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also included in this festival.
Before the Chhath, the entire house is cleaned, along with the river, pond, on the banks of Pokhra, the puja place i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environment conservation, disease prevention and discipline.
Ordinarily people understand the impossible feeling of asking for something, but in Chhath Puja there has been a special tradition of eating after asking for Prasad.
Behind this tradition of seeking Prasad, it has also been shown that it destroys arrogance.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, there is also appreciation of Mann Ki Baat.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, my belief becomes firm that the mind of the people of this country is tied to a hundred percent distressed relationship.
Take the example of Khadi and Handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been advocating for handlooms, for Khadi and what is the result
You must have been happy and satisfyed by the fact that Khadi and Handloom were sold at the same store.
During Diwali, sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation has registered an increase of about 680.
The total sales of Khadi and Handicrafts showed a growth of about 0 percent this year over the previous year.
It shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women, the elderly people of every age like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine that this will benefit many wealthy families, poor families and families working on handlooms.
Khadi is creating a powerful means of empowering the poor by bringing about a change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is playing a very big role for the rural people.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has written on the App that he wants to know about my heartfelt experience with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces feel.
Shriman Tejas Gaekwade has also written on the App, why can a system of sweetness of our house be provided to the security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that the sweetness of our house should reach the people of the country.
Deepawali will be celebrated with great fervor.
Deepawali also brought a special experience for me this time too.
I once again got the privilege of celebrating Diwali with our peoples security forces on the border.
This time it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez Sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect all the soldiers of our security forces on behalf of every countrymen for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces defend the nation by combating the difficult and odd situations on the border.
Where we get the opportunity, when we get the opportunity, we should know the experience of our soldiers, we should listen to their gloriousness.
Many of us may not be aware that our security forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only on our borders but all over the world.
Being a UN peacekeeper, he is renamed as India in the world.
In recent days, UN Day was celebrated worldwide on 24th October.
Everyone remembers the positive role of the UN in establishing peace in the world.
And we believe that the whole world is our family.
And that is why India has been actively involved in various important initiatives of the UN since its inception.
You must be aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with both the words WETHE PEOPLE.
India has always emphasized on female equality and UN DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS is a living standard.
All men are borne free and equal, which was transformed by the efforts of India's representative laughter and later accepted, All Human Beings are borne free and equal.
Although this seems to be a very small change, but a healthy thought is seen in it.
Many of your mothers will be getting this information for the first time.
Over 18 thousand Indian security forces have provided their services in the UN PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN PEACEKEPING INITIATIVES and is the third largest figure in the world.
By August 2019, Indian soldiers have provided their services to around 50 OPERATIONS from UN worldwide PEACEEPING OPERATIONS.
These OPERATIONS runs in many countries in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and other parts of the world.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at Indian Army Hospital in Kongo and Southern Sudan and saved unlimited people.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by doing People Friendly Operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peace.
Very few people would be aware that India was the first country to send Female Police Unit to the United Nations Peace Mission in Liberia.
And, see, this step of India has become an inspiration for the countries around the world.
And after that all the countries started sending their own Women Police Unit.
You will be proud to know that India's role is not limited to Peacekeeping operations alone, but India also works to train the Peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and prosperity all over the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not easy.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work in difficult areas.
People have to stay in different places.
Different circumstances and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to bear the local requirements and demands there.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was honoured with the supreme cycle.
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who made a unique identity in Cyprus.
In 18, at the age of two years, he was made a Force Commander for Operating in Namibia and he provided his services to ensure the country's independence.
General Thimayya, who has also been the head of the Indian Army, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and made his all-round reinforcement for peaceful purposes.
India has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony in the world as a peacekeeper.
Our belief is that everybody lives peace, harmony and moves forward towards building a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our land has been decorated with great people who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagini's statement, was also one of the extraordinary people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
And the meaning of the statement is that which is fully dedicated.
He later proved himself in accordance with his name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was so impressed with Swami Vivekananda that he left his happy and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was very sad to be in the British state.
The British had not only slaughtered our country but they also tried to make us mentally embarrassed.
This work was going on continuously by showing down our culture and creating an impoverished spirit among us.
Bhagini Niveditaji re-established the glory of Indian culture.
They worked to unite the people by creating national consciousness.
He went to different countries across the globe and raised his voice against the evil propagandas committed to the cause of peace and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is famous for his revolutionary poem 'Pudumi Panna', New Women and Women Empowerment.
It is said that it was inspired by Bhagini's statement.
Bhagini Niveditaji also supported the great scientific Jagdish Chandra Bus.
He assisted in publishing and propagating bus research through his writings and conventions.
It is a special beauty of India that spirituality and science are supplementary to each other in our culture.
Bhagini's statement and scientific Jagadishchandra Bus is a strong example of this.
In 1988, a huge plague took place in Kolkata and hundreds of people died in the wake of the disaster.
Bhagini Nivedita started the work of cleaning the neck and roads without worrying about her health.
He was a woman who could lead a comfortable life but was dedicated to the service of the poor.
He was inspired by this sacrifice and looked after them in service works.
He explained the importance of cleanliness and service to the people through his work.
And it is written on his philosophy - "Here Repositions Sister Navedita who gave her all to India" - here Bhagini's statement is restoring which he dedicated to India.
This is what he did.
Today, for this great personality, there can be no more reverence than this that every Indian should take inspiration from his life and try to walk on the path of service.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on Children's Day on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important heroes of building a New India.
Your anxiety is true that the diseases that had earlier occurred in the old age and the last phase of life were seen in the children today.
Today it is very surprising when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
These diseases were fortunate in the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle diseases.
There is one of the major causes of this kind of illness in the young age - reduction in physical activity in our lifestyle and change in the way we drink.
The society and the family need to pay attention to this.
When they think about it, you will see that there is no need to distinguish anything.
It is necessary to change your habits and make it a habit of yourself by keeping the small things intact and regularly.
I would like to urge the family members to try that the children will adopt the habit of going to the open ground.
If possible, the elders of our family should also go to the open along with these children.
Instead of bringing the children up in the lift, they have to go to Dadra Madhi.
After dinner the whole family walks a little while keeping the children together .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga will especially help our young friends to maintain a healthy lifestyle and save them from lifestyle problems.
Thirty minutes before going to school, see how beneficial it is.
You can do it at home and the specialty of Yoga is the same - it is easy, easy, accessible. And I am just saying that a person of any age can easily do it.
Several studies are being conducted to know how Yoga is effective in controlling diabetes.
It is also being studied in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very boosting.
We should not only treat Ayurveda and Yoga as a means of treatment but also make it a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been good news in the last few days in the field of sports.
Our sportspersons have brightened the name of our country in different sports.
India has won the title of Asia Cup hockey by playing a grand game in Hockey.
Our sportspersons have excelled and made India a Asia Cup champion after 10 years.
Earlier, India became Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2000.
My best wishes to the entire team and helping staff on behalf of the countrymen.
After Hockey, good news has also come to India in Badminton.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has excelled in excellent exhibition and has won the Denmark Open Kittab and has created a sense of pride in every Indian.
This is his third Super Series Premier Kittab after the Indonesia Open and the Australian Open.
I congratulate our young friends for this achievement and for enhancing India's pride.
The FIFA U-1 World Cup was organised this month.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their warmth on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
The sportspersons were very enthusiastic.
The whole world is watching you...
I was stunned to see the energy, enthusiasm of all young players and the spirit of showing something.
The World Cup was successful and all the teams performed their best.
However, India could not win the mill but the youth of India won the hearts of everyone.
The entire world, including India, celebrated this festival of sports and this entire competition was eager and entertaining for football lovers.
The future of Football is very bright, its signals are visible.
I once again congratulate all the players, their colleagues and all the sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, as many people write to me about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of doing justice with their feelings then I will have to organize a Mann Ki Baat programme everyday and I will have to dedicate to Mann Ki Baat on the subject of cleanliness.
If someone sends a fountain of the efforts of the mistakes, then there is a case of collective efforts of the youth.
Sometimes there is talk of innovation with cleanliness or there is a news of changes that have been brought about by a public servant.
In the last few days, I have received a very detailed report of the transformation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGs, called Ecological Programme Organisation, undertook the cleanliness drive of Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me the testimony of the fort before and after cleanliness.
I was stunned to see the fountains and I would like to tell them how to fulfil the dream of cleanliness. You can see the youth, sweat of the electrical projection organisation and their resolve in the live tests.
Your devotion will be transformed into confidence as soon as you look at it.
This striving endeavour of cleanliness is a unique example of beauty, collectivity and eternity.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
Our fellow countrymen have the responsibility to safeguard and clean the historical heritage.
I congratulate the Ecological Protection Organization and its entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on 4th November.
He thought of the welfare of the entire human race, he described all the castes as equal.
He emphasized on women empowerment and women honour.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28 thousand kilometers on foot and during his visit, he gave a message of true humanity.
He interacted with the people, showing them the path of righteousness, sacrifice and hard work.
He conveyed the message of equality in the society, and showed his message not only with words but with his work.
He launched a langar, which gave rise to service among the people.
The feeling of unity and equality among the people was enlightened by sitting and holding anchor.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of meaningful life - joy, hard work, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji also created Gurbani to say his words.
We are going to celebrate the 550th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji in 2019.
Come, let us try to move forward on the path of their message and teaching.
My dear countrymen, after two days we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31st October.
We all know that he had laid the foundation of a modern unbroken India.
Today we can learn a lot from this unprecedented journey of this great saint of Mother India.
On 31st October, Smt. Indira Gandhi left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was that he not only gave transformative ideas but he was also expert in finding out the behavioural solution of a very difficult problem to showcase it.
He was shocked to realize the idea.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel took care of the dryness of binding India in a formula.
He ensured that crores of Indians are brought under the guise of One Nation and One Constitution.
His decision-making ability enabled him to overcome all barriers.
While there was a need for honorarium, he paid homage, where Balproof was needed.
He said that there cannot be any difference between caste and creed, all of us are the daughters and daughters of India, all of us should love our country and build our principles on mutual love and harmony.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant for the vision of our New India.
And this is the reason that his birth day is celebrated as National Ekta Diwas.
His contribution in shaping the nation as an integral nation is incredible.
On 31st October, the 'Run for Unity' will be organized across the country on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, which will include children, youth, women, all age groups from across the country.
I urge you to also participate in this celebration of "Run for Unity".
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, with a new resolve, with a new determination, you all have once again joined your everyday life.
My dear countrymen, you all are Namaskar.
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat, people from all parts of the country reach me, perhaps I can tell you very few things but I get a lot of temptations.
Most of them inspire me.
Many of them are for reforms in the government.
Sometimes there are personal complaints and sometimes attention is drawn towards community problems.
And I take half an hour for you once in a month, but people talk about Mann Ki Baat on a thirteenth day.
And as a result of this, the government is also getting an easy feeling of sensitivity and how powers have been created in a far-flung society.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am extremely grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity that I have got to know the feelings of the common man of the country.
And I am confident that this idea will also be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future.
When I had once said in Mann Ki Baat that we should worry while eating or take as much as we need, we should not waste it.
But after that I saw that all the letters from every section of the country came to me, many social organizations and many youngsters have been doing this work since the beginning.
I am glad that many people who have worked on the way food is being utilised by mixing the food that is left in the plate so that my mind is very satisfied and very happy.
And after that I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the selfie with the daughter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I talked to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
A massive campaign of selfie with daughter has been launched not only in India but in the entire world.
This is not just the issue of social media.
This is a new self-confidence, a new pride in every daughter.
Every mother and father felt that I too should take selfies with my daughter.
Every daughter feels that I have any greatness, I have some importance.
In the past, I had a meeting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Whenever I asked the people going to Tour to send a photo on the Incredible India wherever you go.
Millions of people from every corner of India, in a way, have become very invaluable for those working in the tourism sector.
I have experienced in Mann Ki Baat how big a movement starts with a small movement.
Today I feel like saying all these things because when I was thinking that three years have passed then several incidents of the last three years have been hidden in my mind.
The country is constantly moving towards the right direction.
For the betterment of every citizen of the country, for the betterment of the society, for the progress of the country, I have learnt and understood from my countrymen in my three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
This is a very big capital for any country.
I heartily salute the countrymen.
Whether it is a tower or a tower, the experience is that the attraction of Khadi has increased in the youth generation.
Khadi sales have increased and this has led to direct employment in the houses of the poor.
Discount is given in Khadi from 2nd October and many relaxations are given.
I once again urge you to carry forward the campaign of Khadi and increase it.
Let us work with this feeling that the poorest of the poor will have Diwali.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And due to the increase in interest towards this deficit, the people working in the Khadi sector have also been encouraged to think in a new way in the Khadi people in the Government of India.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase the productivity, how to bring solar-efficiency
How to revive the old legacy that had been closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years
In Varanasi Sewapur, Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sewapuri had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several types of activities were added.
Several people were given new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir have resumed its closed training center and Kashmir has a lot to provide in this area.
Now due to the resumption of this training centre, it will help the new generation to do modern work, to do business, to make new things. And I am feeling very good that when the big corporate house also offers Khadi goods in the day, it is now getting the goods of Khadi.
People have also started offering Khadi items as gifts to each other.
We all feel that how things move forward with a comfortable spirit.
My dear countrymen, we had made a pledge in Mann Ki Baat last month and we had decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti, we will celebrate the festival of cleanliness across the country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our Hon'ble President has initiated this work and added the country.
Whether it is a child, a man or a woman, a city or a village, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness drive today.
And when I say that this cleanliness drive is progressing towards a resolution, we are seeing it in front of our eyes.
Everyone accepts it, supports it, and contributes to it.
This time, it is one thing that we should do cleanliness somewhere, the other is that we should not waste ourselves by being aware, but if we want to make cleanliness a natural environment then a formal movement is also important.
This time several competitions were held with Swachhata Hi Seva.
Over two and a half crore children participated in Swachhta Pension.
Thousands of children made pictures.
As far as cleanliness is concerned, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
Our country's electronic media, how much our country's print media can serve the country, we can see it in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
Just a few days back, somebody paid attention to the 18-year-old youth of Srinagar, Bill Dar.
And you will be happy to know that the Srinagar Municipal Corporation has constructed its brand Ambassador for cleaning Bill Dar and when it comes to Brand Ambassador, you will feel that perhaps he will be an artist with a cinema.
Bill Dar himself has been engaged in cleanliness for the past 5-6 years from the age of 12-13 years.
Be it plastic, polythene, waste or waste, the biggest lake in Asia is near Srinagar.
They also earn a little.
Because his father died in a very young age due to cancer but he also linked his life with cleanliness.
I also want to convey my best wishes to the Srinagar Municipal Corporation for their initiative towards cleanliness and their imagination of Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India wants to go to Srinagar and it is a great thing to get so much strength in cleanliness there.
And I am glad that they have not only built Brand Ambassador but they have given Billa a car this time, they are trained in other areas for cleanliness, inspired and lagged behind till the results are brought out.
Bill Dar is a small age, but it is a reason for inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
The month of October is a month to remember many great men for us.
These great personalities gave us direction for the 20th century and 21st century, led us, guided us and laid great difficulty for the country.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji, on October 11, the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji on September 25.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
And what was the central point of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and that was to live for the country, to do something for the country and not just sermons but to guide the people through its conduct in their lives.
Gandhiji, Jayaprakash ji, Deendayal ji are all such great men who have stayed away from the power jurisdiction but have lived with the lives of the people, have been jealous and all the people have been doing well.
My dear countrymen, when we are celebrating his centenary year, it is very natural to pay attention to the work of his village.
When the former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalamji spoke to the youth, he always talked about the rural development of the country.
He himself went to the village to see this work of smallness.
It is not for them to remember all these great men because they remember these great men so that we can find a way forward.
In the coming Mann Ki Baat, I will surely mention Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but on 31st October, the Run for Unity Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat program will be organized across the country.
In every city of the country, there should be a massive run for unity programme in every city and this season is also such that it is necessary to gain iron power like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also run for unity and move forward the mantra of unity.
We are very naturally saying unity in diversity, India's specialty.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I will repeatedly tell my countrymen of India and especially my younger generation that we are in a conscious state.
Let it feel the diversity of India, touch them and feel their fragrance.
You see, these diversities of our country work as a huge school for the development of your personality.
There is a vaccination, it is a day of Diwali, there is a habit of travelling around our country, people go as migrants and it is very natural.
But sometimes there is anxiety that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of the country, we don't understand, but we have started enjoying foreign tourism by coming under the influence of zeal.
You go anywhere in the world, I don't have a promise, but sometimes see your house too.
Whether the person of North India knows what is in South India
Whether the person of western India knows what is in Eastern India
Our country is full of diversity.
All these great men have made a wide range of India.
In the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
India has tried to live within itself.
Can we try to teach and understand the different states of our country, different societies, groups, their traditions, their dresses and their beliefs as a student
The value addition in tourism will be done only when we do not just visit, but try to contribute to them as a student.
I have my own experience that I have got the opportunity to go to more than 500 districts of India.
More than four and a half districts will be such that I would have got the opportunity to travel by night. And today when I am taking this responsibility in India, I feel the experience of tourism is very useful.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
I urge you to feel the stagnation of the immense power of our vast India by calling for unity in diversity.
The dream of One India Best India is incorporated in it.
How variety of food is there
Even if the entire life remains a different diet everyday then there will never be any repetition of any diet.
This is a great strength of our tourism.
Reason the diversity of Kotikoti ji.
This experience will make your life prosperous.
Your vision will become huge.
And who can be a big teacher with experience
Ordinarily the period from October to March is mostly from tourism.
People travel.
I am confident that if you go this time too, you will take this campaign forward.
Wherever you go, share your experience, share your testimony.
Your photo must be sent on Incredible India.
If you want to meet the people of that place then you should also send a photo of it.
Not only the natural beauty but also the lives of the people there.
Write good rules of your journey.
If possible, it should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about it
If all the people of a state are talking about this then I will tell the government that it should be fulfilled and it will prepare a newspaper on the seven most common things about every state.
In a way, it is my aim to encourage tourist destinations in a way by the people's views.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come on, join me.
You can also play an important role in enhancing the tourism of the country using the time from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, many things touch me as a human being.
My heart is hailed.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
Well, I am a person like you.
We have seen a unique example of women power and patriotism.
We can imagine that when the world has grown in this young age, how will they have a mindset
For 11 months, he worked hard and trained and dedicated his life to fulfil his dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubena's father Raksha Dubey used to work as a hero in the army and he was martyred for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided to join the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to pay respect to our mothers and sisters.
I congratulate both of these sisters on their hearts.
He has given a new inspiration, a new consciousness to the people of Koti-Koti.
Congratulations to both these sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and also the occasion of Deepawali is a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The World Cup of FIFA Under 1 is being held there.
I am confident that football will be spread all around.
The juice of every generation will increase in football.
There should not be any school, college field in India where our youngsters are not seen sports.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when the entire world is playing on the soil of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is an opportunity to worship Mother Durga.
The entire atmosphere is full of pure fragrance.
The atmosphere of spirituality all around, the atmosphere of festivals, the atmosphere of devotion and this festival is celebrated as a festival of means of power.
He is known as Sharia Navratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Maa Shakti that our country will attain new heights to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country has the potential to face every challenge.
When the country progresses at a rapid pace and 75 years of India's independence in 2022, then the effort to fulfil the dreams of those who have laid down their lives for freedom should be the resolve of crores of people, we should come out by making a five-year rod map to realise that resolve of untiring hard work and untiring mortality.
My best wishes to you all.
Festivals should also be celebrated.
Mann Ki Aug 2019
My dear countrymen, Sadar Nath.
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand, when violence is detected from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who has given full strength to the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, abhinsa and equal respect.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: This is what we have heard from ourselves.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be accompanied by the name of Ashta, whether it is a religious belief, whether it is a faith in political beliefs, whether it is faithful to the person, whether it is a tradition.
The Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, has every kind of system of justice for every person.
I want to assure the countrymen, those who take the laws, those who blame for the prevention of violence, whether it is a person or a group, this country will never tolerate or tolerate any government.
Everyone will have to face the law, decide the responsibility of the law and continue to punish the evils.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every way of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity and due to our cultural heritage thousands of years old, there should be cultural traditions, social traditions, if we want historical traditions then perhaps there will be a few days left in 365 days which we are not associated with any festival there.
Now we must have noticed that every festival of ours is run according to the time-bound letters of nature.
There is a direct relationship with nature.
Our financial festivals are directly linked to the farmers and are associated with the fishermen.
Today, I am talking about festivals. First of all, I want to call you Michami Dukkam.
Yesterday's festival was celebrated in the Jain community.
In the Jain community, the festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava.
The last day of the festival is the festival day.
This is indeed a unique tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, violence and friendship.
It is also called the festival of forgiveness in a way and on this day it is a tradition of calling each other Michami Dukkadam.
The Georgespeare has written in his play The Merchant of Venice the importance of forgiveness - Mercy is two blessed, it blesses him that gives him and him that takes forgiveness, both of them receive the blessings of God.
Bal Gangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and he became a symbol of freedom movement 125 years ago.
And since independence, he became a symbol of social education and social consciousness.
The festival from Ganesh Chaturthi runs for 10 days.
This Mahaparva is said to be a symbol of unity, harmony and engagement.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
Recently, the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of India is the festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
The festival of Onam demonstrates the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival offers a message of love and harmony in the society and offers new hope, new confidence in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming the reason for tourism attraction.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal, tourism has become an attraction in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think of what we can do in this direction.
Within a few days in the series of festivals, the festival of Id-ul-uha will be celebrated across the country.
Id-ul-uha greetings to every countrymen.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and belief for us but we also have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and cleanliness are linked to family life.
Preparation of festivals is valid, clean and clean.
It is not a new thing for us but it is also important to become a social nature.
Public hygiene must not only be an integral part of the house but also of the entire village, of the entire city, of the entire city, of our state, of our country, of those festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of modernization are changing.
Recently, a new dimension, a new parameter, you are so modern, how modern your thought process is, a trick is also being used to find out how modern it is.
If it is against it, it is considered bad in the society today.
And as a result of this thing, today I see that even in Ganeshotsav, a big campaign has been started.
If you go to YouTube then every household children are making Ganeshji and making Ganeshji by bringing the soil.
Various kinds of experiments are being done in every family.
In a way, such a comprehensive training of environment consciousness was found in the Ganesh festival which had never been seen before.
Media House is also training, inspiring and guiding people for a large number of eco-friendly idols.
And as I said, our country is full of crores and crores of people.
And it looks very good when new innovations are known.
Someone told me that there is a gentleman who himself is an engineer, he mixed soil in a unique way and gave training to people to compile it and make it a glass.
And if wheat is irrigated in water then it keeps water in one dollar so that it gets mixed in water immediately.
Three years ago, when Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will complete three years on 2nd October.
And its positive results are visible.
The coverage of toilets has reached from 3 to 6.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from defecation in Khullah.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when water was reduced after floods, so much dirt was spread everywhere.
In such a scenario, the workers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
All those who sweat came out.
The best example of unity for cleanliness was given by every worker of Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind who inspired everyone.
The effort made by dedication to cleanliness, if it becomes our permanent nature, then where can our country reach
We should explore opportunities wherever we get an opportunity.
But all of us should join.
Work together on Sundays or Sundays.
Go to the population of Adosh-Padesh, go to the nearby villages, but do it as a movement.
In this section, a section has been created where after construction of toilets, you can name yourself and the name of that family which you have helped.
Friends of my social media can run a constructive campaign and the work done in the virtual world can be a source of inspiration.
This mission of Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is a competitive competition for you, a competition to make short films, a competition for paintings is being organized.
You can write restrictions in different languages and there is no limit to age, no age limit.
You can make a short film with your mobile phone.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that inspires cleanliness.
They can be in any language, they can also be silent.
Those who participate in this competition and those who select three best, three on district level and three on state level will be awarded.
So I invite everyone to join you in this campaign of cleanliness.
I would like to once again say that on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti will be celebrated as Swachh 2nd October and for this, from 15th September to 15th September, cleanliness will not reach the mantra of the same service.
Definitely take any steps for cleanliness.
Be a partner in this by working hard.
You will see how this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine.
You can imagine that after this 15-day cleanliness drive, after the same service, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, we will have a pure pleasure in paying homage to the venerable Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I specially want to accept the acceptance of everyone.
I want to express my gratitude to you from the depths of my heart. It is not that you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time but I want to thank you because lakhs of people from every corner of the country join this programme without Mann Ki Baat.
The number of listeners is not only in crores but lakhs of people write to me letters, sometimes messages are sent, sometimes a message comes on the phone, which is a very big film for me.
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
Moreover, I look forward to waiting for your messages than to listen to the awaiting mindset.
Sometimes things become a part of our habit that we don't think we're wrong.
Prime Minister, I am calling upon Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my colleagues.
He has always tried to help the people, but I am distressed about one habit of it.
I had once agreed to shop with him.
For a sari, he spent 200 rupees comfortably, and the autorickshaw that he had taken for a patch of Rs. 450, and to the mall, he continued to earn for a long time with the rickshaw driver for five rupees.
While returning, they bought vegetables on the way and saved four-five rupees by refinance on every vegetable.
I felt very bad.
We have to pay big bills without asking them once and we have to fight for a few rupees with our labouring brothers and sisters.
Do you not think that whenever we come to our house to sell some goods, some fertilizers, some small shopkeepers or vegetable sellers, or some other autorickshaw drivers, whenever we come in contact with people living with hard work, we start emotionalizing with them.
And whenever we go to some big restaurant, we don't even see what we have written in the bill.
Not only this, we go to buy saris in the showroom, even then we dont have any emotions, but we cannot remain without emotions with any poor person.
What would happen in the minds of the poor have we ever thought of
For this, the question is not of two-five rupees, but it is sad that you are poor and therefore you have doubts about its honesty.
You don't have any difference in your life for two-five rupees, but have you ever thought that this small habit of yours would have hurt him deeply
Madam, I am grateful to you, you have given me a message by calling me to touch your heart.
I am confident that if my countrymen also have the habit of dealing with the poor then they will surely leave.
My dear young friends, on the 2nd of August, the entire nation celebrates as National Sports Day.
This day is the birth anniversary of the great Hockey Player and Hockey's glorious Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I remember this thing because I want to connect with the new generation of our country with sports.
Sports is part of our lives.
If we are counted among the youngsters of the world then we should also look at this young age in the field of sports.
Sports i. e. physical fitness, mental alternates, personality enhancement, I understand what should be more than this
In a way, sports is a huge pool of heartbeats.
The youngsters of our country move forward in sports and today in the computer era, I also want to be conscious that the playing field is even more important than that of a platform.
On the computer, please communicate with the football even in the field outside the pipeline.
You will be playing cricket on the computer but playing cricket below the sky in the open field is enjoyable.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and all of us asked, When will you come back
Today, the situation is such that children start watching cartoon movies in one corner as soon as they come to their homes or they get stuck on mobile games and then they have to say that when will they go out
It was also a time when mother used to tell the child when she would come and today the situation is that mother has to say - "Beta, when will she go out"
Youth Friends, The Ministry of Sports has prepared a Sports talent search portal to explore and upload the sports talent where any child in the country who has a unique achievement in the sports sector can upload his bio-data or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to selected newly elected players.
Let us welcome our young athletes from all over the world with this festival of sports and sports and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share with the countrymen as a result of my touching upon my mind last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some young daughters and some of them were born in the Himalayas.
It is like this that the six daughters of our country who have never had any relation with the sea, the enthusiasm and courage of those who work in the Navy inspires us all.
These six daughters, a small boat will have to cross the ocean by taking INS Tarini.
This campaign has been named - Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will roam around the world after months and months.
Sometimes 40-40 days in water, sometimes 30-30 days in water.
Our six daughters, along with the bravery of the sea wave, are going to be the first event in the world.
Who would be Indians who would not be proud of our daughters
I salute the enthusiasm of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire nation.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read it from the necessity because it is a tale of courage, a story of self-confidence and I am glad to send the ideas of these daughters to you.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we celebrate all the Teachers' Day.
Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji's birthday.
He was the President, but life was presenting himself as a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
Great Scientist Albert Einstein said - "It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
It is the most important quality of a teacher to enjoy creative emotions and knowledge in our students.
This time when we celebrate Teachers' Day, can we all make a resolve together
And when we talk of transformation in our country, the way in which the mother is remembered in the family, the teacher is remembered in the society.
Teachers have a big role in transformation.
Sometimes, in the life of every teacher, there has been such incidents that their sympathetic efforts would have been successful in bringing about changes in the lives of somebody.
If we make a collective effort, we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come, let's take the mantra of Teach to Transform.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is Dr.
Anonymous.
I live in Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre in the Harvard University.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Ministers Jan Dhan Yojana, financial inclusion, has been a matter of discussion not only in India but in the entire world.
On 28th August, 2014, he launched this mission with a dream in his mind.
Yesterday, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
30 crore new families have been linked to it and bank accounts have been opened.
This figure is even more than that of many countries of the world.
Today, I am very satisfied that within three years my poor brothers and sisters sitting on the last corner of the society have become a part of the economy of the country, their habits have changed, they have started moving around in the bank, they have started saving the money, they have been feeling the security of the money.
About 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
In a way, this saving of the poor is their strength in the coming days.
And those who have opened their accounts with Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - Rs.
In many families, because of the insurance of one rupee, when the poor were stricken, the life of the mother of the family came to an end, in a few days she got two lakh rupees.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana - be it Dalits, Tribals, women, select youngsters, be it self-reliant youth, millions and millions of youngsters from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, bank accounts without any guarantee.
Not only this, everyone has also made a successful effort to provide employment to every single person.
A few days ago, the people of the bank met me because of the Jan Dhan Yojana, because of the Rupay card due to insurance, they did the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana to the common man and several inspiring cases came up.
Today, there is not much time but I will urge the bankers to make such cases MyGov.
He can also inspire new generations by introducing such people.
The changing weather cycle and environment are having a very negative impact.
In the past few days some areas of India, particularly Assam, ISAN India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have faced natural calamities due to extreme disasters.
The areas affected by such floods are being closely monitored.
Relief is being done at a large scale.
My cabinet colleagues are also reaching Ruburu.
The State Governments are also making immense efforts to help the sufficient number of suppliers.
Social organizations, cultural organizations and serving citizens are also making immense efforts to help people in such situations.
Whether it is the army personnel, the Air Force personnel, the National Disaster Relief Force, the NDRF personnel, the Armed Forces, all of them join hands in serving the victims.
Life becomes very disturbed due to floods.
NDRF teams executed.
The meeting was made friendly and trained on what to do and what not to do during the disaster.
Self-servicemen have been prepared and they have learnt to work in a difficult situation by creating a Lok Sabha.
Gradually, we should also create such a habit that we should combine our activities according to the weather conditions so that we can avoid harm.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time all the letters related to GST have been received so many phone calls have been received.
And still people are expressing happiness over GST and also expressing their gratitude.
And I also read a phone call to you, Nalanda Prime Minister, I speak from Gurgaon Nityu Garg.
I heard your Chartered Accountants Day speech and I am very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was started on the same day in our country last month.
Can you tell me whether the government is getting the same results after a month or not
I want to know your thoughts about this.
And when a poor person writes to me that because of GST, the feelings of the poor have reduced, the things have become cheap, then I feel very satisfied and happy.
Recently, I was watching the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the income of the trucks has increased.
How is it taking less time to cut the distance
The highways are free of traffic jams.
Earlier, due to separation of taxes, most of the resources of the transport and logistics sector were kept in operation and they had to make their new godowns in every state.
However, GST is what I call good and simple technology.
He has truly made a very positive impact on our economy and has impacted in a very short time.
The rapid transformation that has been transformed into one another has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes the experts of the economy, experts of management, technologists, and the use of GST in India as models will be presented to the world.
This will be a case study for many universities of the world.
All decisions have been taken unanimously in collaboration with States and Centre.
And this is the result of this thing that every government has had the same priority that due to GST, there is no pressure on the poorest of the poor.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments, the Central and State Government employees.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again I congratulate crores of countrymen for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the revolution of the month of August is a month.
We have been listening to it since childhood. And this is the reason that on August 1, 120, the Non-Cooperation Movement has started.
August, 142, the uit India Movement, which is known as the Augmented Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th, the country became independent.
In a way, several incidents of independence have been specially linked in the month of August.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people know that Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali had given the slogan of uit India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 142.
The way the countrymen continued to fight and tolerate freedom struggle from 185 to 142 is our inspiration to build India.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for India's freedom movement.
The movement was resolved by the entire nation for the freedom of British rule.
This was the time when the Indian democracy had become a part of the uit India Movement by combining the British rule in the country's pockets, in the villages, in the cities, in the cities, in the educated, the poor, the poor, the immigrants and the Haracoites.
Jan Akrosh was at its peak.
On the auspicious occasion of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians were embracing their lives with the mantra of 'You die'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and left their books.
The bugle of freedom had come out.
Mahatma Gandhi had called for the uit India Movement in August, but all the great leaders were thrown into prison by the British.
And it was time that great men like Dr. Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan played a leading role in the country.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement, two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi appear in 120 and 142.
The nature of the non-cooperation movement was different and the situation in which 42 was different, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave a mantra of his deaths.
This success was the backbone of democracy, the peoples power.
The nation was determined, the peoples struggle, the entire nation was fighting together.
Sometimes I think that if we want to add a few leaves of history then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1855.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1985, was going on in some corner of the country by 142.
This long period has replaced the hearts of our countrymen with a blaze of freedom.
Everyone has become committed to facilitating something.
Generations changed, but there was no reduction in the resolution.
The country has been making every effort to boost the British rule.
This exercise from 185 to 142 created a situation in which the movement reached the peak in 1942 and the queen of the shores of India had to go to 14th in five years.
The five years from 142 to 14 years of independence reached the masses of 185 to 142 freedom fighters and became one such nation.
This was a decisive five years.
Now I want to connect you with this principle.
In 1947, we became independent and today is 201.
About 70 years have passed since the formation of governments, systems, changes, grown, and everybody has tried their best to free the country from problems.
Similarly, there was a decisive five years of achievement from 142 to 14 resolutions.
I see that from 2019 to 2022, a further five-year period from resolution to achievement has come to our fore.
We will celebrate the 15th of August of 2019 as a solemn pledge and when we mark the 5th anniversary of independence in 2022, we will continue to achieve that pledge.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolves.
So, as the five years of 142-14 became decisive for the country's independence, these five years can also be decisive and constructed for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
After five years, we will celebrate 5 years of independence.
Come, let us run a magnificent campaign from August to August in this month.
Every Indian, social organisation, local bodies, schools, colleges, different organisations take a pledge for every New India.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Today, I am specially online world because we are not, but online is essential.
I invite my young friends, the online world and especially my young friends to come forward to contribute innovatively to the creation of a New India.
Use technology, use videos, posts, blogs, scripts, new ideas, come up with all these things.
May this zeal be transformed into a mass movement.
Narendra Modi will also launch a quiet India quiz for young friends on the App.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must propagate it and spread it.
One person does not speak there, the voice of 1. 25 billion countrymen from the Red Fort is echoing.
This time too, I invite you to send me your thoughts on MY GOV or on Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and will try to publish whatever time I have on August 15.
In the last three years, I got to hear a complaint in my 15th August that my speech becomes a little longer.
Whether success is achieved or not.
Friends, I want to tell you one thing.
India has a socio-economic science in the economy.
And we should never undermine it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just a joyous occasion.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
But with this, every festival has a direct link between the poorest of the poor in the economic life.
After a few days Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, subsequent Ganesh Festival, the fourth moon, then Anant Chaudas, Deepavali, one after the other, and one after the other.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before the defence mission, hundreds of families have started making hostels in small domestic enterprises.
Thousands of manufacturers, sellers, sweets, vendors and vendors enter into a festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters runs by it only.
It is not just that light festival, it is a festival, it is not just a house.
It is directly related to the poor families that make small walls of soil.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware than me and are more active.
For the past one month, the citizens who have been consistent with the environment have written letters to me.
He has urged you to talk about Eco-Friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturbhuti, so that people can plan for soil healthcare from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to speak on this topic before time.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji launched this great tradition this year is the 125th year of the Ganesh festival.
Once again, let us recall the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak in this year of Ganeshotsav.
And once again, how should we take the Ganeshotsav in the direction of the spirit of Tilak ji, how to strengthen this spirit and also to protect the environment, our resolve is to create eco-friendly glaciers and soil fertilizers.
And I have said this time very soon
I am sure that you will join me and this will benefit the poor worker, poor artists, idol makers and the poor will get employment.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals becomes the economic festival of the poor and it becomes the economic pleasure of all of us.
I convey my best wishes to every countrymen for the coming festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly trying to ensure that the education sector, the economic sector, the social sector, the sports and the sports sector, our daughters are encouraging the country and achieving new heights.
We are proud of our daughters.
Recently, our daughters performed a grand exhibition in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters this week.
I felt very good talking to him, but I was feeling that he could not win the world cup.
He also had pressure on his face and was stressed.
We have seen many such sports that if the Indian sportsperson fails in this thing then the anger of the country falls on those players.
Some people say such things by breaking the limits so that there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time when our daughters were unable to succeed in the world, 1. 25 billion countrymen took the defeat and they did not fall on their daughters.
Moreover, these daughters have glorified their virtues and their glory.
In fact, the younger generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to enrich the country.
Once again I extend my heartiest congratulations to the youth of the country, especially to our daughters.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the August Revolution and once again I recall August 15th August, I once again remember the 75th anniversary of independence.
Every citizen of the country should make a pledge and prepare a five-year roadmap to fulfil the resolve of every citizen.
We all have to take this country to new heights, to bring it to new heights.
Let us walk together and keep doing something.
May the fate of the country be excellent, let it move forward with confidence.
My best wishes.
The weather is changing.
The weather has become pleasant due to rain in many parts of the country.
After the rains, there is a feeling of relief from the heat in the cold winds in the past.
And we have seen that there are many problems in life, however stress, individual life, public life, the arrival of rain changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated in many parts of the country with great devotion and fervor.
Now in some parts of the world, the festival of Lord Jagannath ji's chariot is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
Those who have received a sum of Rs.
He must have studied Baba Saheb Ambedkar, he must have seen that he used to appreciate Lord Jagannath's temple and its traditions because it included social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannath ji is the God of the poor.
And very few people would be aware that there is a word in English, a juggernaut and it means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And it is also seen in the Directory of this Journal that this word has emerged along with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has adopted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath, I extend my greetings to all fellow citizens and pay my respects to Lord Jagannath ji.
Indias diversity is also its specialty, the diversity of India which is also the strength of India.
The people of the holy month of Ramzan celebrated Idabad with a sacred spirit.
Now is the festival of Id.
My best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramadan is a month of worship.
It is a month to share happiness and the happiness that we share.
Let us share the spirit of happiness by taking inspiration from these sacred festivals and take the country forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, I came across an inspirational incident of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Nearly three and a half thousand of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in a small village. In a way, more than one crore people belong to our Muslim family.
The people of the village have decided to make toilets in this Ramzan.
And within this individual toilet, assistance is also provided by the government and about 1 lakh rupees have been given to them.
These 1 lakh rupees should be spent on other facilities of the village.
I congratulate every villager of Mubarakpur for transforming this sacred occasion of Ramzan into the opportunity of good for the society.
One of his things is also very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that he freed Mubarakpur from open defecation.
We know that three regions of our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, which have already been declared open defecation free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, governance and people of these five states for fulfilling this task.
We are very aware that if we have to do something good in the life of the individual, in the life of the society then we have to work hard.
If our letters are bad, if we want to improve it then we have to make efforts to remain very aware for a long time.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
This is also the subject of cleanliness.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We have to constantly strive to get rid of this.
Everyone has to draw attention.
We have to remember good inspirational incidents.
And I am happy that cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the past, I have noticed a very good event which I would like to tell you about.
This is the incident in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration has taken up a massive task with the participation of the people.
100-hour non-stop campaign.
What was the goal
10,000 domestic toilets in 1 gram panchayats in a hundred hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and government have successfully completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 Village ODF
I congratulate the people of the state, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district on reaching the test of hard work and presenting a great inspiration.
These days, I have been convinced of people in Mann Ki Baat, Narendra Modi is coming to the App, Mygov.
In these days, they keep on coming from letters and keep on coming from the sky.
Shri Prakash Tripathi recalled that 25th June was presented as a period of time in the history of democracy.
This awareness of Prakash Tripathis democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
15th, 25th June was the dark night that no democratic lover could forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into jail.
The opposite voice was pressed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were locked in jail.
The judicial system could not be avoided by the dreadful nature of the crisis.
The newspapers were completely dishonoured.
Today's journalists, students from all over the world, people working in the democracy, reminding the Black Black Block, constantly striving to increase awareness of the democracy and should continue to do so.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
Atal ji had written a poem when it was a year since Katkatti and he describes the mental status of that time in his poetry.
We have to further strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud by raising his head in the world today.
On 21st June, 2019, the entire world became Yoga.
From water to mountain people welcomed the rays of the sun in the morning through Yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
When people performed Yoga on The Great Wall of China in China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 meters from sea on the world heritage site Machu Pichu in Peru.
People performed Yoga in the French Eiffel Tower.
More than 400 people performed community yoga in UAE's Abu Dhabi.
India made a new wait to India's friend by practicing Yoga on Afghanistan French Dam - Salma Dam in Hairat, Afghanistan.
At a small place like Singapore, there were 0 events, and till a week, he launched a campaign.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organized at UN Headquarters.
UN officials, including diplomats from all over the world, participated in this...
This time, once again Yoga has worked as a world record.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by doing Yoga together.
I also got the opportunity to be present in the programme of Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time I had the privilege of doing Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also performed Yoga in Siachen where there are 20, 25, 40 degrees temperatures.
Whether it is our armed forces, BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, everybody has made Yoga their part with their duties.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that share the pictures of three generations of the family doing Yoga together.
Some TV channels also took this forward.
I have received several photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, Shri, I am speaking to Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Sir, I have a question that recently we heard in your statement in Kerala that we should give a good reading book in place of the gifts and flowers that we offer at different places.
You have started this work even during your tenure in Gujarat but in a few days Christ, we have not been able to see this work.
So can we do this
A day of reading and reading is celebrated for the habit of reading books, reading people, reading books.
For this, I got the opportunity to go on the occasion of its launch.
And Khadi's handloom, which also encourages Khadi.
As far as I was in Gujarat, all of us had become the same habit, but after coming here my habit had been saved.
But once again, he remembered it.
And I have just started informing the government again.
We can gradually create a natural habit.
And the cultivation of flowers is very low.
Once we have taken it in our hands, we have put it in our hands.
But if we give a book then it becomes a part of the household and becomes a part of the family.
Welcome the Khadi tower, so many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure is also reduced and it is also used in the true sense.
And when I am saying this thing then how historic is the value of these things.
When I went to UK last year, Rani Elizabeth, the queen of Britain in London invited me for dinner.
Despite all these years, Rani Elizabeth has kept the tower given by Mahatma Gandhi intact.
And when I was seeing it, it was his request that I should touch it.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I believe that the habits do not change overnight and when we talk about this, we also have to become a victim of criticism.
However, there will be criticism but if we talk about it then it will change gradually.
My dear countrymen, because of being the Prime Minister, there are several types of work.
I have to stay in the files but I have a habitual watch that I read some letters daily from the letters that I have received and that is why I get an opportunity to join the common man.
There are different kinds of letters, different kinds of people write letters.
I got the opportunity to read such a letter these days, I feel that I must tell you about it.
In the far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife from Madurai, Arulmoji Sarwan, sent me a letter.
And in the letter, he wrote that I thought of doing some economic activity in my family with regard to the study of children, which will give financial assistance to the family.
So, through the MUDRA scheme, I took money from the bank and started small work towards delivering some goods from the market.
In this regard, I was noted that the Government of India has a system called the Survey e-Marketplace.
So I discovered information about it and asked people about what it is.
Then I myself registered it.
I want to tell the countrymen that if you also get the opportunity, you should also visit the E-GeM on internet.
Those who want to supply some goods in the government, want to send small items, want to send electricity bulbs, want to send a dustbin, want to send a surveillance, want to send a surveillance, want to send a surveillance, want to send surplus, sell surplus, those who want to sell it, they can register their names in that site.
And the people of the departments of the government will also have to visit this site and will be able to see who will not be able to tie the quality of delivery.
And then they have to give orders.
Every department of the government is looking at those who have registered their names within the e-GeM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, things are very cheap.
Now the Arulmozhi Medal has registered all the goods that the government could provide on this website.
And it is a matter of joy that the letter he has written to me is very interesting.
He has written that once I got money from MUDRA, my business started, what I could do within e-GeM, and what would I have forgotten from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office has bought two thermos from me.
And I got a bill of Rs. 1600.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is Government e-Marketplace- GeM.
I would like to urge those people who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way that they will get more and more connected to this site.
I believe that this is an extraordinary example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance (Commonwealth Governance) and what is the goal of at least the price and maximum ease of functioning and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground connected with Yoga then our dreams are to overcome those horizons far and wide.
A few days ago, India has made a lot of hard work in sports and science.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 satellites with Cartosat-2 series satellite.
And this satellite includes 14 countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, USA.
And this satellite mission of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the work of farmers and in the field of natural disasters.
A few days ago, we would be well aware that ISRO had successfully launched this GSAT-1.
And this is the highest weightlift satellite in the satellites launched by India so far.
And if the newspapers of our country had compared their elephant weights then you can imagine how much our scientists have done in the space sector.
One thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on 1st June.
But I am happy that the efforts of our scientists have been successfully completed six months. And now even after one thousand days, our Mangalyaan Mission is working.
The photographs are sending, providing information and synthetic data. More than its timelines, more than its AYUSH is working.
Our scientific journey of completion of one thousand days is an important occasion in our space journey.
We also see that the interest of our youth is increasing in the field of sports.
It is now being seen that our young generation is witnessing its future in sports as well as in sports. And because of the hard work of our players, because of their hard work and achievements, the country is also named as Roshan.
Recently, India has enhanced the dignity of the country by impressing Badminton Player Kidambi Srikanth on his victory in Indonesia Open.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
Ushaji's Usha School of Athletics was an opportunity to attend the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track.
Sports personality also plays a very important role in development.
The importance of sports in the entire personality development is very big.
There is no point in talent in the country.
If our families also have interest in sports, then they should be given the opportunity to play.
They should not be forced from the fields, from the rooms, from the rooms, from the books to the books, they can also go ahead, but if they are capable of sports, then schools, colleges, family, people around them should be encouraged and encouraged.
Now everybody should dream for the Olympics.
Once again my beloved countrymen, my beloved brothers and sisters, in a way, this Kalkhand feels new.
We can never forget this year's heat.
The rainy season is waiting for us.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community, to this holy month.
Ramzan has given great importance to prayers, spirituality and offerings.
We are very fortunate in India that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can pride this thing. We can proudly proud that all the sects of the world are present in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and those who reject God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship are also residents.
Every kind of thinking, every kind of puja, every kind of tradition, every kind of tradition, we have embraced the art of living a simple life. Whether it is religion, culture, tradition, tradition, gives us the same message of peace, unity and harmony.
The sacred month of Ramzan will surely help in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again congratulate all of you.
When I was talking about Mann Ki Baat last time, I used a word and specially told the youngsters to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
Take new experiences and it is the age when life can be lived like this, you can take some risk, you can invite difficulties.
I am glad that many people have given me a favour.
Individually, everyone showed me the zeal of talking to me.
Some dramas learn, some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
My reading habit almost exhausted.
Therefore, I decided to read in this holiday.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized that how much struggle has been made to bring freedom to India, how much sacrifice has been made, how many freedom fighters have spent years in jail.
I am very inspired by the people who have done a lot in a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some message to the generation of today in this regard.
I am glad that the youth is keeping an eye on our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men, who spent their youth in prisons, laughed and laughed at the hearts of many young people.
He has endured so many crimes, and that is why today we are breathing in a free India.
One thing we must have seen that the great men who spent their time in the freedom movement had done a great job of writing, learning and their hard work.
I had visited Andaman many years ago.
The Cellular Jail was seen.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote the book "Mazi Janmatthe" in Jail.
He used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were discontinued in small cottages.
Just imagine how those people who are bent on freedom will have lost their lives.
When I read Savarkar ji's book Maji Janmatthe, I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail from it.
There is also a light and sound show, which is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India who would not have spoken any language of India, who would not have suffered his youth in this cellular jail in the prison of Andaman for the sake of independence, for the sake of black water.
Every speaker, every section of the society, every generation of the people of the country had conveyed the wishes of the British, today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I would urge the youth of the country to know what kind of evils people had to face for the freedom we have got. If we go to the Cellular Jail then we will have to know.
When we go there, we know what is the punishment of black water, if you also get the opportunity, in a way this is the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle, we must go there.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
It means connecting with nature - nurture a better planet.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
That is, the world that we don't want is our duty to worry about it and take care of it.
If you are tired and open the windows of the room, open the doors, fill the fresh air in your breath then a new consciousness comes.
When it comes in contact with the dignitaries of the Commission, a new consciousness emerges in our body.
We all have experienced this thing, but we don't mention it, we don't connect it in one corner, one instrument.
Then you must see that when you are connected with natural conditions then you will have to face new consciousness. And therefore, we should create a global campaign to connect with nature on the 5th of June.
And we are getting some benefit from our ancestors who have protected the environment.
If we protect, our future generations will benefit.
In the Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the root cause of strength.
And, in a way, the entire Atharva Veda is the biggest direction of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We say: "Mata Bhoomi: Sons Aham Prithviya: "Vedas say that the purity in us is due to our soil.
The earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is certain that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his attainment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana, had come down three trees.
But we need to connect it with modern techniques in modern words.
These days, I keep getting news from the states.
In almost every state, a big campaign of trees is being run in the rainy season.
Crores of trees are being planted.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has become the worlds famous day.
The entire world considers it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day has reached every corner, it is connecting people.
On the one hand, when many powers of division in the world are showing their bad faces, at that time Yoga is a great gift to the world of India.
We have linked the world with Yoga.
Yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul. Today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today due to lifestyle, due to racism and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life.
And it has been noticed that this situation is also coming in the young people.
Yoga has an important role to play in leading a stress-free life in such a situation, taking medicines and passing days.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through Yoga if you feel the journey under the guidance of health from yourself, from your mind, from your body, from thoughts and practices.
Just two days back, I have written to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga.
Gradually the work will progress in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day. And I appeal to all three generations of a single family to do Yoga together on the third International Yoga Day.
Whether it is Dada-dadi or small, parents or daughter-in-law, the three generations perform Yoga together and upload their testimony.
Yoga will get a new dimension if it will be so complicated tomorrow, today and tomorrow.
I thank you for this suggestion. And I also feel that as we people have launched the Selfie with Daughter campaign and a lot of fun.
These three generations of Yoga will be sufficient for the country and the world.
I invite you.
We still have three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Today we have to practice.
I will continue to post something related to Yoga from 1st June to 21st June.
I'll share with you.
You should also propagate and propagate the subject of Yoga for three weeks.
In a way, this trend is a movement of health care.
I invite you all to join it.
Because I got a very interesting phone call and I didn't think of it like this.
But I am grateful to him for the way he took it.
You will also be taken care of by this phone call.
Namaste Modi ji, I am Naina, from Mumbai.
Whether it is Surat, people have adopted sanitation collectively as a mission on your call.
The zeal that you had raised from the passage of Kashi for cleanliness has now taken the form of a movement by taking your inspiration.
Your fact is that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleanliness but during these days there is a festival of cleanliness in the society as well.
Five days prior to my visit, seven days prior to my visit, several programmes of cleanliness are being organized ten days ago.
Media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and recently I went to Kutch in Gujarat a few days ago.
You can imagine that I am very happy to know how the country and the country are taking care of these things in a beautiful way.
During my visit, the subject of cleanliness is linked, what can be a matter of happiness for me
There will be other preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
This is also a pleasure and inspiration for any cleanliness lover.
I convey my best wishes to all those who have helped in the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, the suggestions will spread a bit of rhythm.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
Modi ji, before you visit, ask those people who want to invite you, brother, if you want to invite me then how will the level of cleanliness be
The idea looked very good, but I had to think.
However, it is true that the money should be initiated so that it is better to provide other things in the form of gifts that we can supplement such tons of waste.
How many people can be prevented from becoming sick.
What kind of work will be done for humanity
One thing I would like to say is that we should not believe in waste, this is a wealth, this is a source.
This is not just a waste.
The Government of India has decided to launch a massive campaign of West Management with the help of State Governments as well as with the help of public representatives of cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, about 4,000 cities of the country will have access to solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of waste will be available, one green and the other blue.
There are two types of waste - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
If we remain in indulgence, in those four thousand cities where there is garbage, put dry waste in blue waste and put wet waste in green waste like waste, vegetable thorns, waste food, egg leather or tree leaves, all these are soft wastes and put them in green waste.
It will be remembered that if you remember the greenery of the fields then it will be used in greenery.
And the remaining waste like paper, cardboard, iron, raw, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metallurgy, and many other waste materials are called dry wastes which have to be recycled in machines.
Just a few days ago, you must have heard a news that Versova Bitch, who was considered as evil in Mumbai, has now become a beautiful clean grammar worker.
The entire responsibility was taken over by the Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV).
I convey my best wishes to Shriman Afroz Shah.
Greetings to this movement.
And the way he connected the people of the entire region like folk culture and transformed into a mass movement, this is really an inspiration.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, months, newspapers, TVs or social media, all of them are continuously following the three years of the present government.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
The period of three years has been shown on every criterion.
Every section of the society has reviewed it.
This is an excellent process in democracy.
I clearly believe that governments should be responsible in the democracy, people and people should be given the answer to their work.
This is very important for a nation, for a nation of great pride.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you and the impact of every good thing on a common citizen is similar to that of a common man.
Mann Ki Baat looks upon him as a part of a dialogue, some people also criticize him politically, but after such a long experience, when I started Mann Ki Baat, I did not think that Mann Ki Baat programme would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems as if I sit in a house in the middle of my family and talk about it.
And there are hundreds of such families who have sent me by writing these things.
And as I said, as a common man, I have an impact in my mind.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Hon'ble President, Hon'ble Vice President, Hon'ble Speaker Mahodia, everybody dedicated to Mann Ki Baat, an analytical book, as an individual, as a common citizen, this event will give me a lot of enthusiasm.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, whenever I meet you, the rain has started in every corner of the country, the weather has changed, the results of the tests have come, the beginning of scholarship will be from Navesar, and with the coming of rains, a new joy will be created in a new atmosphere.
Let us all move ahead with love and affection for nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Those who suggest that most of those who try to reach me are those who actually do something in their lives.
And when it comes to mind, I felt that this suggestion is not normal and comes out of the schedule of experience.
I had never thought that today the youth of our country has been doing this thing for a long time.
Yes, we have been aware of the fact that some social organisations have been working for years, but the youth of my country have been involved in it.
How many videos have been sent to me
There is a place where roti banks run.
People deposit chains on their behalf in this roti bank, deposit vegetables and those who are needy, they also get it from there.
Those who are given satisfaction never have to look down.
This is an example of how society works with the help of society.
Today is the completion of the month of April, the last day.
The first day of May is the establishment day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have made every effort to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the country.
My best wishes to both these states.
It was a time when the climate change was a matter of education, it was a matter of debate, but today we also experience it in the context of our routine.
Nature has changed all the rules of sports.
The heat in our country that falls in May-June has been experienced in March-April this time. And when I was receiving information about Mann Ki Baat, people have given me a lot of suggestions on what should be done during this summer.
However, it is not new, but whatever repeated remembrance is of great use at that time.
Shriman Prashant Kumar Mishra and T.
S.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern for birds.
Friends, I have seen that the small children of the family do this very well in the balcony.
Once they have to understand why this water should be filled, then it can be seen ten times a day, whether the utensils that are kept in it are water or not.
We feel that this game is going on, but it is indeed a wonderful experience of sending sensibilities into the minds of the child.
Sometimes you also feel a new joy with animals and birds.
However, in our country we talk about animals and birds, nature and colours, but it is essential that such efforts should be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I used to be a hundred years old to the brother of the religious leader of the Dawoodi Bohra Samaj.
I got the opportunity to launch it.
He distributed about 52,000 litres of liquid to the world.
He also got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
And sometimes we are so much aware that we have to send paper, milk, vegetables, postal or any other part of our organisms. However, we forget that it is the days of Garmi, first ask for water.
Young friends, I want to do some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that our younger generation is enjoying spending their lives in Asho-Ram.
Parents also rejoice in a defensive situation.
I am confident that some friends will definitely try and tell me
Would you use this time of vaccination according to my suggestion
I feel that lion or a new experience.
Try to learn new skills.
Whether you have ever seen or not, whether you have thought or not, but if you have a desire to go there then try to go there.
New place, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading about it in books or listening to the acquaintances and feeling the same thing, there is a gap between trust and trust in both.
I would like to urge you to know all your possibilities in this taxation and do a new experiment.
Whether it is really positive, if it is somewhat comfortable, do it.
We belong to a middle class family, to a happy family.
I don't say that do it again and again.
Whether it is evening, take your football or volleyball or take any means of sports to reach the poorest population.
You will get the pleasure of playing with those poor children who have never met before.
And I am confident that if you go once then you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
How many self-service organizations continue to serve.
Find out the fact that you are associated with Google Guru, 15 days and 20 days will be connected with any such organization.
At the same time, if you ever feel that you have done such a summit, you have studied the course of personality development then you should reach those people who have not got the opportunity to participate in such camps and learn them without taking the money you have learnt.
You can learn how to develop.
Every individual has become a victim of technology.
Community is also a culture, community is a power.
Today it is a gathering of greenfield.
Sometimes there is a fear that our young generation is not becoming an instrument of human robots
Efforts to spend time with yourself away from technology.
Whether it is Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati or Marathi or Punjabi, you are learning any musical instrument, you are learning 5-50 talents of a new language.
And if we look at the country full of diversity then we can find anyone in our neighbourhood to teach.
You feel like learning car driving, do you ever feel like learning auto rickshaw
You have driven a cycle but the three-wheeler cycle, those who carry it, has ever tried to run it.
You will see that all these new experiments are such a skill that will give you joy and the life that has been tied up in a dairy that will bring you out.
Do something out of boxes.
This is an opportunity to make life.
And you will think that if all the examinations are completed, if you go to the new stage of career then it will not be possible to learn.
I will tell you that if you feel the grief of learning yourself then learn the explanation of the address.
Keep showing your warmth.
I say from my experience that the world is able to learn and understand so much that we cannot imagine.
This will give you a lot of learning.
I would like to share the testimony of you when you are going.
What's new
Where did you go
You can share your experiences using 'Hashteg Incredible India'.
Dosto, this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
There is a scheme of Government of India.
If you download Bhima App, you will also be using it.
But refer it to others.
If someone connects someone else and if a new person does three transactions, if he does the financial career thrice, then you earn 10 rupees to do that.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If 20 people have been given a day, you will earn 200 rupees in the evening.
Merchants can earn money, students can also earn.
And this scheme is scheduled till 14th October.
You will contribute to making Digital India.
You will become a driver of a New India.
So income taxation and earnings.
In a way, it had become a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience says that the red light used to be on the vehicle, but it used to get stuck in the mind and the VIP culture had done a house in a humane way.
Now the red light has gone, no one can claim that the red light in the mind has gone out.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Well, he has expressed his apprehension in that phone, but today this phone call shows that the common man does not like these things.
This gives him the feeling of being far away.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am speaking Shiva Choubey from Jharkhand Madhya Pradesh.
I want to say something about the red beacon light ban of the government.
I read a line in the Newspaper that I was very proud to hear that even today my time is equally important.
I don't get stuck in traffic jams and I don't have to stop for anyone.
I want to thank you very much for this decision.
And our country is not only cleaning the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan but also cleaning the claims of VIPs from our roads.
But we have to take it out of our minds.
If all of us together make a conscious effort, we will be able to come out.
It is our concept of New India that the importance of EPI in place of VIPs has increased in the country.
And when I am saying EPI in place of VIP, my feeling is clear - Every Person is Important.
Every person has the importance, every person has the greatness.
If we acknowledge the importance of 125 crore countrymen, if we acknowledge the glory of 125 crore countrymen then how much power will be united to fulfil the great dreams.
We have to work together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we remember history, our cultures and our traditions again and again.
We get energy and inspiration from it.
This year we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of 1. 25 billion countrymen Saint Ramnujacharya ji.
For some reason, we have become so small that we think for more than a century.
For other countries of the world, centenary is of great importance.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to celebrate thousands of years and thousands of years old memories.
What would happen a thousand years ago
Very few people would be aware that Ramnujacharya ji had fought a very big fight against the evils, the feeling of humiliation, the spirit of casteism and the spirit of casteism.
The society, which was considered untouchable by his own conduct, had embraced him.
Thousands of years ago, he had campaigned for his temple entry and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every era great man is born out of our society to eliminate the evils of our society.
When we celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramnujacharya ji, there is strength in the organization for social unity, let us take inspiration from him for this spirit.
The Government of India is also going to release a stamp in memory of Saint Ramnujacharya on 1st May.
I salute Saint Ramnujacharya ji, pay homage to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is also a different significance.
In many parts of the world, it is also considered as a day of labour.
It is very natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar when there is talk of Labour.
And very few people would be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the recognition that the labourers receive today.
Baba Sahebs contribution to the welfare of workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I am talking about Saint Ramnujacharya ji, the great saint of the 12th century Karnataka and social reformer Jagat Guru Basaveshwar ji is also remembered.
Yesterday I had the opportunity to attend a function.
This was an opportunity to dedicate the collections of his son-in-law.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the labourers, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Thangdi Ji.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world celebrate the festival.
The problems that the world is passing through today are violence, war, non-violence, arms competition...
Buddha's thoughts seem to be very relevant when this environment is required.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of Buddha's journey from war.
I am fortunate that this great festival of Buddha Purnima is celebrated vesak day by the United Nations.
This year it is going to be in Sri Lanka.
On this sacred festival, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
They will get an opportunity to refresh their memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the same mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'.
And, in particular, it is also for our friendly countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 26th March, 2019
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all, most of the families in the country will be in the examination of their children.
Those whose examinations have been completed will have a very light atmosphere there and those families who are undergoing exams will still have a little concern.
But at this time, I will say that while leaving, listen to the things that I have done to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
At the time of examination, you will definitely be able to do that thing.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the day of Bangladeshs independence.
A historic battle against injustice, an unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens of Bangladesh on Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh should move forward, develop and reassure the Bangladeshis that India is a strong partner and a good friend of Bangladesh and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within the entire region.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our collective legacy.
Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize in the year 113, but also the British gave him the title of Nighthood.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were thrown into the gallows by the British. And we all know of this incident on 23rd March - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had the satisfaction of serving Mother India - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were accomplished in the spirit of India's independence.
And these three brave soldiers are still inspired by us.
We cannot describe the saga of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultan was afraid of these three young men.
The jail was closed, the furnace was fixed, but how to move forward with it, the concerns of the architects were tortured.
And it was only on 24th March, but on 23rd March it was paid.
Fancy was paid from the Stocks, which is not usually done.
And then they took their bodies to Punjab today and they were slaughtered by the British.
A few years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel the cycle of one-face on that land.
And I would like to tell the youngsters of the country that if you go to Punjab then you must go to Punjab at the place of Bhagwad Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Mataji of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when freedom struggle, its intensity and its spread continued to grow.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired many youngsters for the Armed Revolution and on 10th April, 11th, exactly 100 years ago, Mahatma Gandhi performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom movement of India, Gandhiji and Gandhiji had first appeared in Champaran.
This was a big turning point in the entire movement of freedom.
In particular, in terms of the ways of conflict, the Satyagraha of Champaran, Satyagraha of Kheda, and the heart of millions of people in Ahmedabad in the same period, the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and working style was visible.
Gandhi returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1911 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the revelation of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a man who returned to India in 1915, just two years.
Neither the country knew them nor was it their influence, it was still the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they had to suffer at that time.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that Mahatma Gandhi's organizational skills, Mahatma Gandhi's Indian society cannot preserve the drama of the Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behaviour shows a wonderful vision of consolidating, inspiring, inspiring and bringing the poorest of the poor to the struggle against the British Sultanate.
And that is why in this form we feel the fate of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think about Gandhi a hundred years ago, it is a matter of great study for Champaran Satyagraha, for any person starting a public life, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study.
We can learn from them how to initiate public life, how to work ourselves and how Gandhi did it.
And this was the time when Gandhiji, whether Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani Ji, had sent them all to the villages.
The work that people were doing with the people was to learn from the color of freedom.
And the British could not understand what is the practice of Gandhiji. Friends, struggles also go on and both walk together.
Gandhiji knew that he had made a film on two sides.
Conflicts on one side of the mosque and on the other side.
On the one hand, if you want to fill the jelly, on the other hand, you can imagine yourself in constructive works.
There was a very amazing balance in Gandhi's work culture.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be the words of disagreement, what is the use of such a great Sultanate, which Gandhi had established through a successful experiment, not by words but by words.
The desire for this transformation of 1. 25 billion Indians, the effort of this transformation is that which will be a strong foundation for New India and a New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party, nor a project.
It is a feeling that 125 crore countrymen together want to create a grand India.
125 crore countrymen have a hope, a feeling, a resolve, a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we go a little away from our minds and try to find out what is happening in our society with a sense of sensitivity, we will be surprised to know what is happening in our neighbourhood.
And they keep doing penance like a serving servant and doing meditation.
Many people go to judicial hospitals and help patients.
Many people know that they are running for blood donation immediately.
There are many people who are hungry then they worry about their food.
Our country is a multi-faceted person.
This mantra is in our blood.
If we want it once in a collective way, then we will have to know how big it is.
When it comes to a New India, it is very natural to see it with a different perspective and it is a welcome welcome to the democracy.
However, it is true that if 1. 25 billion Indians resolve, decide the path to accomplish a resolve, and if one step ahead, then the dream of a New India - a dream of crores of Indians can be realized in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things happen only through budget, government projects or government money.
If every citizen makes a pledge that I shall follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen makes a pledge that I shall fulfil my responsibilities with full authenticity and determination.
It means that every citizen follows his civil religion and follows his duties.
That is why you can become a good beginning of a New India.
My dear countrymen, I also thank you today.
In the last few days, such an environment was created in our country and a large number of people became part of the Digital Payment and Digital Movement.
How to get rid of cashless transactions has also increased the livelihood.
The poorest of the poor are also trying to learn and gradually people are moving forward towards doing business without any interruption.
Demonetization, post-recognition, there has been considerable increase in different ways of digital payments.
With the launch of the Bhim App, only two-three months have passed since then, but about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, can we move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption Can 1. 25 billion Indians resolve to do digital transactions in a year
We have announced the budget.
If they want to do this thing for 125 crore countrymen then they dont have to wait for one year and they can do it within six months.
25,000 crore digital transactions. If we have to pay a fixed fee then we will not be able to pay a fixed fee. If we have to travel by railways, if we have to travel by air then we will get digital payments if we buy medicines.
We can do this in everyday life.
You cannot imagine, but you can serve the country with this great service and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, several programmes of DGF have been organized for public education.
There is a resolution of 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have already been completed.
There was also an innovation scheme.
About 1. 5 lakh people have received this prize from the customer.
0 thousand people have received the prize for the traders.
And everyone has resolved to carry forward this work.
On 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be concluded as it was decided earlier.
After the completion of 100 days, a very big event is going to take place.
It has also been added to a large number of drones.
I am confident that whatever time we have saved Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary, we should propagate Bhima App.
We should contribute in how to reduce the cash transactions and how to reduce the transactions.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I ask people to inform you about Mann Ki Baat, all kinds of suggestions come.
But I have seen that every effort has been made for cleanliness.
I want to talk to you about my mind.
I want to say that people have to understand how important cleanliness is.
Everyday I pass by a river in which people throw garbage and pollut the river.
That river flows from the bridge of Rispa to my house.
Several people have also spoken about it, but it has not benefited from it.
And it is a good thing that the mother herself is expressing her anger and is also informing me and at the same time she has tried a lot but she has achieved success.
Awareness has started from Jaira to Swachhata movement.
Every person has been connected to it positively.
He has also taken the form of a movement.
Freedom against dirt is also increasing.
Whether it is awareness, active participation or movement, all have their own importance.
But Swachhata is associated with the habits.
This movement is a movement to change the habit, this movement is a movement to create the habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be done collectively.
The work is difficult but is to be done.
I am confident that in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth this feeling is a good result.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, those who are listening to Gayatri, I will tell all the countrymen that this message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since then, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions from the beginning and most of the people have expressed concern about the food grains.
We know that we are taking more food than required in the family and community food events.
Whatever thing we see, we take it in the plate and it cannot be eaten.
We cannot eat half of what we fill in the plate and we are moving ahead with it.
You have seen how much damage we have caused by the food we leave.
Have we ever thought that if we do not waste food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people
Any effort is being made by anyone, yet there is a social treachery on this subject.
There is injustice to the poor.
I am not asking too much on this subject but I want to raise awareness.
His life inspires us not to waste food.
The more we eat, the more we eat.
See, there are similar solutions for change.
And those people who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep a little stomach empty, keep a little plate empty.
We are also acquainted with depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally depressed.
The problem is that there are people around us but we cannot recognize them and perhaps we are confused to speak openly on this subject.
Those who are suffering from depression themselves do not even speak because they themselves feel sorry about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not a disease that cannot be freed.
There is a need to create a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of depression, there is a need for integration.
Talk openly with your friends, parents, brothers and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes there is a singularity and especially the students living in the hostels have a lot of problems.
Families are big, they are brimming, there is no possibility of depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents, however, you have seen that your daughters or daughters or any family member should have lunch with everyone and they should say that I will not be there, then you will not be there.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to stay in a group and stays in a single corner then keep in mind that this should not happen.
This is the best solution.
And depression is the cause of mental and physical illness.
Just as diabetics are hostile to every disease, similarly depression also eliminates the capabilities of sustainability, fighting, adventure and decision-making.
Your friends, your family, your premise and your wishes can stop you from going to depression and if you have gone, you can get out of it quickly.
Help with your mind, share their happiness and grief, you will feel that your inner pain will end.
If you try to understand their sorrows and do them with serving, then you will have a new self-confidence within you.
By connecting with other people, serving someone and serving in a selfless manner, your mind will be lightened.
However, Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in evading stress, free from suppression and enjoyment.
21st June is International Day of Yoga and this is its third year.
You all make preparations and celebrate Yoga festival in lakhs of groups.
If you have any information about the 3rd International Yoga Day, send me through mobile application.
The number of songs and poems that can be prepared about Yoga should be prepared so that it can be easily understood by the people.
But women have special responsibilities along with work.
He also takes care of family responsibilities and assists in the financial responsibilities of the family, which often leads to injustice to their new children.
At that time, the Government of India has taken a very important decision that these Non-Commercial Women have now been increased to 26 weeks from the previous 12 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then our children will grow up to become the value of the country.
It will also ensure the health of mothers and this will be an important decision.
This will benefit approximately 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
The life of all these great men will continue to inspire us, and will be able to fulfill the resolve of a New India.
Best wishes to all of you for this New Year are Chaitra Shakul Pratida, Year Pratida, Nav Samvatsar.
This is auspicious time for farmers to get the result of their hard work.
Nine years are celebrated in different parts of the country in different ways.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd mark)
Flowers bloom.
Not only the flowers but the fruits on the branches of the trees are seen shining in the sun.
Fruits of summer season can also be seen in monsoon season.
On the other hand, yellow flowers of mustard in the fields provide hope to the farmers.
The flowers of Kesuda indicate the arrival of Holi.
Amir Khusro has described the seasonal change moments.
Amir Khusro has written: If the flowering cycle is blossoming, Desu Foot, Koyal Bole, Dar-Dar is happy, if the weather is pleasant then the person also takes full pleasure of this season.
The festival of Bhojpanchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi enhances the colours of happiness in the lives of human beings.
In the environment of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are ready to welcome Chaitra last month.
This is a coincidence of two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of citizens of the country for the fact that whenever I ask for my suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there is a referendum.
Bhubaneswar Jal has written to me on the Narendra ModiApp that many people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO and hence, he said that I will leave 104 satellites and give some information about interceptor missiles.
Bhubaneswar, you are extremely grateful that you have sacrificed the pride of India.
Be it eradication of poverty, prevention of diseases, connectivity with the world, knowledge, consciousness or technology, science has made its place everywhere.
15th February, 2019 is a day of pride in Indias lives.
Our scientists have raised the glory of India in front of the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in a few years.
After the success of the Mars Mission on Mangal Ground, ISRO has created a world record in the field of space in the past few days.
And it is also a matter of happiness that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
This Coast Efficient Space Programme of ISRO has suddenly become a wonder for the entire world and the world has appreciated the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, this is a very important thing in 104 satellites.
CARTO SAT-2D is the satellite of India and it will be of great help in the planning of Urban Development through its driven testimony, resources mapping, infrastructure and development.
Particularly my farmer brothers and sisters, how can we use the water resources in the country, what should we take care of, this new satellite catrosat-2D will help us a lot.
As soon as our satellite has gone, we have also sent a few tests.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of joy for us that this entire campaign has been led by our young scientists and women scientists.
This enormous partnership of youngsters and women is a pride of ISROs success.
I congratulate the scientists of Israel on behalf of the countrymen.
The strength we have given to our scientists to their entire team is less.
Bhubaneswar has asked one more question and that is, India has achieved a great achievement in this regard regarding the security of India.
This thing has not been discussed in a big way at this time, but the focus of Buddha ji has been on this important thing.
India has also successfully tested the ballistic interceptor missile in the field of defence.
This interception technology missile has successfully eradicated the enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km from the ground during its testing.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that if any mission to attack India from a distance of 200 kilometres, then this mission will destroy it in space.
When we want new technology, if we get new scientific achievements then we are happy.
And biologists play a very important role in the development journey of human life.
And the unique intellectual talent that does not allow biology to remain in the form of genius, it also raises questions within them, explores new genius, creates new genius.
And this biography becomes the reason for a new discovery.
Until he gets the answer, he used to sit on his legs.
And if we ignore the development journey of thousands of years of human life then we can say that this development journey of human life is not complete.
Full time is impossible.
Efforts are being made to know the minds of Brahmanand and the rules of creation.
New science and new technologies are generated from it.
And every technology gives birth to a new era of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk of the hard work of science and scientists, many times I am convinced that our youth should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific era becomes the reason for a sustainable change in the lives of generations to come in the future.
In the past, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a very unique competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Invites Social Efficiency Innovation
I have seen how the business of identifying, displaying such findings, giving information to the people and how such discoveries work for the common man, how Jangi Manufacturing should be used.
Many times the problem also demonstrates the importance of science for solutions.
Within Mumbai, there was rains in 2005, floods in the sea, and there was a lot of difficulty, and when any natural calamity emerges then the first problem comes to the poor.
Two brothers worked very hard and worked hard on this thing. And they created a house that protects people from such a problem, saves them from water logging, and prevents them from water consumption.
And our society also becomes technology-based.
The systems also become technology-based.
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, there has been a lot of importance on digital payments.
Gradually people have come out of the hurdles and are moving forward towards Digital movement.
In India too, digital transactions are growing at a rapid pace.
In particular, the youngsters have been having the habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes to him.
In our country, the Lucky Consumer Scheme has received huge support from the DGBT scheme in the past.
About two months have passed since 15 thousand people get one thousand rupees per day.
And an initiative to make digital payments a mass movement in India by these two schemes has been welcomed across the country.
And it is a matter of happiness that ten lakh people have received prizes under the DGDAN scheme so far, more than 50 thousand traders have received prizes and more than Rs.
The maximum number of subscribers under this scheme are those who have received a prize of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a prize of 50 thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, businessmen, small entrepreneurs, businessmen, housewives, students, all participate in this scheme with enthusiasm.
Shriman Satish ji from Mysore has written on Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
But I should tell you that he has written the biggest thing.
He said, I got a prize of Rs. 1,000 and at that time I came to know that a poor elderly woman had a fire in her house.
I felt that perhaps this poor elderly mother has the right to the prize that I have received, so I gave him thousands of rupees.
You have done a great inspiration.
Everyone has been given the knowledge of this digital for all the time.
This enthusiasm keeps talking about and encourages others.
I would urge the countrymen, particularly the youth of the country and the people of this Lucky Grahak Yojana or the DJBY that they have got the prize, that you yourself be a donor.
You take it forward and it is an anti-corruption worker in a way.
In a way, you are a soldier of integrity.
You know, when the Lucky Grahak Yojana will be completed by a hundred days then on 14th April, Dr.
This is a memorable day.
On 14th April, there will be a pipeline of crores of rupees.
About forty-five days remaining.
Can Babasaheb do one thing by remembering Ambedkar
Today, the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar has passed.
You should teach at least 125 people to download Bhima App while remembering them.
Learn how the transaction takes place, especially the small traders of your surroundings.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkars Jayanti and Bhima App give special importance to this thing, so I would like to say Dr.
For the past two-three months, several townships, several villages and several cities have been successful.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic momentum of the country.
I want to tell you about happiness today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and have filled the food storage.
Record food has been produced this year by the farmers' hard work in our country.
Everything is being said that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there was such a rift in the fields that everyday it was felt that Pongal and Baisakhi are valid today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
It is also 8 higher than the last record in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented achievement.
I specially want to thank the farmers of the country.
Friends, I want to thank the farmers because they also cultivate different pulses keeping in mind the poor people of the country along with traditional crops because pulses get the highest protein by the poor.
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voices of the poor and almost one lakh hectares of pulses were cultivated on the ground.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service done by the farmers for the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way the farmers of my country worked hard to produce records by working hard on their seats.
My dear countrymen, this thing is going on in the direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations and by everybody.
In a way, everyone is seeing a conscious attitude towards cleanliness in a way.
And in the state of Telangana, not only the seminars in the closed rooms but also the significance of the work of hygiene.
On 1-18 February, the Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organized in Hyderabad.
It was cleaned by evacuating toilets of six houses and the officials themselves showed that two pit toilets could be used for reuse.
He also showed that the toilets of new technology are convenient and there is no inconvenience in cleaning it, there is no confusion, there is no psychological barrier.
And we can clean a toilet in a similar way as we can clean it in a normal manner.
And the result of this effort is that the country's attention is natural when an IAS officer himself cleanses the toilet.
And if we consider the waste of the toilet pixels clean then it is equal to a black gold.
We can see what is from Waste to Wealth.
And this has been proved.
A standard Pit Toilet for the family of six members will be filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily redirected to another pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste collected in the pixels gets completely decomposed.
These decomposed wastes are very safe in handling and are very important in terms of fertilizer.
Farmers are very well aware of NPK.
And now a special programme is being organized in Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as possible.
In the government too, various departments consider cleanliness as a puzzle.
In the first fortnight of the month of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with them, will speed up the Swachhta Abhiyan - the Ministry of Tribal Affairs Ministry.
And in the second fortnight of March, the Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also take forward the last two weeks cleanliness drive in March.
We know that whenever a poor citizen of our country does something good then the entire country feels a new energy and is confident.
We welcomed the exhibition performed by our Divyang players in the Riyo Paralympics.
In this month's Blind T-20 World Cup final, India defeated Pakistan and became a world champion for the second time.
Our Divyang friends of the country are proud of their achievements.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, steadfast, brave and determined.
Every time we get to learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
We are moving ahead with a lot of hard work and with their achievements, the country is being named as Roshan.
In the last few days, our women sportspersons won the Silver Medal in the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to all those players.
8th March is the World Women's Day.
In India too, there is an increase in awareness and sensitivity in the family and the society.
The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today, this is not just a government programme but it has become a campaign for social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added to the common man.
In every corner of the country, this huge issue has forced people to think about it and has transformed the ideas of the people towards the old ways and customs that have been going on for years.
When it comes to the news that a festival was celebrated on the birth of a child, it is a matter of great pleasure.
In a way, positive thinking towards children is becoming a cause of social empowerment.
I have heard that children have been banned under a special drive in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu.
Now more than 15 children have been prevented.
The District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand children under 'Sukanya Samridhi Yojana'.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana and efforts are being made to ensure that the children of orphaned children are being taken up by the district administration along with organizing the Gram Sabhas.
Under the Har Ghar Dastak programme in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run for the welfare of children from village to village.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to re-inspire and re-school the children who had been drop-out by running your Buchcha Apna Vidyalaya campaign.
It means that the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has transformed this movement into several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New imaginations are linked to it.
It has been raised as per local requirements.
I consider it a good sign when we celebrate the Women's Day on 8th March, we have only one feeling.
My dear countrymen, you have got the opportunity to discuss something on various occasions in Mann Ki Baat.
I get a lot of information from you.
What is happening on the earth, what is happening in the minds of the village and the poor is reaching me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
We celebrated several festivals in the last few days.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary was celebrated in entire India.
And everybody can find solutions to the present problems from the life of Sweden.
There is a feeling of innovation in every aspect.
And therefore, when I talk to you today, I look forward to two moments.
Thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohammed used his intellect, his ability and his thoughts in order to avoid the conflict.
And also chose Charkhadhi Mohammad as one such path. And for the people of human values, for the sake of ensuring the basic elements of the individuality, for the sake of liberty, for the sake of liberty, we have given this kind of approach to the freedom struggle.
Whether it is the significance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of moving ahead with laughter in life, all these things can be learned from the message of Lord Shiva.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for a bigger festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but in the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new dimension to human history, established new records.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way he has become a part of his life.
Mahatma Gandhi was always present for service whenever needed.
He not only gave importance to service but also emphasized on the spirit of service associated with it.
We can understand this in a very good way from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, society, humanity and humanity were the same.
Be it Finnics Farm in Africa or Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram, or Wardha Ashram, in a unique way, he stressed on social inclusion, community mobility.
I am fortunate to be here that I have got the opportunity to salute and visit several important places associated with the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi serving was also emphasizing on organizationalism.
Social service and social reform, community service and community mobilisation are the feelings that we can remove in our lives.
In the true sense, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
My dear countrymen.
And the community has its own strength.
All these programmes of Gandhi Sahityabandh should also have collectivity and service.
Why don't we come out with all the moments
If we have a football team, we will have a football team, but we will also work together in line with Gandhi ideals.
We can gather old books and distribute them to the poor and spread knowledge.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore enterprises.
Whether it is compassionate, honest, honest, and serving with complete dedication, it is also done for the sake of self-reliance, a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had buried in Gujarat.
Satyagraha of salt in the freedom struggle, Dandi is a very important turning point.
I inaugurated a very modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi of Dandi.
I urge you to visit one of the places associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
They can have any places.
Whether it is Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Ashram of Wardha or Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And also write two-four articles expressing your feelings.
Several programmes, competitions and exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But in this context, one thing is very interesting that I want to share with you.
Venice is a well-known art programme called Venice Bienel, which is collected by artists from all over the world.
This time a very interesting exhibition related to the memories of Gandhiji has been held at the India Pavilion of Venice Biennial.
In this, the testimony of Haripura was particularly interesting.
You must be recalled that the Congress office in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected the Speaker, is also involved in the history of the event.
Gandhiji wanted him to show the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and exhibition of his art work.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose calamities enhance the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And his artefacts have made Nandlal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and then made some artworks depicting the lives of rural India.
There has been a lot of discussion in the Venice of Anmul Kalapanis.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I look forward to making a pledge from all the Indians.
For the country, for the society, for the sake of any misery.
You must be reminded that in the last few years, we have launched the same mission of cleanliness in the country for nearly two weeks before the second October.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
We will come out of the house of our grandparents and pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi through labour.
Whether it is home or street, chowk or drain, schools and colleges, we will run a mass movement of cleanliness at all public places.
This time special emphasis has been laid on the plastic.
Similarly, we have to work together to eradicate the use of a single-time plastic.
On October 2 this year, when Bapu will celebrate his 150th birth anniversary, we will not only dedicate him to Open Defecation Free India but will also lay the foundation stone of a new folk movement against plastic in the entire country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to the residents of every village, small towns, to join hands and pray that this year we should celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way as a free from plastic waste.
Celebrate 2nd October as a special day.
On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti, a special labour day will be celebrated.
All municipalities, municipalities, district-rural systems, rural panchayats, government-ruled systems, all organizations, single citizens, all of them, I urge all to make proper arrangements for collection and disposal of plastic waste.
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come forward and dispose of all these plastic wastes.
It can be recycled.
This can create energy.
This is the way we can fulfil the work of safe disposal of waste by this day.
Bus resolutions are required.
There is no need to see an atmosphere for inspiration.
How can there be greater inspiration from Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is a well-defined form of knowledge.
We can get whatever we want in life.
My contact with them has come down recently.
But earlier my contact was very high.
Today, I want to touch a very important thing with a Sanskrit description.
And these are the things that have been written centuries ago, but how important it is today
It is an excellent description and it is said: Please commemorate Trinity Ratnani, Jalam Annam Subhasitam, Mudhai: Pashankhand Ratn Sankranti Presently, it is three rituals of water, food and well-defined earth.
Rocks are called Ratan.
There is a lot of food in our culture.
Until then, the knowledge of food has also been changed into science.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and new children, as they are the foundation of the future of our society.
People are fighting against corruption in new and interesting ways.
Once upon a time, one thing was brought in my mind.
There has been a big movement in Nasik.
In this, Anganwadi workers collect grains during the days of crop yield.
This grain is used to make fresh food for children and women.
The person who donates it becomes a well-known citizen and a social worker.
After that, it is also dedicated to this objective and it becomes a symbol of this movement.
All of us have heard about the food processing in the vicinity of India.
When we start feeding the child for the first time, this is done.
This is a very beautiful initiative which can be adopted.
In so many states, people run Tithi meal campaigns.
If someone in the family has a birthday, a good day, a memorable day, then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food, and the family members themselves serve children, feed them, share their happiness and enhance happiness.
There is a unique combination of serving and joy.
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as a nutrition campaign across the country.
I had never thought that I would become a place in the hearts of our country and the youth of the world.
I didn't think of how many diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to.
I had never thought that there would be any opportunity in my life to touch the youth of the world.
And I went to Bhutan last week.
I have seen that as Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to go from Jaira to Jayer. And this has become such a situation because of International Yoga Day.
Shekhawari has organised this programme in 165 countries in her language.
I am confident that this APSOD will help in making the world aware of all these things, the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in Indias cultural journey.
And now people want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But one more interesting thing is that some people ask me with confusion that Modiji said that you used to speak Hindi and beer grills don't know Hindi, then how would you have been talking to you so fast
Or later, the audit has been done.
He asks very wisely.
Yes, there is no secret in this.
If there is a question in the minds of so many people, then I will declare it as a book.
However, it is not a mystery.
In fact, technology has been used immensely in interaction with Beer Grills.
In the ears of Beer Grills, a small coordinate apparatus used to be used in English.
However, I used to say Hindi, but it used to be English and due to this the dialogue became easier and this is the use of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing the Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife nature and other creatures.
I have said before and I am telling you loudly, I want to visit Ishaan Bharat in your life.
Your inner world will expand.
On 15th August, from the Red Fort, I urged all of you to visit at least 15 places in India in the next 3 years.
It is also 100 tourist destinations. See, study, take family and spend some time there.
You will also fill these diversities with diversity in the form of a teacher.
Your lives will expand.
Your thinking will be broad.
And keep in mind that there are such places within India that you will come here with new zeal, enthusiasm, new inspiration and new inspiration.
Your family will also be convinced.
My dear countrymen, the environmental care and anxiety of India is natural.
Last month, I had the privilege of declaring tiger population in the country.
You know, how many tigers are there in India
A resolution was taken while expressing concern over the decreasing population of tigers in the world.
The resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India that we have conceded the goal in the past.
We doubled the lives of the tigers in 2017.
In India, the number of tigers, Bulkes, reserved areas and community reserved places has also increased.
When I was announcing the people of the tiger, I also remembered the lions of Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister, the residence of lions in the wilderness of Gir was being confined.
Their number was decreasing.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In 2000, it was decided to constitute women's guards there.
Infrastructure reforms to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about defence.
But now you have to move ahead of defence and also think about the composition.
There has been a lot of good guidance in our sciences.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic address of Swami Vivekanandji on September 11, 183
The young sannyasis of India, who ridiculed the entire world of humanity, had left India's brightest identity in the world.
The way Swami Vivekanandji had seen India, Swami Vivekananda ji had enlightened Indias capabilities, let us resolve to live it.
We have everything inside us, let us come out with confidence.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that August 2 is celebrated as the nations sports day.
On this occasion, we are launching Fit India Movement- Clean India Campaign across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you, on 2nd August, in Fit India, in the nutrition drive in the month of September, and especially in the cleanliness drive from 11th September to 2nd October and for complete dedication offensive on 2nd October.
Let us come out with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
My dear countrymen, today this is the same thing in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll meet again.
I will wait for your thoughts and your suggestions.
Come, let us all come together to make India the dream of freedom fighters, to realize Gandhi's dreams - Swantah: Sukhaya, the joy of the distance from service to service.
Namaskar.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, the importance that is given to the rights at all times, the same importance should be given to the taxpayers.
Indias democracy can move forward at a rapid pace only on two steps of authority and duty.
Yesterday is 30th January, the legend of our venerable Bapu.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping a two-minute silence at 11 a.m.
In the form of a society, as a country, on January 30, at 11 o'clock, there should be a feeling of compassion for 2 minutes.
Why not only 2 minutes, but it should also show respect for community, resolution and martyrs.
In our country, there is an easier respect for the army and the security forces.
I convey my best wishes to the brave soldiers and their families on the eve of this Republic Day.
The awards consist of several categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishva Seva Medal, Special Service Medal.
I want to especially urge the youngsters and you are very active in social media.
You can do one thing. The heroes who have received this honour this time - look at the net, write two good articles related to it and spread it among your colleagues.
We are surprised, proud and inspired when we are aware of their courage, bravery and valour.
On the one hand, we were all happy to know the zeal and enthusiasm of 26th January, and at that time the soldiers of our army in Kashmir who were engaged in the service of the nation were brave because of the violence.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers, I salute them.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I continue to do Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April, all these months are the months of Kasauti for every family.
The house is tested by one or two children, but the entire family is buried under the supervision of examination.
So I was convinced that this is the right time that I should talk to students friends, talk to their friends, talk to their teachers because for many years, the examination was a very big problem.
A strange atmosphere is seen in the households like family welfare, student welfare, educational distress and every home.
And I always feel that we should get out of it and that is why today I want to talk to young friends in some areas.
When I pronounced this topic, many teachers, girls and students sent me a message, sent me a question, expressed their pain, expressed their thoughts and thoughts in my mind about those things which I want to talk to you today.
I have received a telephone message from the world.
So I want to ask you so much that cannot be happy
The question has been asked by the Creator but this question will be in everyone's mind.
The test must be an opportunity of happiness on its own.
It should be a festival of fervor and enthusiasm that has been laboured throughout the year, which has now come to be shown.
There are very few people for whom the examination is pleasant, then the examination is a pressure for most people.
We have to make decisions that you will be happy or stressed.
The happiness that will be accepted will be achieved and the pressure that will arise.
And that is why I believe that examination is a festival, examine the exam in such a way that when there is a festival, when there is a festival, then the best thing that happens within us comes out.
The strength of the society also takes place on time.
We generally feel that we are so proud, but if we look at the arrangements for the Kumbh that lasted for 40-45 days then we can see what is wrong with the Make Shift Arrangement.
This is the strength of the festival.
Even during the examination, there should be a festival in the entire family and friends in the neighborhood.
You will see that this pressure will be reflected in happiness.
Festivals will be free of burden.
And I would like to urge the parents here to create a festival for three-four months.
We all have the obligation to celebrate these three-four months every year by understanding our tradition and understanding the environment of our family.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you see yourself relaxed, you will easily be relaxed.
A year ago, the entire scene will be remembered by the teachers in the classroom.
And you should know that the strength of re-collection of memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you are in stress then all the doors are closed, the outer does not go inside and the inner can not come out.
The thought process stops, which becomes a booze on its own.
You must have seen in the exam that you remember everything, the matter is remembered, the leaflet is remembered, the leaflet is written upwards, the leaf is also remembered.
Why didn't it be remembered, there was pressure.
However, the person who was inside immediately came out and it came out that you were relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall the memory then it is relaxation.
And I am saying this on the basis of self-confidence that if there is pressure then we forget our things and if there are relaxes, we have never imagined it and suddenly we remember things that are very useful.
And it is not that you don't have knowledge, you don't have information, you don't have to work hard.
But when there is a tension, your knowledge, your information is curtailed and your tension is fulfilled.
And that is why it is essential that A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the exam in the right perspective.
It seems as if it is a question of life-style.
The test you are going to give is a test of what you have studied throughout the year.
It is not your lifestyle.
There is no test of how you lived, how you lived and how you lived.
In your life, there must have been an opportunity to pass through the crises other than the tests given by you in the classroom.
And that is why we should get rid of the burden of testing with the success of our lives.
Our former President Dr.
A.
J.
Abdul Kalamji is a great inspiration.
Something has sent me a question: In today's era, if I can see the biggest challenge in education then it is that education has become centred.
uality has become the most important.
This has led to a lot of competition, as well as stress in students.
I want to know your thoughts about this current direction of education and its future.
However, he himself has answered, but he wants me to present my speech here too.
Marks and marksheets are very limited uses.
There is nothing in life.
Life runs on how much knowledge you have achieved.
Whether you have tried to live with what you know or not, lives on it.
The sense of mission that you have received is of ambition, whether anybody is getting involved between your mission and ambition or not.
If you rely on such matters, then the marks will come out and you will not have to run behind the marks.
You will have knowledge, skills, self-confidence and will work in life.
You people have told me that there will be a doctor from your family and every family member will go to him who is a family doctor.
There is no one among you who has asked his family doctor how much he had passed it.
No one has asked.
Just, you felt that brothers and sisters, it is very good as a doctor, you are benefiting and you have started serving them.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case then do you see the mark sheet of that lawyer
You see its experience, its knowledge and its successful journey.
And that is why these qualities which are emphasized sometimes stop us from moving towards the right direction.
But this does not mean that I am saying that it is not just studying.
Its use is essential for our defecation.
I was yesterday and today it is important to know that I am here.
Sometimes it happens and if you look at your own life from close by then it will be noticed that if you fall behind the qualities then you will find a short way, you will get some favorite things and focus on it only.
But if you concentrate on the qualities, then gradually you are confined to yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get a mark.
And it is possible that despite being a hospice in the examination, sometimes there is a failure in life.
Chaucha ji also said one thing - competition.
This is a very big song.
In fact, competition does not work to move forward, it is a competitive task to move forward, and when I meet, it means to compete with yourself.
How to stay better tomorrow from tomorrow
A special feature of the life of most successful players is that they compete with them.
Let us take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Friends, When you are being tested in every sphere of life then think that if you can study peacefully for the first two hours then you can study for three hours .
Shriman S.
Sundar ji has expressed his passion for the role of the brides.
He said that the role of women in the examination is very important.
He has written more - My mother was not married, yet she would sit with me and tell me to be familiar with me.
Because mothers are punished about the future of the households, they are active, they make things very easy.
Once you learn to accept, most of the problems will be solved there.
Everybody would have experienced this thing.
They are in the root of the problem as compared to the teachers.
Acceptance opens the way for solutions to problems.
The expectations make it difficult.
Accepting the situation gives an opportunity to open a new path.
And therefore accept what is there.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask a single question about his talent.
What is the situation there, what is the disease, what is the situation there, what is the disease.
The technologies began to emerge and in the first two-four minutes, the weather was lightened.
We often drive them away from the disease by going to the sick person.
I would like to tell the villagers that sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought that during the days of examination give the child the atmosphere of laughter and grief
You see, the weather will change.
I have received a call from a Kamal.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot mention my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
And when I tried to pass through it, I got caught in it. And because of me, many of my close friends have faced a lot of difficulties.
You must have heard this many times, don't worry, don't steal.
I also tell you the same thing again.
Once there is a habit of stealing, there will never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
If you read the entire creativity of this kind of time in the preparation of the exam then perhaps you will not need the nucleus.
My first question is: Can we reduce the pressures that arise during our exams and my second question is: why don't we feel light or not thank you
If we want to develop inclusively then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn.
Anyone says that I will take all these tests beforehand, then I will do it.
So it is impossible.
The remaining parts of the body should also get physical activity.
Have you ever thought that when there are so many things in front of you, you should come out for two moments and take a look at the sky, take a look at the trees and plants and take a little bit of your mind.
By doing so, you will come back in your rooms and your books with a joy.
Whatever you are doing, keep it for a while, get out standing, go to the kitchen and find out what your choice is, if you get a future biscuit.
Why not just five minutes, but take some brakes.
There is no need to stay closed in any room for deep breathing .
Go under the open sky, go to the awakening, take a deep breath for five minutes and then sit back to study.
You will feel that the body will become very light and the body will not only become light but will also make the brain light .
Some people feel that we will wake up till late at night - we will read more and not yes.
Definitely take as much sleep as the body needs.
It'll be okay.
There will be a lot of increase in your efficiency.
Whenever I hold meetings at the time of election, sometimes I get hungry.
I got a folk singer.
He came and asked me - How many hours do you sleep
He gave me a herb.
In fact, if we understand the significance of these things then we will benefit.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping .
Without doing so, the people of your family will be disappointed with me.
And you will not be able to see the day your mark sheet will come.
This is a very big medicine for keeping the mind, intellect, body cautious.
But at the same time I will also say that do not let the emphasis on what I have said.
So I also feel that the way I advise your family not to become a bogey for your parents.
Remembering your resolve, trust yourself, go for examination.
My best wishes.
Please make a celebration to overcome every problem.
Then there will never be any crises.
Take this mantra forward.
Dear Countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years in February 2019.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and officers of the Coast Gardens for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among the four largest Coast Guards in the world with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in the country.
Last year, the people of Coast Gardens, along with their responsibilities, had launched a massive campaign to clean the seashore of our country and thousands of people joined it.
And very few people will be aware that not only the men in the Coast Guard but also the women in our country are equally responsible for their responsibility.
The Coast Gardener is also an Observer of our women officers, and also holds the Honor Craft.
Today, when the issue of maritime security is being created all over the world, I congratulate them on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard engaged in Indias maritime security.
1st February is the festival of Champaran Panchmi.
Spectacles have been accepted as the best season.
There is a queen of monsoon seasons.
Opportunity of learning is celebrated.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the brave.
Mara Rang de Basanti Chola - this is inspiration.
I congratulate my countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Panchmi.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani also fills new forms with its imagination.
Since last month, he has started talking about mind in regional languages immediately after finishing my mind.
It has got a comprehensive approval.
People are writing letters from far flung places.
I congratulate Akashwani for this self-inspired work.
My best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is the occasion to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I believe that the poor dont want us to accept that St. Luke has written in the Gospel that Lord Jesus has not only served the poor but has also addressed the service provided by the poor and that is the true empowerment.
There is a time related to this which is very popular.
It is said in the story that Lord Jesus was standing near the clan of a temple.
There were many immense people and they gave a blanket.
After that, a poor widow came and gave two coffins as a donation.
If we go to see that two copper copper copper copper copper copper copper copper is not called a very big donor.
It was very natural for the devotees present there to have a feeling of fervor.
My dear brothers and sisters, Issu said that this woman has made the highest contribution because all others have given a lot of donations but this woman has offered her all the contributions.
Today is 25th December, the birth anniversary of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya ji.
Malviya ji, who brought about a resolution and confidence in the Indian public, gave a new direction to modern teachers.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development projects in the Tapobhumi Banaras of Malviya ji.
At BHU in Varanasi, Mahamam Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre has been honoured.
The Cancer Centre will be an important contribution not only to the people of eastern Uttar Pradesh but also to the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Ratn and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have honoured the nation by achieving inclusiveness in the field of nuclear energy.
Whether it is the leader of the party or the member of the parliament, the minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji has established an idealism in every role.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray to God for his good health.
I got the privilege of working with Atal ji as a worker.
Several memories are swimming in front of them.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift, the countrymen will get the benefit of two schemes.
In other words, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
In the entire country, whether it is a village or a city, whether it is educated or educated, what is a cashless business, how can it be purchased without cash
Everyone wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this, two new incentives for the Government of India, customers and small traders are going to be started from today so that mobile banking becomes more robust.
In order to promote one scheme customers - Lucky Consumer Scheme and another scheme for the promotion of traders - Digitization Trade Scheme
Today, as a Creams gift on 25th December, 15000 people will receive prizes from the Drug System and one thousand rupees will be filled in the accounts of 15000 people and this gift is not limited to just one day of today.
Everyday 15 thousand people will receive a prize of one thousand rupees.
In 100 days, lakhs of families are required to receive crores of rupees but this prize will be made only when you use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USD (USSD) and drain on the basis of this digital payment.
In addition to this, there will be a one-day large draw for such customers, including prize money for lakhs and three months later, on 14th April, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be a bumper drone with a prize of crores.
Digitization Trade Scheme is mainly for traders.
The traders themselves will join the scheme and also connect the customers to make their business cashless.
Such traders will also be given a separate prize and this prize will be in thousands.
The traders will also have their own business and will also get a boost of prizes.
This scheme has been made by keeping every section of the society, particularly the poor and the lower middle class at the centre. And that is why people will get the benefit of this scheme if they buy anything above 50 rupees and purchase less than three thousand rupees.
More than three thousand rupees will not get the benefit of this prize.
The poorest of the poor can also use USSD to purchase goods through featured phones, ordinary phones and sell goods and make payments and every person can become the beneficiaries of this scheme.
In rural areas too, people can buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win the prize.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this prize scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and the youth around you will definitely be aware of this and you can ask them and they will definitely understand you.
Your family will also have children studying in the 10th-12th standard, they will also be able to easily learn this.
This is very simple - the way you have sent a voice-up message from mobile phones, this is the easiest thing.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to do e-payments and how to do online payments.
In the last few days, cashless trade and cashless trade has increased by 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
This decision is so big that the businessmen can apply properly.
Such traders have been exempted from incompetence by the traders who have made digital transactions, who will develop online payments in place of their trade barriers.
Everyone has taken this campaign forward in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shriman Chandrababu Naidu has appointed a Committee headed by Shriman Chandrababu Naidu, who is considering several schemes in this regard.
However, I have noticed that several state governments have started and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Government of Assam has decided to give 10 discount on the digital payment of Property Tax and Trade License Fee.
The rural banks which will have at least two digital transactions of 5 of their subscribers in the period between January and March will receive Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
As on 31st March, 2019, villages having 100 digital transactions have been announced on behalf of the Government to give a prize of Rs. 5 lakhs under the Uttam Panchayat for Digi Transaction.
Under the Digital Agricultural Shiromani for the farmers, the Assam Government has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5,000 to 10 farmers, who will be able to fully utilize digital payments for purchase of secondary and fertilizer.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Assam and to every government that has started this auspicious occasion.
Several institutions have also made several successful experiments to promote digital procurement among the poor farmers of the village.
I have come to know that the GNFC-Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited, which is mainly fitting the farmers, has purchased 1,000 POS machines where they are sold and 35 thousand farmers have been given 5 lakh fertilizers through digital means and this work has been done in the last two weeks.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our lifestyle, informal sector is very big and most of the people are required to spend money in labour, work money or money in cash. And we know that this is the reason why labour is being spent.
Wherever they get 100 rupees, they get 80, they get 50, and there are other facilities in the health sector like insurance.
But now the cashless payment is going on.
Rupees are being deposited directly in the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the corruption is being stopped, it has also been closed and it has become possible for the workers, the workers and the common man to complete the work.
He is also entitled to other benefits of Sathosath.
Our country is the country of the youngest.
We have got technology easier.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress from startups.
This digital payment is a golden opportunity.
Our youth should make this sector as strong as possible with new technologies, with new technologies and with new vision, we should also join the campaign to bring the country free from black money and corruption.
The people of large sections of the people of many other writers have taken note of the fact that such good work, the work of the country's pleasure, the work of such a sacred task, however, however, the people have also mentioned about the way new roads are being explored for the wrongdoers.
And the third step is that in which people have supported this thing, but the fight should be carried forward, corruption and black money should be eliminated, there should be more serious steps for this thing, such enthusiasm and writers are also there.
I am grateful to the countrymen that all these letters have helped me.
Mr. Gurumani has just written on Mai Gov - This step to focus on indefinite money is appropriate for appreciation.
We are being harassed by the citizens, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy with the support we are supporting in this fight.
We are fighting against corruption, black money etc. like the tributaries. The same thing that Gorumani Kelly ji has written is emerging in the brink of the nation.
We are all feeling it.
But it is also true that when people are suffering, if they are suffering from difficulties, then who is such a person who is not suffering from pain
I feel the same pain as you have.
However, for a better purpose, for a higher purpose, as soon as the work is done with a good intention, the countrymen remain firmly in the midst of pain and grief.
Indeed, these people are the people of the transformation.
I also thank people for another reason that they have not only made troubles, but have given answers to certain people who are trying to blame the people.
It is also going to be repeated that somebody has spread the flaws, some spellings written on the note, somebody has said that the price of salt has increased, somebody has to spread the flaws, somebody has to file a note of 2000 and even the notes of 500 and 100 are to be filed.
I also salute this power of the people for hundreds of years.
My dear countrymen, I am explicitly experiencing that as soon as the millions of countrymen are with you, nothing is impossible.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country, I salute them that people have participated in this magnificence of corruption and black money.
There will be widespread discussions in the Parliament House for the political parties as well as for the political parties.
If the Parliament was going on, it would have been a good discussion.
Those people who are spreading famine, all the political parties are wrong.
Those who cannot support open corruption and black money have been searching for the government's faults all the time.
This government is for the masses.
The government is constantly striving to imbibe the people.
On the other hand, I had earlier said on the eighth day that this fight is extraordinary.
How powerful are the possibilities associated with black money and corruption for 70 years
Whenever I have decided to meet such people, those people also adopt a new scheme to defeat the government.
I want to convey my heartiest congratulations to the brave countrymen.
How did this become possible
I told him his sign.
The book is that I am getting all these information from the people.
More than the information received from the government machinery, a number of prominent citizens are getting from the citizens and most of us are getting success because of the awakening of ordinary citizens.
Can the awakened citizen of my country imagine the danger being raised to open such elements
And most of the information that is being received is getting success.
I am confident that the government has given an email address for this thing that you can also send on this kind of request.
You can also send it to Maygov.
There is also a third group of people who write letters, which is also in great numbers.
He says: Modi ji will not get tired, will not stop, and whatever steps he has to take, but once he has taken the path, he has to reach Manjil.
I am extremely grateful to all those who write such letters because there is a faith in their letters and blessings.
And if you want to return to the work for which the blessings of crores of Indians are blessed then there is no question.
We have taken it out and we have enacted a very strong Benami Property Act.
In the coming days, the law will also work for itself.
Our priority is to do whatever is required for the country and for the welfare of the people.
My dear countrymen, even in Mann Ki Baat last month, I had said that even in the midst of these difficulties, our farmers have broken the records of last year by working hard.
This is a good sign in terms of agriculture.
Be it the labour of this country, the farmers of this country, the youth of this country, the hard work of all these people is bringing a new color today.
In the last few days, at the world's economic forum, India has made its name very glorious in many fields.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
In the World Innovation Index 2016, we have achieved 16 positions and improved the World Banks Transport Efficiency Index of 2016 by 1.
There are several reports which have also been evaluated in this direction and India is moving forward at a rapid pace.
The President, the Vice President also condoled the loss of lives.
However, there are some good things in such a concert, and then the mind gets a great satisfaction.
An excellent work has been done between the Hobala of the Parliament, which has not been noticed by the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I feel very proud and very proud to say this thing that a legislative parliament related to the campaign of Divyangjan was passed by my government.
I also thank all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to Divyangs.
I have also tried to make it more sensible by taking it in a human way.
I mean, the Divyangjans get their rights and respect, which they are entitled to.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and responsibilities at a time when they won four moonlights in the pyramids.
He has not only enhanced the dignity of the country but has also surprised the people by his own capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, we have an invaluable heritage and can be valued.
I am extremely happy today that Divyangs will have more opportunities for jobs after passing these laws in the interest of Divyangjans.
For them, the limit of reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides for redressal of education, customs and grievances of Divyangs.
You can imagine how sensitive the government is for Divyangs that in the last two years the central government has conducted four thousand three thousand three hundred fifty camps for Divyangjans and has distributed aid to 5 lakh 80 thousand Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs. 352 crores.
The Government has passed a new legislation in the spirit of nation building.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we have come to know from the field of sports that has made us proud.
It is very natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four years in the England Resistance category.
The work of some young sportspersons was desirable.
The investigation was conducted by Virat Kohli, along with a good beating, as well as a good leadership.
Indian Cricket Team off-spinner R.
Ashwin has been declared the best cricketer and best test cricketer for the year 2016.
My best wishes to all of you.
In the field of hockey, after fifteen years, good news came.
Our junior hockey team called the World Cup.
After fifteen years, there has been an opportunity that the Junior Hockey Team has won the World Cup.
I congratulate the youngsters for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also made a mistake.
India's women hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days back, India's women hockey team won a concert in the Asia Cup for under 18 years of age.
I heartily congratulate all the players of the Cricket and Hockey Team.
Last month, all of us were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year, on this occasion of Diwali, I once again crossed the border of China to celebrate Diwali with my dear brothers and sisters.
I have celebrated Deepawali at the height of the Himalayas with the departure of ITBP and the army personnel.
He was filled with emotions and not only did the countrymen send a message of goodwill, it was a wonderful expression that the security forces of the country were involved in their happiness.
And people didn't just send a message, they were connected with their minds.
Someone made a video i.e. almost every household had become a checkpoint of soldiers.
And whenever I saw these letters, I was also surprised to see how imagination is, how many impressions are filled and from this mygov thought that we should make a copious book of some favorite things.
The work is going on.
With the contribution of all of you, the imagination of everyone about the sentiments of the soldiers of the country - the feelings that you have towards the security forces of the country will be integrated into this book.
But the truth is that this time it did not happen.
This time it did not seem that there is a festival and I am not at home.
It seemed as if we are also celebrating Diwali with crores of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases by 125 crores.
A few days ago, I had visited all the Sarpanches of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with such affection, these Sarpanches of the villages have touched my heart.
I urged them to go and concentrate on the future of those children.
Today, I am happy that all those Sarpanches from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promises made to me.
Just a few days ago, when the board was tested, about 95 percent of students from Kashmir and students from Kashmir participated in the board examination.
The involvement of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education for a bright future.
I congratulate him for his enthusiasm, but I congratulate his parents, his volunteers, his teachers and all the village sarpanches.
My dear brothers and sisters, whenever I ask people to inform people about Mann Ki Baat, I can say that the suggestions of everyone have come in one direction.
Everyone used to say that we should talk about 500 and one thousand notes in the region.
However, on 8th November, at 8 o'clock in the night, while addressing the nation, I had talked about launching a massive campaign to bring about reforms in the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal and it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is its implementation.
And I was supposed to have to face many new problems in our common life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take fifty days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
The diseases that we have been facing forty years cannot be easier to prevent diseases.
I can understand your difficulties and challenges in a good way.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation, many efforts are being made to disguise you, sometimes the incidents that disturb the mindset, you have understood this path of truth and have accepted this thing of the countrymen in a very good way to stop the notes of five hundred and thousand.
And this huge country, such a large number of notes, intelligent notes, and this decision-making decision-making worldwide, every economist is analyzing and evaluating it very well.
The entire world is watching the fact that the people of India will be able to overcome the difficulties and challenges of crores of Indians.
There may be questions in the minds of the world.
India has only faith in millions of Indians and millions of Indians, it is believed that the resolve of crores of Indians will be fulfilled.
And our country will be expelled and expelled in every way like gold. And this is the reason why you people are the citizens of this country.
The path of success has also become possible due to you.
Over one lakh bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night in central government, state governments, local bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches.
In the midst of various kinds of tensions, all these people have worked very quietly for a great transformation by considering it as a philosophy of service to the nation.
When it starts in the morning, it will never be known at night, but everyone is doing it.
And this is the reason that India will succeed in this thing.
And I have seen that all the people of the Bank and the Post Office are working in the midst of such difficulties.
And if we talk about humanity then they see two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an elder brother was struck in the ruins.
Suddenly money was needed.
It was a matter of great happiness for the local bank employees and I was very happy to know that they themselves brought money to their homes and old people so that they can help in the treatment.
In such cases, countless cases come out everyday in TV, media, newspapers and conversations.
I am extremely grateful to all my friends who have worked hard in this magnificence.
Shakti can be pursued only after crossing the toilet .
I clearly remember that the campaign for the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was going on and the way the Bank employees took it on their shoulders and showed the work that was not done in the seventeenth year.
Today, once again, he has raised this challenge and I am confident that the resolve of crores of Indians, the collective strength of all, will make this nation a new strength.
They are searching for guerrilla roads to save their money.
The sad thing is that in this too, they have found ways by using the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing any work with them.
I would like to tell such people today - whether to improve or not to comply with the law, whether to comply with the law or not, your law will see what to do.
Please do not waste the lives of the poor.
You don't do anything so that the name of the poor comes on the record and afterwards when there is a check, my dear poor people get stuck in trouble due to your sin.
And there is such a stringent law of Benami wealth that is being implemented in this regard, it will be very difficult and the government does not want our countrymen to face any problem.
My name is Ashish Pare.
I am a common citizen of Tirali Village, Tirali Taluko, Harda districts, Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say several examples in Mann Ki Baat that people have welcomed this crucial decision for the upliftment of their nation despite inconvenience, which will enhance the enthusiasm among the people and I am with the whole country that the cashless criterion is very important for nation building.
I am very happy that you have stopped the notes of thousands and five hundred.
I call Yelpa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I want to thank you because you said that good days will come, but no one thought that you would make such a big decision.
Five hundred and thousand notes, black money and corruption have been received.
Every citizen of India will never be better than this.
I want to thank you all for this.
Some things are known through media, through people and through government sources, the enthusiasm of working is greater.
It is a matter of great pride that the common man has a unique potential in my country.
If you go to the ground and get a chance to pass through these roads then you must pay the money.
And when people go there, they go there and after two-four days they go back then they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country, which has the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to discuss the issue in the election and had reached this point all over the world.
The people of many countries of the world have also learnt to speak words on 'Chairperson'.
But I didn't know that there should be a marriage in the discussion on the issue.
I came to know that on 17th November, there was a marriage in Surat that took place in discussion on the issue.
In Surat, Gujarat, a daughter gave tea only to those who came in marriage and did not spend anything else.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar who have contributed to this fight against black money through their marriage will inspire them.
When I was late at night, I used to watch TV, I saw in the news that there is a small village named Dhekia Juli in Assam.
There are tea garden workers and they get money every week.
What did he do if he got a note of Rs 2,000
Four women of the slaughterhouse gathered together and shopped all around and paid two thousand rupees, they did not need a small note because they bought it all together and decided that when we meet next week, we will sit and watch it.
People are searching for their paths.
And also see the change.
The people of Assam's tea gardens are saying that we have put ATMs there.
See how the lives of the villages are also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefit from this campaign.
The country will get benefits in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each municipal corporation gets about 2050 tax rates.
However, due to this eight-day decision, all the people ran for depositing their old notes.
47 urban units were taxed at about three to three thousand crore rupees last year.
You will be happy to know that 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the same week.
Now it is natural for the poor people to have gutters, water supply and Anganwadi arrangements.
There are several such examples in which it has a direct benefit.
Brothers and sisters, Our village and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new transformation of the economy, every citizen is making arrangements for himself amongst the difficulties.
In the midst of the difficulties, the farmers have found ways.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which the farmers and the villages have been given priority but still there is a problem but I am confident that if there is any problem in the farmers, if there is any problem in them, if there is any problem in them then it will continue to be obstructed this time too.
The small traders of our country, who also employ, also increase economic activity.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that the small entrepreneurs of the villages like Mall will now be able to do their business for twenty-four hours, no law will stop them because I believe that if the big mall gets 24 hours then why shouldn't the poor entrepreneurs of the villages get it
A major initiative has been taken to provide loans to them from Mudra Yojana.
Millions and crores of rupees have been delivered to the small people through Mudra Yojana because a large number of people do small businesses, and boost the business of billions of rupees.
However, it is natural for them to face difficulties due to this decision.
You should also download the bank accounts in mobile phones.
You should also set up a POS machine for credit card, you should also learn how to do business without a note.
Technical routes are safe and quick.
I would like you to help in making this campaign a success and not only lead your transformation but also lead you. I am confident that you can lead your transformation.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the entire village business.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a paradigm on paper and when it comes in hand then it is different.
Sometimes, if there is a sufficient salary then sometimes it has to be given a portion of something outside and it makes a part of life in labour force.
With this new system, we want you to be in the bank as well, your payments will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are complied with.
Nowadays, your mobile phones also work as e-packets. You can also get the money from the mobile phones that you have to buy from the small shops of Adosh-Padesh.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become participants in this scheme because I have taken such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the labourers, the deprived and the victims of which they should get the benefit.
Today, I specially want to talk to the youth.
We guide the world and say that India is a country with 65 of the population below 35 years of age.
Young and youngsters of my country, I know that my decision must have been chosen by you.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you are also contributing sufficiently to take this forward.
But Dosto, you are my true sister, you are my true friend.
We have got an extraordinary opportunity to serve Mother India and an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
Can my youngsters help me
You will tell me, you will not stop talking so much.
The kind of experience that you have in today's world is not that much for the old generation.
You cannot know the elder brothers in your family and parents, poets and maternal uncles.
You know what the app is, what online banking is, you know how online booking is done.
All these things are very common for you and you also use them but today the country wants to do a great job, our dream is 'Kashlas Society'.
Hundred percent of the cashless societies are not possible but do India start the 'Lace Cash Societies'
Once we start the Less Cash Societies today, the model of the Cashless Society will not be far away and I will see your time and your resolve.
And I am confident that you will never let me alone because we all want to change the lives of the poor people of India.
You know that there is a lot of opportunity for digital banking or mobile banking for cashless society.
Each bank offers online access.
E-packet is the direct content of the voltage.
Several types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have a card of Rs.
The poor have started using RuPay cards and it has registered a growth of around 300.
In the same way, printed cards are available in mobile phones and printed cards are also available for spending money in banks.
It is a good platform that you can also send money, money and it is easy to do as you have sent on the website.
How to send messages to Vote Apps, it will be an uneducated person.
Not only this, technology will be so easy that there is no need for a big smartphone for this purpose.
Every bank has also been added. And now the cost of online surcharge has also been abolished and misappropriation of such cards has also been noticed by them that in 2-4 days every expenditure has been abolished in the newspapers so that the cashless societies can get a boost.
My young friends, even after all, there is a complete generation that is unfamiliar with this.
And as much as I know, all of you are active in this great task.
As you have sent a Creative Message on WhatsApp, I have been watching all these things like slogans, poems, films, cartoons, new imaginations. And when this creativity of our youth is in the midst of such difficulties then it seems that this is the specialty of the land of India that the song was born in the battlefield of a time, in the same way we are passing through such a massive transformation, then there will be moral creativity within you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, I once again say that I need your help and I am confident that crores of youngsters of my country will do this work.
Please do one thing and resolve from today that you will yourself become a part of the 'Cashless Societies'.
All the technologies that you have to spend online on mobile phones are available.
Moreover, what is the technology for at least 10 families, how to use technology, how to download the app of their bank, how to spend the amount of money that has been spent in your account
Whether the investors can be trained or how to do business
Your vision is to lead the Cashless Society, the Maha Abhiyan, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to provide black money, the campaign to free people from problems and difficulties.
Once people are taught how to use RuPay cards then the poor will bless you.
If the common man learns this system then perhaps he will get rid of all the concerns. And if all the youth of India get involved in this work then I dont think it will take longer.
Within a month, we will be able to grow as a new modern India in the world and you can do this through your mobile phones.
You can go to 10 houses everyday and add 10 houses to it everyday.
I invite you, come, not just support, we will be the army of this transformation and will be transformed.
We will carry forward this struggle to free the country from corruption and black money. And there is a country where the youth of the world has changed the lives of this nation and the youth who bring changes, they bring revolution and revolution.
M-PESA used the technology of such a mobile system, named M-PESA and today almost the entire business has come up in this area of Africa.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge you to carry forward this mission.
I invite you to do this work in every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, collectively.
We will take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the best of the country, which is not to miss the opportunity.
Dear brothers and sisters, today is the day of the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country, Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachchan ji and today on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Shriman Amitabh Bachchan ji has given a slogan for this cleanliness drive.
It must have been seen that the most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji, is taking forward the cleanliness drive very well.
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has reached his nascence and at the same time he remembered the work of cleanliness on his birth anniversary.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
So his son, Shri Amit Bhaji, who is running a mission of cleanliness in his nascence, has sent me through the use of Harivansh Rai ji's poetry.
I respectfully salute Harivansh Rai ji.
I also thank Shri Amit Bhai for joining Mann Ki Baat in such a way and taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings and your letters keep me connected with you on MYGOV and Narendra Modi App.
Now at 11 o'clock there is a mind-set, but immediately after that we start in regional languages too.
I am grateful to Akashwani, the new initiatives taken by those people so that even my countrymen from where Hindi is not popular will definitely get the opportunity to connect with it.
Thank you very much for your service.
Those who see from far flung places seem to be the second name of the Indian Jan Bhawan Festival and it is also natural.
Festivals that have been a tradition of India since Vedic times have been a festival of timely changes.
We have seen the importance of finishing the tradition of external festivals from time to time and the changes in festivals as per the demands of society have also been easily accepted.
And it should be done through this festival.
All these things have been covered by our ancestors in a very scientific manner.
Today, the entire world discusses the environment and has become a matter of concern for naturelessness.
The festival of India is a tradition of strengthening the love of nature, it is for every individual to take it from the child.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody has a feeling of responsibility.
Nowadays we are residing on Sundays, but the people of the older generation, the labourers, the fishermen etc.
So far, we had developed a tradition of keeping Brahmanand and science together.
Today, as we celebrate the festival of Deepavali, as we say, every festival of ours is an educational festival.
We are well aware of the fact that going to any corner of India, going from Amir to Amir's house, going to the huts of the poorest of the poor, and on the occasions of Diwali, cleanliness drive is seen in every family.
The household is cleaned.
But the need of the hour is that not only the cleanliness of our house but also the cleanliness of the entire complex, the cleanliness of the entire village and the entire village.
We have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Deepavali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
In all the countries of the world, the festival of Deepawali is remembered and celebrated in some form.
Many governments and parliamentarians of the world have also started becoming part of Deepawali festival.
Whether it is eastern or west, whether it is a developing country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, all these things are visible on the occasion of Diwali.
You must be aware that the US Postal Service has also released the postage stamps of Deepawali.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his photos on Deepawali.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom organised a programme on the occasion of Deepawali in London on the occasion of Deepawali.
And what is Tasvir
16 women MPs from Singapore are wearing Indian swords outside Parliament and these photographs have been viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
The festival of Deepavali is being celebrated in every street of Singapore.
The Prime Minister of Australia, while conveying the greetings of the Diwas to the Indian community, called upon all communities to join the festival of Deepawali in different cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand came.
He told me that I have to return so much that I have to attend the festival of Deepavali. I mean that the festival of Deepawali, the festival of this light, the world community is also becoming an inspiration to lead the light from darkness.
On the occasion of Deepavali, along with good clothes, good food and drinks, there is also a huge surge of crackers.
And children and youth are very happy.
No matter what has happened in the vicinity .
During the days of Deepavali, news of accidents, news of anger and misconceptions are causing serious concern.
And it also happens that in the days of Deepavali, doctors have also gone to celebrate their birthday with a large number of parents.
The festival of Deepavali is very long in our country.
It is not just a day.
In a way, it has been going on for a long time as Govardhan Pooja, Bhaibija, Benefits Pancham and Kartik Purnima.
At the same time, we also celebrate the festival of Deepavali and also prepare for Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja in the eastern parts of India is a big festival.
But it has a special feature that it gives immense messages to the society.
But the truth is that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshipped.
There is a very big social message in this festival...
I talk about the festival of Deepawali or speak of Chhath Puja, this time I wish you all the best wishes.
But at the same time there is a special time for me.
I want to express my gratitude to the countrymen, especially to the countrymen.
In the last few months, the incidents that have been taking shape, our soldiers have been looting their lives for our well-being.
My dear countrymen, the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the armed forces continues to flourish on the world.
And one thing was left in mind to dedicate this Deepawali to the defence forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called Message to Soldiers.
But today I want to say that there is no such person of India who has an unprecedented love for the people of the country, the way it has been expressed, it gives strength to every countryman.
We cannot imagine for the soldiers of the peacekeeping forces.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, businessmen, politicians, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons or sportspersons, who have not produced lamps for the country's soldiers, have not given a message for the country's soldiers, the media has also changed this lamp into the opportunity to express gratitude towards the army and why not
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Jal Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard, I cannot call everyone's names, but what kind of difficulties do we face with these unconscious soldiers
I can imagine this moment of pride for my countrymen.
There have been so many acts on the Message to Soldiers' Hashtag, in a competitive way or what to say.
I want to read a poem by Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chouhan.
Such a sister Shiva has sent me a telephone message, what do we call a family like this
Namaskar Prime Minister, I salute Shiva.
Our fauji brothers are getting a lot of encouragement from the message to solvers campaign launched on this occasion.
I belong to a weak family.
My husband is also an officer of Shreshkar.
Both my father and mother-in-law have been the officers of the armed forces.
Our entire family is full of passage.
I want to say that their families, their wives, along with the personnel and soldiers, also make such sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are not only on the border but also on every aspect of their lives.
Whether it is a natural disaster or a crisis of law and order, whether it is a bond of enmity or a bond of hatred, whether it is an adventure for the youth who are on the wrong path, our youth continues to work with inspiration from the feelings of the nation on every aspect of their life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh has become Open Defecation Free (Open Defecation Free).
Now Himachal has also been formed and the first new Kerala is going to be formed.
But how can this success be seen
Now the youth of our ITBP had gone to the village on their duties.
So, perhaps the village had to meet the village council at that time and it was being discussed in the Gram Sabha and the toilet was being constructed.
It was learned that some families could not make toilets without any money.
And his patriotic vision was not like that he used to serve the nation only when he used to lay pills on enemies.
He extracted thousands of rupees from his checkbook and gave it to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those who did not have toilets in 5 houses, give one thousand rupees to every family, make 5 toilets and make all our villages open defecation free.
I am really grateful to the youngsters.
I noticed that there are no roads in the far flung jungles of Kerala which can be reached with difficulty all day long.
It is difficult to reach Idmalakudi, wherever people were not there, the students of engineering in the nearby urban areas noticed that this village is going to build toilets.
Candidates of NCC, youth of NSS, students of engineering, all together decided that we will build toilets.
These youngsters, who had to carry toilets, cameras, cements, all the goods, took up their pockets and walked on foot to Pela Jungle.
He himself built toilets in the village and these youngsters created an open defecation free village in remote forests.
This is the reason that Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat has also declared all municipalities - municipalities, perhaps more than 150 open defecation free.
10 districts have also been declared open defecation free.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee in the first New Year and he has decided that within a few months, the entire state will be freed.
Till now, he has completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I convey my best wishes to the citizens of all these states for joining this great task and for contributing in the task of eliminating the indomitable darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of schemes in the government and if there is another good scheme in line with it after the first scheme then we have to leave the first scheme.
However, there is no focus on these matters in general.
Old projects are also underway and new projects are also underway and the next project is also waiting.
This is going on.
Those households which have gas connections in our country, those households which have electricity, do not need carosins.
And I have heard that seven or eight districts have been freed from kerosene in the current year.
I am confident that the entire royalty will soon become kerosene-free.
And peoples convenience will also increase, yes, it will be difficult for the intermediaries, it will be difficult for the criminals.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide to all of us.
Everything, how should the country go And even today we decide the criteria for all these things.
Gandhiji used to say that if you prepare a scheme then first of all, remember the poor and the weak faces and then decide what you are going to do, whether it will benefit the poor or not
You decide on this parameter.
The need of the hour is to satisfy the hopes of the poorest of the country.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problems.
Whatever our ancient thoughts may not be, the society must be freed from the discrimination of daughter-in-law.
It is no longer possible that the 21st century and the village is simple.
And that is why the Maha Abhiyan is progressing successfully to make the villages free from darkness and to provide electricity to the villages.
Time is moving forward in limits.
After so many years of independence, what will happen if the poor mother cooks cooked cooked cooked cooked cooked on wooden plates and sucks 4000 cigarettes in her body
Five crore such families have been successfully moving forward to provide a life free from smoke.
They used to remain trapped in the midst of the business of small businessmen, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk-keepers, swine floaters, and those who used to live in the midst of the behaviour of the martyrs.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 31st October, the great personality of this country, who created the mantra of his life, lived and showed it.
31st October is a celebration of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb and the lives of the people of the country's unity.
On the other hand, there is also the legend of Smt.
We should not only remember the dignity of the great men but also do it.
But I was touched by the sound of a decorated Punjabi phone, his pain, Prime Minister Narain, sir, I am speaking Jasdeep.
From Punjab, Sir, you know that Sardar Patel's birthday is on 31st December.
Sardar Patel is such a vision that he has brought his entire life to the nation and he feels that he has succeeded and brought everyone along.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, a Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, is a witness to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done the mission of uniting the country after Chanakya.
A successful effort to bring down the freedom struggle, the great work that we have done in such a big way, is the last moment for the great man.
But it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb was alive for unity, he was humiliated for unity, because of his priorities of unity, he was also hunting for so many defeats, but never left the path of unity.
It is not only the birth anniversary of the great man who lives for the sake of unity but also the birth anniversary of Sardar ji along with Sardar ji.
But in the midst of this crisis, we have to take forward the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of this country.
There may be many languages, sexes, dresses, food and drink, but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
The root cause of unity is the strong foundation of a better India.
Sardar Sahebs life journey started with a struggle for farmers.
He was the son of the farmer.
Many of us have heard the name of Amul.
Every manufacturing product of Amul is now known to people outside India and India.
However, very few people would be aware that it was the vision of Sardar Saheb who had imagined the cooperative milk producer association.
And he emphasized on the idea of Kheda district, which was called Kera district at that time.
As a result, today's Amul is a living example of how Sardar Saheb had created happiness and prosperity for the farmers.
I pay my respects to Sardar Saheb.
And on 31st October we must remember Sardar Saheb and resolve unity.
My dear countrymen, this series of festivals of Deepavali is also a celebration of Kartik Purnima (Devali).
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings are guiding not only for the entire human race, but also for the entire human race.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony.
When we were at the bottom of the disorder of the hustle-bustle, creed, hungry, then Guru Nanak Dev was chosen as his colleague.
If we move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas', then who can be our guide
I salute Guru Nanak Dev as well as his birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, once again the name of the country's soldiers is Deepawali, this Diwali also greets you very much.
Thank you very much.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir in the last few days.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
The entire country was sufficient to make this fiery.
There is also grief and anger in the country. And this wrong thing has not happened to those families who have lost their sons, brothers and sisters.
My dear countrymen, we are dependent on our army.
We are proud of our army.
We have many opportunities to speak to citizens and politicians.
But the army is not speaking, the army is showing sympathy.
Today, I want to talk to the people of Kashmir as well.
The citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the opponents of the country.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have come out on the path of peace by embracing such elements with them.
Every parents want the school-colleges to work as fast as possible, the farmers are also feeling that the crops, fruits etc. have been developed in the markets across India.
Economic activity also runs well.
And in the last few days, the caravan has started to run well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the solutions to our problems, the path of our progress and the path of our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will solve every problem by sitting together, finding ways and at the same time paving the way for the future generation of Kashmir.
The peace of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that regime.
The administration has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
And we will fully follow it.
Sometimes people who think the Jews also present new ideas with what we think.
I get a lot of opportunity to know about the recent social media.
Every section of the country has the opportunity to understand, understand and understand the feelings of every kind of people. And it strengthens the strength of democracy.
In the last few days, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th standard has given me a different kind of idea.
He has written, I was very surprised after the Uri terrorist attack.
And what can a small student like me do
From these, I felt that how did I work for the country
And I resolved that I will study 3 hours a day.
The country can become an appropriate citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of joy for me that you can think healthily at such a young age in this environment of anger.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country is very big.
This is a symbol of national consciousness.
But you might be aware that when the battle of 165 was fought, Lal Bahadur Shastriji was leading us and there was such a spirit in the entire country, it was a cycle of patriotism.
Everybody, everybody, everybody wanted him to be a joke to get rid of him.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried his best to touch this feeling of the country.
And he inspired the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, and inspired the people of the country how to work for the country.
Red Bahadur Shastri ji had said that one more path of patriotic expression between the voices of Bomb and Book is for every citizen.
When Mahatma Gandhiji was also running the freedom movement, the movement was at its pace and there was a need for a stability in the movement, then he used a very successful experiment to embrace the intensity of the movement towards constructive work in society.
And if we all fulfill the responsibility of the army, the people present in the House, and if we make a constructive contribution in the spirit of patriotism, in the spirit of patriotism, in the spirit of patriotism then our country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the players who had gone to the Paralympics have created history and their identity is in the spirit of humanity.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has written to Shri Varun Vishwanath on the App that our sportspersons have done a very good job and you should mention this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only this, but every person of the country has had an emotional connection to our players of the paralysis.
Perhaps we have moved forward from sports to paralysis and our sportspersons, to the perspective of humanity, to our attitude towards the Divine.
This is a very big power in the field.
This time, 1 sportspersons, including 3 women from our country, participated in the Paralympics.
As compared to other sportspersons, physical talent, sports skills are more important than all.
He won the Golden Jubilee Celebrations at the Debendra Jhazaria Bhalafang, and won it again after 12 years.
The age increases in 12 years, and after winning the Golden Jubilee, the spirit also decreases significantly.
However, Debendra said that the condition of the body, or the increasing age of the age, could not weaken his resolve, and again after 12 years he brought the golden chain.
And he was not Divyang from his birth.
He had to lose one of his hands due to electrification.
Just imagine, the person who will get the first Golden Jubilee at the age of 23 and gets the second Golden Jubilee at the age of 35, how much he has done in his life.
He won the Golden Jump in the high dock.
Thangavelu lost his right foot at the age of just 5 years.
Poverty too did not come under their control.
He neither lives in a big city nor comes from a middle class Amir family.
Despite passing through difficult situations in the age of 21 years, the country has been lit by determination in the midst of physical difficulties.
With the name of Deepa Malik of sportsperson, the pride of sportspersons has been added.
Varun C.
Bhati received a bronze medal in a high school.
This is not only the greatness of the moons of the Paralympics, but in our country, in our society, in our country, in our country, in the direction of our divine brothers and sisters, these moons have done a great job.
Our sensibilities are not only a place but our attitude towards this divine world has also changed.
Very few people would be aware of how these Divyangjans have performed in the paralysis of this time.
A few days ago, the Olympics Competition was held at the same place.
This time it has been created.
The 1500 meter race in which the Olympics Competition was held, the Golden Chain Regulators distributed the Vikram from Algeria's Abdellatif Baka distributed a new record of 1500 meters in the competition for Divyangs from less time to time.
Moreover, I was surprised that the fourth number of Divyangjans did not get any moonlight from the racist race, but they also ran in less time than those who won the golden silver in the race for ordinary runners.
Once again, I congratulate all of our sportspersons. And in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a supplementary scheme for paralysis and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a lot of experience in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was an emotional moment for me.
A Mega Camp was organised by the Government of India for Divyangjan and it was established in a large number of world orders.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to dedicate a book that has stored the successful stories of some Divyangjans.
There were very inspiring incidents.
I consider it important to have a world record on the land of India and Navsari.
Within eight hours, a successful experiment was carried out to send machines to ears to listen to Divyangjan who could not hear them.
It was found in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to establish three world cycle by the Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Pujay Bapu on the second October.
And on that day, I had said that cleanliness should be our nature and every citizen should be obliged.
I can assure you that there has been an increase in awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of crores of countrymen.
Today, we all can say that everybody has tried to move forward one step ahead.
That is, the country has moved ahead with crores of steps towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is correct.
Its fruits are so good, what is happening with some such effort has also been seen.
Whether it is a bus station, railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, everyday, from children to adults, villages, poor, farmers, women and all are contributing sufficiently to the cause of cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
However, we still have to go a long way.
For health, for the honour of the citizens, especially for the honour of the mothers and sisters, there should be a ban on open trees.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be able to achieve full success in the near future in terms of open defecation.
Recently, when I went to Gujarat, the officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the goal of ODF completely on this second October.
I want to present a scheme especially for young friends who are using technology today.
And that is why the Government of India has given a telephone number - 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
You can not only know the condition of building toilets in your city by calling on these 16 numbers, but you will also be able to make toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Moreover, a Swachhata App has been launched to find out the situation of sufficient grievances and disposal of grievances.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Fellows in the districts.
This cleanliness drive will not be possible even if it remains confined to Sanskrit.
Cleanliness is not enough.
It has been started from the government's policy time to enhance the waste.
The fertilizer companies have been asked to purchase the compost-centrial fertilizer from waste.
And the farmers who want to go to their livelihoods get this assurance.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, worry about the health of the earth, and want to stop the damage done due to chemical fertilizers, if the farmers need such fertilizers in a small quantity, then the companies will assure them.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
I also invite youngsters to develop new start-ups in waste to waste, waste to waste to waste, to develop such equipment, to develop such technology, to manufactur its gasoline in affordable manner.
A special programme - Indo-India Swachhta Summit is also being organized from 25th September to 2nd October this year.
The Ministers, the Chief Ministers, the Mayor of the Mahanagars, the Commissioners, all of them have to contemplate only in depth on cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
What can be the economic infrastructure
How can the participation of people be done
How can the employment opportunities be increased in this
All subjects are to be discussed.
And I see that a new awareness about cleanliness is coming up.
Recently, one day I read in a newspaper that students from Gujarat Technological University went to 10 villages and started awareness campaigns to build toilets.
He himself worked and contributed in making about a thousand toilets.
A few days ago, you must have seen that under the leadership of Vingkamandar Param Vir Singh, a piece of pilgrimage from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar, travelled 2800 kms and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a full year Keylander Time Paper in their respective departments.
Each department will focus on 15 days specially on cleanliness.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development are scheduled to work together to increase sanitation in the field of hygiene in the coming October from 1st to 15th October.
And during the last two weeks of October 16 to 31st October, the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs, Department of Food Processing Industries, these three departments will run a sufficient drive for 15 days.
You must have seen that the campaign for cleanliness is also going on at present.
Earlier, the report of the situation of cleanliness was presented to the people of the country by surveying three cities.
Now the 500 cities of the country with more than one settlement have a legacy. And because of this every city has a belief that we have left behind, but we will do something better next time.
This is a competitive environment of cleanliness.
I hope that all the citizens can contribute in this campaign.
The next October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been going on for two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I urge all of you to buy Khadi.
This time too, I urge that every family should have a cheese of Khadi so that the walls of the poor can be opened in their homes.
On the other hand, as soon as it is Sunday, how can we connect ourselves with the work of cleanliness
If you have a video, send a video.
If our efforts across the country will once again give a new impetus to this movement.
Remembering the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to make our country favourable.
And I have seen that the responsibilities that I had given to my countrymen in the past are a very inspiring event in the national life of India.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers had come out in the shelters and the families used to ask for the old rituals and those who were serving used to beat the poorest of the poor areas.
He was happy to see the poor kids with a pellet.
Today, the centenary year of Pandit Deendayal ji's centenary is beginning with the work of interpreting political think-tanks, political think-tanks and philosophy that lacs of workers like me have been working on political think-tanks, the philosophy of politics related to the roots of India and the efforts to reward Indias cultural heritage.
Sarvajan Hitaya - SarvajanSamyojana Antyodaya is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the people of Howrah.
How can the poor man get the fruits of development
They gave all the work, every farm, water and two words of economic work.
We can liberate the country from poverty only when the country considers its birth centenary year as a poor welfare year, when it focuses on the benefits of the development of the society and the welfare of the poor.
As a part of this, the Prime Minister's residence and the path that was known as the Rescuers Road of today's British, has been named Lok Kalyan Marg on the occasion of the birth centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
This is a symbol of the poor welfare year of this century.
My dear countrymen, I had started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
I have been convinced that the Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to measure the works of the government.
How can the human being of this country inspire me
Is this the hopes and aspirations of the common man of the country
The way Mann Ki Baat admired and amended this week, I express my gratitude to all the devotees for the way they blessed him.
I am also grateful to Akashwani, who has not only spread these things but also made every effort to reach them in all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who have written letters after Mann Ki Baat and made a publication on the flaws of the government. And Akashwani gave a special programme on these letters to the representatives of the government and provided a platform for the problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue but it is becoming a new opportunity for social change.
For any other reason can there be a bigger satisfaction than this
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durgapuja, the festival of Vijayadashmi and the preparations of Deepawali are in a way a different kind of atmosphere throughout the country.
It is a festival of unlimited resources and the unity of the society can be achieved by the country.
Whether it is a navaratri or a Durga Puja, how can it be a festival of fervor of the unity of society
How to create a festival connecting human beings
And that is why we can easily celebrate the festival of victory by making it a means of righteousness.
Come, let us take the mantra of unity and let us move forward.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 28th August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Nalanda is the birth anniversary of Dhyan Chand ji of Hockey on 2nd August.
This day is celebrated as the National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chandji and also urge you to remind yourself of their contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in giving India a golden hub of hockey in the 128th, 132th, 136th Olympic Games.
We also know the name of CricketPrime and Breadman.
He said for meditation, High Scores Goal Like Runs, Dhyanchandji Sportsman Spirit, and a living example of patriotism.
Once upon a time, during the match in Kolkata, the player of an opponent team kicked me at Dhyan Chand ji's head.
There was only 10 minutes left to complete the match at that time.
And Dhyanchand ji had made three mistakes in ten minutes and said, I have changed the injury.
But I have seen that this time, on a large scale, everyone urged me to talk about Rio Olympics.
I see it positive to take the ordinary citizen to such an extent, to create such awareness and to put pressure on the head of the country or speak on it.
Besides cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, there is so much awareness and so much knowledge.
Reading this message for me also became a source of great inspiration for me.
Please speak to the daughters of Mann Ki Baat on their participation in education and sports as they have glorified the country by winning a medal in the Rio Olympics.
Some Shriman Sachin writes, You are requested to mention the Sindhu, Prayag and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
These daughters gave us the moonlight.
Our daughters once again proved that they do not descend from anyone.
One of these daughters is from North India, one from South India, one from East India.
Someone is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of the whole of India have taken the lead in making the country proud.
The summit on May Gov has written that we have performed better in the Olympics.
He has written, Hon'ble Modi sir, Congratulations for winning two medals in the first rayo, but I want to draw your attention to the fact that was our exhibition really good
And the answer is: No.
We need to spend a lot of time in sports.
Our parents are still asking to focus on sugarcane.
Even today, sports in the society is considered to be a time-long vendetta.
We need to change this idea.
Society needs inspiration.
Thus, thousands of people have expressed this sentiment.
No one can deny that we cannot undo our hopes.
It has also happened that the exhibitions that our players used to perform in India, the sportspersons who used to play here could not even reach there.
And only two medals could be found in the field of medicine.
But it is also true that even if the moon does not meet then for the first time in many sports, the Indian sportspersons have shown great skills.
But why can we forget that it is the first Indian girl to qualify for Olympics and for Olympic Finals
This is what happened in a similar tennis with the combination of Sania Mirza and Rohan Banna.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babar made a claim for the Trek Film Final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, women hockey teams have reached the Olympics.
India's players will certainly be good for us.
Aditi Ashoka, Dadu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do the same thing then we will be able to do it again.
I have announced a committee.
We will make a map of how we can do better.
Think of how the prince likes one of his two games and how he can perform excellent exhibitions.
I also urge the confederations associated with sports, that they also negotiate with the passionate spirit.
And I appeal to every citizen of India that whatever is interested in it will send me a suggestion on the Narendra Modi App.
Write to the government.
The association will give its dues to the government in consultation.
The State Governments will discuss and send their suggestions.
But we should prepare ourselves completely and I am confident that 65 of our countrymen, out of which 65 are young, will be able to achieve a better position in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, this is the 5th September Teacher's Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with the students on Teachers' Day for many years.
But for this time I had to go to the G-20 Summit so I had to express my heartfelt condolences.
And we have seen teachers who are more concerned about their students than themselves.
He dedicates his life to his disciples, to his students.
Nowadays, after the Rio Olympics, Bullela Gopichandra ji is being discussed.
He is a sportsperson, but he has presented a vivid example of what is a good teacher.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on the Teacher's Day, I salute Pulla Gopichand ji for his penance, his dedication to sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
Teacher's contribution is always felt in our lives.
The former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnan ji and the country considers it as a teacher day.
He may have reached that place in his life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
He always used to say - good teachers are those who don't die anymore.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has lived a life of such a wonderful life, despite the presidency of the President, living as a teacher and surviving the inner students as a teacher.
I think I remember a lot of things from my teachers because he was our hero in our village.
But today I can enjoy that even if one of my teachers is 70 years old, even today his letter comes to me every month.
And that is why if I look at any of the good letters then a lot of respect is born in my mind.
It is our responsibility to enhance the pride of our teachers in the society.
You must present your photo with your teachers on Narendra Modi App, if there is any inspiration for your teachers.
It is also very valuable to see the contribution of the teacher in the country with the eyes of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganeshotsav will be held in a few days.
Ganeshji is legendary and we all want that the life of our country, our society, our family, every person remains intact.
But if we talk about Ganesh festival then it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh festival is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now every corner of India is not just Maharashtra but also a public Ganesh festival.
The NITI Aayog holds competitions and colourful competitions.
Even in their exhibitions, the issues that touch the society are highly artistic.
This massive campaign of public education runs through the Ganesh festival.
Surajya is our birthright, let us now proceed to Surajya, become our priority. Can we not convey the message of this mantra through a public Ganesh festival
Come, I invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are not possible for the society.
This time many people have sent me a lot of writing Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Why not use the idol of Ganeshji made of mud of the village pond
The idols made of POP are not unique to the environment.
This is also the service to protect the environment, to protect our rivers and rivulets and to protect these small creatures.
Ganesh ji is a widow.
We should not create a Ganeshji that produces a word.
I don't know how you will take these things in your own way, but I don't just say this thing, many people say it and I have heard about many things - a sculptor is Shriman Abhijit Ghondfal.
An unparalleled Ganeshotsav is also a social service to the environment.
There is still time for Durga Puja.
Today, we decide that old family that makes idols.
If we buy a statue from them, they will also get employment and if these statues are made from the soil of the pond or river then they will be able to get it again.
My best wishes to you all on the Ganesh festival.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred with Saint Upadhi on 4th September.
Mother Teresa dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of the sages who have served the poor of India throughout their life.
In the event to be held on 4th September, the Government of India will also send an official delegation to the forefront of our foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj.
We have to learn something from the saints, saints and great men every moment.
Let us keep getting something, learn something and keep doing something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then how big a change comes.
Jansh Kit is considered to be the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect people with the help of five State Governments, for clean Ganga, for Ganga Safai.
On 20th of this month, Sarpanches of the village on the banks of Ganga were invited to Allahabad.
The village should not let the river Ganga be washed away, it came from Uttarakhand for this resolution.
Someone came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody came from Bihar, somebody came from Jharkhand, somebody from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India, who have fulfilled this imagination. I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step towards the elimination of the Ganga by connecting the people.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me very much and I also have special respect for those who have got their imagination.
On 15th July, in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh, more than 100 students from the school collectively wrote letters to their parents.
Children from seven to seven years of age have done this work.
Congratulations to the students who made this effort and special congratulations to the parents who took their children seriously and made toilets.
There are things that inspire us.
In the Koppal district of Karnataka, a hundred year old daughter Mallama paid tribute to Satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become a dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have resolved.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
But everyone is connected to it in some way, everyone is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about how new efforts are being made.
A thought has been made in the Government of India and he has urged people to make a film on cleanliness for two minutes, three minutes and send it to the Government of India.
You will get details of this on the website.
It will be competitive and the victory on Gandhi Jayanti on October 2 will be rewarded.
I also tell the channels that you too should compete for such films.
Creative - creativity can also give a boost to the cleanliness drive.
New ways will be known, new inspiration will be there and all this will be done by the common artists with the participation of the people.
It is not necessary that there should be a big studio, a good camera to make the film.
A very important thing has happened in the past.
Our Hon'ble President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitri Channel - Now some people will have to say, should the President inaugurate a radio channel
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
On this side, Akashwani Maitri and on the other side, Bangladesh Better will share their mutual commodities and the Bangladeshi people on both sides will enjoy the skyscrapers.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate Akashwani's friends that they are also contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you might have given me the work of the Prime Minister, but if you do, I feel like you too.
And sometimes incidents touch me even more.
These emotional incidents also provide new energy and inspire new energy, and this is what inspires the people of the world to get rid of them.
In the past, I received a letter which touched my heart.
He wrote this letter to me, about 84-year-old mother who is an retired teacher.
If he had never allowed me to declare his name in this letter then today I must have spoken to him.
In the letter, he wrote that when you appealed to release gas subsidy, I had left the subsidy and then I had forgotten.
My dear countrymen, you must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those people who have left the gas subsidy and to some of my delegates send a letter to them.
I am trying to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, the campaign to free the poor mothers from the slaughterhouse is excellent, I am an retired teacher.
The question is not of fifty thousand rupees but of the mother's emotions. And it is the blessings of such Kotikoti mothers and sisters that have the confidence and strength for the future of my country.
I salute that mother and I also salute those Kotikoti mothers of India who always wish to suffer their hardships.
My dear countrymen, last year we were in trouble due to drought, but this month of August was constantly filled with difficulties.
Some parts of the country have been flooded.
The State Governments have done as much as the Central Government, local bodies, social institutions and citizens.
However, among the flood news, there were some news that needed to be remembered more.
This year will be remembered for the 75th month of this year for what is the power of unity and how much results can be achieved together.
In August 2016, several parties, all the political parties, including those who did not give any chance against each other, and about 70 parties from all over the country, have passed the GST bill together.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, in the context of the situation of Kashmir, all the political parties of the country kept talking about Kashmir in one voice.
If he is supposed to be suppressed in the least words, then I would say that unity and compassion - these two things are in the basic mantra and we all believe that 1. 25 billion countrymen are in the opinion of the countrymen, from the head of the village to the head of the village, from the head of the village to the head of the Prime Minister that if anybody dies in Kashmir, then whether it is a young man or a security worker, this loss belongs to our people, our country, those people who are trying to create peace in Kashmir by taking these children forward, they will have to answer the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to further emphasize the importance of unity and bring out the country will create a bright future.
My brothers and sisters believe in the candidature of crores of countrymen.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani
My dear countrymen, greetings.
Today in the morning I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youngsters of Delhi and I was convinced that in the coming days, the color of sports will enhance the youth of the country with enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days, the world's largest sports event is going to be held.
The word Rio will be repeated in our ears.
The whole world will be sportspersons.
Every country in the world will keep an eye on the exhibition of its sportspersons, you will also keep it.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much but those who have gone to play in RIO, the work of increasing the enthusiasm of the players is of 1. 25 billion countrymen.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a milestone of 'Run for Rio', 'Khelo Aur Jio' and 'Khelo Aur Khilo'.
In the coming days, wherever we may be, how to encourage our players
No matter how much the drinking water is, we have to leave everything.
Even if there is a sweet smell in the winter, one has to leave the bed and run into the field and not only the player but also his parents.
Players are not made night and night.
I am ready to do this work on your behalf.
The country's leading postman is ready to deliver your message to these players.
Come, let us increase the glory and efforts of each and every player in the coming days.
And today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem has been sent by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University, a poem lover.
There may be many other poets who might have sent poetry, maybe write poetry, but some will also hear it.
Everyday technology keeps changing, everyday takes a new form, everyday creates new impact, it keeps changing.
You cannot capture technology.
If there is no research and innovation then the way sea water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a booze.
And if we live in the world without research and innovation, then we will have to emerge as a change age in the world and therefore we will have to give a boost to the spirit of attraction for science, research towards technology and innovation in the new generation.
The NITI Aayog is promoting Atal Innovation Mission.
It is aimed at creating an eco-system across the country through Atal Innovation Mission, innovation, experiment, enterprises, these categories are expected to grow new employment opportunities.
Similarly, there is a direct link between Incubation Centre (Incubation Centre) with innovation.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then the government has thought of giving a huge amount of Rs.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We see problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And through Atal Grand Challenge, the younger generation of the country have called upon you to find, research, innovate and solve the problems faced by you.
Government of India seeks to give a special prize to the technology discovered for solving our problems.
And I am happy that when we talk about the Tinkering Lab, about thirty thousand schools applied and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand institutions came forward for the Incubation Centre.
I am confident that research and innovation to Abdul Kalam ji will serve as our new generations on technology and simplification to get rid of our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worried about drought and today rain is also being enjoyed and flood news is also coming.
The State Government and the Union Government are making every effort to assist the flood victims in collaboration with them.
Everyone's mind, every human mind becomes confused even after having some difficulties due to rains because the center of our entire economic activity is in the rainy season.
Sometimes there is a disease that keeps us busy throughout our life.
But if we are aware, alert, efforts are being made then the ways to avoid this are also very easy.
Dengue was taken.
Dengue can be avoided.
Focus on cleanliness, be cautious and try to stay safe, pay special attention to the children and the poorest of the poor is imaginative but the case of dengue is not the same.
Dengue comes first in the happy and prosperous regions, so let us understand it.
You will be able to see the news on TV but sometimes we are aware of it and sometimes we are inclined to take the steps of contempt.
The government, hospitals and doctors will do their jobs, but we will not enter our houses, our regions, our families, and I will do the same thing to you.
On the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to my dear countrymen.
Life has become so raging, it has become so busy that we never have time to think for us.
If we have fallen sick then we feel that we will be able to recover quickly and we will be able to digest any antibiotic in our body.
But the bacteria that are bacteria are used by these medicines and then the medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria and then these diseases leave for years in fighting, making new medicines, scientific research etc.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing about such a change in their own way that there is no effect on medicines.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic resistance and hence it is essential to comply with the rules to use antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
However, in the last one decade, the maternal mortality rate has declined, but even today a large number of pregnant mothers cannot save their lives.
During pregnancy or later deficiency of blood , infection related to reproductive organs , HBP , do not know which problem can ever spoil his life .
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the past few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, on the ninth day of every month, a free examination will be conducted at Government Health Centres of all pregnant women.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not do this thing for the poor for twelve days in a year
I have written several letters in the past.
Thousands of dockers have taken forward my thoughts.
But India is such a big country that millions of dollars should join this campaign.
I am confident that you will definitely join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is very concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
There is a collective concern in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
During the Kurukshetra war, Lord Buddha also talks about trees.
In the Gita, Lord Shiva says, "World: All trees, that is, I drink in all the trees.
It is said in the French policy - Nasti Mool Anushadhan - There is no flora in which there is no medicinal qualities.
Mahabharatas Anushan Parv - it has been discussed in many areas and it is said that the trees planted are sanctuary for them.
There is no doubt about it.
The trees which they offer are tied to the trees like sandalwood in the palanquin.
A few days ago, an example of Pune's daughter Sonal was revealed to me that she touched my heart.
It is said in Mahabharata's philosophy that trees also fulfill the responsibilities of sanctity, and gold is not only of his parents but also of fulfilling the desires of the society.
The farmer of Narayanpur village, Khajuruti Mahatra, married his grandson Sonal in a very inspiring manner in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra.
When I saw their testimony in Social Media, it was surprising that even though there were no living creatures in marriage, the plants were visible all around.
The scene of that Tasvir was long-standing.
In a way, the marriage of Sonal has become an embodiment of love for nature. I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatraji for this new endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims visit the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrava.
And I would like to tell them that this is the message of Mata ji, if you go to your village and make it big then mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pilgrims came and lakhs of plants were distributed that year.
Temples can also start the tradition of giving leaves instead of Prasad in this festival.
A common man can become a movement of erosion.
Why shouldn't we make timber cultivation instead of waste
If we plant such trees on the banks of our farms that are furniture and household, it can be sold after fifteen-twenty years with the permission of the government.
And you can also become a new source of income and India can avoid importing Timber.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan-Mumbh - this is the biggest festival and we have resolved to plant five lakhs of trees.
There is no small issue of twenty five lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those people who know the land of Rajasthan know how big beads have been raised.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to increase its green cover by 50.
The Union Government has run the Green India Mission, under which the Railways have taken this step.
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of forest festivals.
This year, in Gujarat, several such projects have been taken up in the form of forest festivals and crores of trees have been planted.
I cannot mention all the states but they also deserve congratulations.
But for me the journey of South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever the words of violence, love and forgiveness fall in the world, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela are visible.
During my visit to South Africa, I had gone to the Financial Settlement, which is known as Mahatma Gandhian Housing Service.
I am also fortunate that the train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled in and the train that had transformed one of the greatest talents to become Mahatma Gandhi, the Peter Meritsburg Station.
But I got the opportunity to talk about this time to meet the dignitaries who have sacrificed their lives for equality and equal opportunity, who fought with Nelson Mandela.
Nelson Mandela lived in jail for twenty-twenty-twenty years.
In a way, he exhorted the entire youth and I was fortunate to visit the great personalities of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Tatha, Mr. Lalu Chiba, Mr. George Bezori, Roni Kasariels.
The symptoms of the symptoms that have been described in the lyrics are quite literate.
My heart will be remembered for this visit.
There cannot be a bigger mantra for any society and government.
The priorities will be different, but the path is the same and that is the path of development, equality, equal opportunity, equity and morality.
Let us take pride in our Indians who have lived in South Africa and have shown the basic mantras of our lives.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Verma.
Those who have sent me a message and their concern is very natural.
Because of being a woman, I feel sad about it again.
And some people get frustrated and lose their money.
There is a new way of drifting through this technology worldwide.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a short while they came to know that everything has been stuck.
But recently I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
The artistic pictures have been posted at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you must visit the station.
Today, I am receiving such news from several railway stations in India and local people are presenting their area on the walls of railway stations through their art.
There is a new feeling.
This is an example of how a transformation can be done by the participation of the people.
Congratulations to all those who have done this kind of work in the country, special congratulations to my friends of Aligarh.
And you will also be attending the festival outside your house.
We have special significance in the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Like last year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, can you not give the mothers and sisters of your country the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
Just imagine, give such gifts to the sister who will really protect her in life.
And today there is social security.
Today, the true meaning of defence is.
My dear countrymen, many of us have been born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in independent India.
The entire nation should be colored in the colors of freedom fighters, we should once again create this environment by feeling the fragrance of freedom all around and the freedom movement should not be a programme of the countrymen.
Like Deepawali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you too will do something related to the inspiration of patriotism.
The people who want you to keep your point in the ramparts of the Red Fort.
And nowadays, technology platforms are so easy that you can easily send things to me.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everyone makes several programmes in the holidays.
And that is why there is a weather in the holidays, that is why it feels like enjoying a person.
And there is a feeling that if you get a chance to sleep sometime in the afternoon then it will be better.
But the terrible heat of this time has enjoyed all around.
But I have seen that the citizens also make very good efforts.
How many villages are aware of awareness and what is the value of water, they know what is the problem of water.
And that is why there is a sensitivity about water at such a place and there is also the activity of conserving it.
A few days ago, somebody told me that the Bajar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra have taken water in the form of a very sensitive question in the village.
The crops that used the most water, then it decided to leave the crops of sugarcane or bananas.
It looks very simple to hear, but it is not so simple.
And everybody went on the farms of horticulture and vegetables that require less water.
They have taken initiatives like Fuwara, Drip Irrigation-Tapaksinchai, rainwater harvesting, water conservation etc.
I would like to talk about Bajar village on a small hill but there will be so many such villages.
I congratulate all such villagers for their excellent work.
Someone told me that there is a Gorava Gram Panchayat in Des district in Madhya Pradesh.
The Commission has made efforts to create select surveillance.
However, water is saved, but when water comes to the surface, there is also a big improvement in water quality.
Someone feels that as soon as the Government of India has provided water to Latur by train, it has become a news for the world.
It is true that the speed at which the Railways has done this thing is worthy of congratulations, but the people of Pela village are equally congratulating.
I would like to say that more than Railways are worthy of congratulations.
However, many such schemes which are being run by the citizens have not yet come up.
The nature of the person, however, may be passing through many problems, but when a good news comes, it feels like it has been completely disturbed.
This year, the possibility of rainfall from 106 to 110 per cent has been announced as if a message of great peace has come to light.
There is a time for rains but the news of good rains also brought a new consciousness.
It gives us an opportunity to enjoy the news that will be a good monsoon.
Can we run a campaign to save village water from now on
The farmers need soil and the crops are used in the fields.
Why don't we take the soil out of the ponds of the village this time
This will also improve the land of the fields and also increase the water conservation capacity of the ponds.
Whether the water can be stopped by filling in the barrels of seric cement, in empty slopes of fertilizers, iron and soil
If water stops for five days, if water stops for seven days, then water will go down to the ground.
There will be water in our wells.
Water should be stopped as much as possible.
We have the time for the next one and a half months, however, whether it is a water crisis or a drought situation.
And I have always said that when we go to the birthplace of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, there is a place where we want to see that how many buses have been constructed under the house to save rain water and how clean water remains in it.
This work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
It is very natural for the millions of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna to have this question.
Ganga Mokshadayini is for those who have religious beliefs.
I will accept this greatness, but moreover, I feel that the Ganga is a lifeline.
We get employment from the Ganga and we get a new strength to live with the Ganga.
As the Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
We have brought the Ganga to a place but crores of Bhagiraths are required to save it.
This work cannot be successful without populist participation.
And that is why we all have to become representatives of change for cleanliness and cleanliness, we have to repeat this thing again and again.
Several efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are also being made to take full support from the states that are located on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to prevent pollution in Patna and industrial pollution.
Everyday, a large number of solid waste waste is being used in the Ganges.
To clean such wastes, it works to clean waste immediately in the trash skimmer water at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
These machines have been provided to the institutions of all local Swaraj and are requested to continue and clean waste from there.
And in the last few days, I have been told that there is a lot of effort there and the waste is being extracted from 3 to 11 tonnes per day.
The evacuation of waste or block links from the pulp and pepper industry is almost complete.
All these are indications that we are moving forward in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person is found not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung south then he certainly says that if the Ganga will be clean
This is the peoples faith that will surely succeed in the Ganga Safai.
People are also giving donations for cleanliness of the Ganga.
This system is being run in a very good way.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today, the Panchayati Raj system in the entire country is successfully working as an important unit of our democratic system.
Therefore, in collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India has launched the Bharat Yojana from 14th April to 24th April, 10th April.
And today, on 24th, I will go to Jharkhand and celebrate the Panchayati Raj Diwas in the region where our most tribal brothers and sisters live.
And once again on the occasion of Panchayati Raj Day, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a great job of awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at the level of villages in every corner of India
How to make the village self-reliant
How does the village make its own development plan
The birth anniversary of the daughter should be a festival of the village.
There are several such schemes.
In some villages, food programmes were organized.
Perhaps in all the villages of India, such programmes have been organized for 10 days at a very short time.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the Sarpanches of the villages for this thing.
In a very clever way, with innovation, he reflected this entire opportunity in a way for the development of the village, for the strengthening of the democracy.
The awareness that has been created in the villages is the guarantee of India's emergence.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I speak from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
I have a question about education in school colleges.
There has been a need for reforms in the education sector for many years.
For example, there should not be enough schools or colleges or there should not be quality in education.
Today, if there is any first dream of parents in every family then it is for good education of children.
Homes, cars, all think.
And this feeling of public mind for a country like India is very powerful.
The concern that children get good education should be increased and more awareness should be there.
And the children are also aware that I go to school for this work.
And that is why I would urge all the girls and parents to give a detailed time to talk about the activities being done in the school.
And if anything is noticed then go to school and talk to the teachers.
This opportunity can also reduce many of our educational systems.
In a way, the effort to spread education around was the priority.
And that was also necessary.
But more important than the importance of expanding now is the improvement in our education.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Now with the Saksharta Abhiyan, good education will have to make it our priority.
Entry, Entrance, Entrance Mantra continues to be lost, but now we have to focus on good education, proper education and education for those children who have reached the school.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize good education.
But it is true that we need to bring about reforms.
You must have seen this time in the budget that the work has been done by chewing cheese.
In the budget, he has asked ten government universities and ten private universities to get rid of government restrictions and come on a challenging path. Let us tell you what you want to do to become the top university.
This scheme has been launched with the intention of giving them complete freedom.
Indias universities can also become global competing units.
At the same time, the importance of education is equally important.
Similarly, technology will also play a major role in education.
Remote space education and technology will also make our education easier.
I am confident that the results will be seen in a very close future.
For a long time people keep asking me on one subject.
Some people write on Webportal May.
Some people write to me on Narendra Modi App and most of these young people write to me.
In today's era, along with studying for the youth, sports is also very important.
So one day I had to talk to you people and I would like to talk to you all seven times before that.
The result was that I have just spoken of a meeting which was headed by NCC, head of NSS, head of Scout and Guides, Red Cross, Nehru Yuva Kendra.
And when I asked him who had met earlier, he said, "No, our brother, this kind of first meeting has been organised after the independence of the country.
I have got the same benefit in my childhood. And I believe that a new life of these organisations should be fulfilled and new strength should be harnessed.
This time I have kept some topics in front of them.
I have told them, Brothers and sisters, why don't our youth, all the organizations do a great job of water conservation in this season
How many such programs can be created to connect the country
What can be the common youth of all our organizations
What new things can be added to their work culture and programmes
If you write on my Narendra Modi app, I will send it to the right place.
Such a situation will become.
My dear countrymen, today I want to inspire you all to think about it.
I also look at this thing as a shock to the people.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that in the last several elections there used to be discussions about how much the party would provide gas cylinders.
And every political party felt that if it was going to the middle class community in terms of elections, then there was a huge issue of gas battalion.
On the other hand, economists used to pressurize them to reduce the subsidy.
And because of this, several committees were set up, in which huge proposals were made to reduce the gas subsidy.
These committees used to spend crores of rupees behind.
But the thing was going on there.
This experience belongs to all.
But there was no thought outside it.
My countrymen, I am happy to inform you today that I have adopted the third path.
One crore families voluntarily submitted their gas subsidy.
However, it was known that in one crore families, there were more than 80 percent of the people who had lost their shareholders, were living in queues and were writing.
This incident has forced the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if this happens to the world's economists then they will do it.
For them, there is an extension of their thoughts and how will one have to think about it
I specially want to call upon the entire political class today that we need to rely on the people everywhere.
You must not have thought that we will get such a result.
And we should go in this direction.
Keep an eye on those who are sending marks by giving their tests.
Sometimes I feel that we should announce that there will be no vaccine checker in the roots of the railways today.
Each newspaper and the News channel has a bad news.
Is it not good that in the country of crores of people around us
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that only positive reports were published on the first page of the paper.
He continued to say this thing.
A few days ago, a newspaper also wrote to me, he said, We have decided not to give a single negative message on Monday.
This is one of the biggest reasons for inspiring good news.
However, it is a matter of fact that the amount of electricity that we will give to the good will be reduced.
If we propose Diu, we will be able to overcome a lot.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji has given a good suggestion but please do not be angry with me.
Let us all try to genuinely and try to speak positively.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh.
Kumbh can also be a center of attraction for tourism.
Very few people around the world will be aware that for such a long time crores of people will come to the bank of the river.
For the past two days, I have been seeing that many people are uploading the testimony of the Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government to compete with it.
Photo competition and tell people to upload beautiful photographs.
How the atmosphere will be created at a rapid pace and people will also be aware of the diversity of the Kumbh Mela.
So it can be done.
The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, he said that we have given special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that cleanliness remains there.
People also take the message of cleanliness from there.
I believe that this Kumbh may be a religious and spiritual festival, but we can also make it a social opportunity.
We should do this Kumbh as well as how we can enhance the love of water from this Kumbh, how we can enhance the faith of water and how we can use this Kumbh in giving the message of water conservation.
My dear countrymen, I would like to meet you once again in the evening on this important day of Panchayati Raj.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You might be reminded that while passing, I had discussed a book of the legends of Prem Chand ji and we had decided to share something with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared information about several types of books.
I am glad that people are discussing books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyles on many topics.
I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But I have to admit that now I cannot give too much time to read books.
But there is a need to know about the books that you people have written and sent.
But from the experience of last month, I feel that we have to take it forward.
Why should we create a permanent Books Corner on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read new books, write about it and discuss it.
And you can also suggest a good name for our Books Courner.
I want this box to become an active platform for corners readers and writers.
You keep reading, keep writing and share it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country on water conservation.
People have to tell about traditional methods and solutions.
Midia too has a lot of new heights on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, everything is being done at the level of war.
It is a matter of great satisfaction and satisfaction for seeing the potential of the community.
Like Jharkhand, the enthusiasm shown by the villagers in the Arakam village of Ormenesi, far away from Ranchi, has become an example for everyone.
You will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of Ishaan India, Meghalaya, has become the first state in the country to prepare its own water policy and water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, crop farming has been encouraged which requires less water and farmers do not have any harm.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for interacting with the farmers and inspired them to harvest from traditional farming for less water crops.
Now the time has come for festivals.
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals.
Why dont we use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm and specially the achievements of children, their achievements give us new energy. And that is why today I feel like talking about some children - Nidhi Bipotu, Monish Joshi, Deonshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdarkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Arunatesh Ganguly and Hrithik Alla.
Whatever I say about them will also fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that threatens the whole world.
It seems that death is standing at the gate, but all these ten children have not only defeated fatal diseases like cancer in their lives, but have brought India to the world through their curriculum.
However, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a unique sports event in which the Young Cancer Surveyor i. e.
Competitions like shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and swimming tennis were organised in the competition.
All these ten champions of our country won the medals in this tournament.
Some of these sportspersons won more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I am very confident that you must have been proud of the success of India across the sky, in space, I am talking about Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjay Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga, Kolkata, P.
Aravindrao, several such people from different parts of the country have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and he has urged me to discuss Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
Indeed, space vision 2019 has been very good for India.
Our scientists left A-SAT in March and thereafter Chandrayaan 2.
There was no further discussion of big and important news like A-SAT during the election race.
In just three minutes from A-SAT missile, we achieved the capability to break the satellite, three hundred kilometers away.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement and now on 22nd July, the entire country saw with pride that Chandrayaan-2 pushed from Sriharikota towards space.
But if you ask me what two major teachings I have received from Chandrayaan-2 then I will say that these two teachings are Feath and Fearlessness i. e.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, we must believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be glad to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely immersed in Indian color.
It is an Indian in a way of purpose and spirit.
It is completely an indigenous mission.
It is unprecedented that the way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan-Been in a revolutionary time, by bringing all the technological problems together day and night.
The entire world saw this great penance of scientists.
We also have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that we have the ability to handle them.
I hope that the Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
Well, science is the path of development.
Now we are eagerly waiting for the month of September when the Lander Vikram and Rover Science will be discovered on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the students and young friends of the country and invite the youth of the country for a quiz competition.
Scientists related to space, Indias Space Mission, Science and Technology will be the main subjects of this uiz Competition as to what to do for the release of rockets.
How the satellites are set up in the room and what kind of information we get from the satellite, what is A-SAT, there are many things.
I appeal to young friends and students to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, comfortable and memorable by your participation.
I specially urge schools, girls, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their schools victorious.
Encouraging all students to join it and the most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the highest qualification students from every state to Sriharikota at their own expense and in September they will get the opportunity to become the moment when Chandrayaan will be landing on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event in his life for these victorious students.
But for this you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to get the maximum marks and you will continue to win.
Friends, My suggestion must have given you a happy opportunity.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
Our thoughts have given momentum to the Swachhta Abhiyan on time and similar efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting new benchmarks for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in cleanliness, but the way Swachhta Abhiyan has been successful from ODF to public places, it is the power of the resolve of 1.
This movement is now moving towards beauty with cleanliness.
Just a few days ago, I was talking about Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is an engineer of the Army and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
He has stepped upon making Delhi clean, not just a few days back, but also a beautiful one.
He started the Lodhi Garden with his team.
Through the Street Art, several areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the overbridge and schools to the slums, when they started scrutinizing their duties, people also got together and this process started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was also decorated with street paintings during Kumbh.
I came to know that Bhai Yogesh Saini and his team played a very important role in this.
Whether there is no sound in the colors and the lines, but the message of the intellectuals created by it proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this thing in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us that the culture of making waste to wealth is developed in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward towards making waste waste waste waste.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, I have read a lot of interest tips on MyGov.
This comment was from Bhai Mohammad Aslam, who lived in the shops of Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: How to listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme
I am happy to say that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organised in June.
I feel that such programmes should be organised every three months.
Besides, the programme should also be online monitoring.
In my view, this was the first such event in which the public had a direct interaction with the government.
Brothers and sisters, after reading the message that Mohammad Aslam ji sent to me, my eagerness to know about the Back to Village programme has increased and when I came to know about it from the region, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
This programme shows how enthusiastic the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
This programme lasted for weeks and in almost four and a half thousand panchayats of the state government officials briefed the people of the village about the scope of government schemes and programmes.
How can the Panchayats be further strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can be the impact of their services in the lives of the common man The people of the village have also spoken about their problems.
Friends, this programme was not merely forbidden that the officers would return to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
It also included several other things to make the programme interesting.
Under Khelo India, sports competition was held for children.
Further, Sports Kit, Manerega Job Card and SC-ST certificates were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir became a participant in this festival of development.
It is a matter of joy that the Back to Village programme was also organised in remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for a day and a half while passing through difficult roads.
These officers also reached the marginal commissions which are always in the shadow of the tablets after crossing the border, and not only did the officers reach the highly sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgram and Anantnag districts without any fear.
Some of the officers were so convinced that they were staying in the village for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in this show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir have good governance and this also proves that the power of development is always heavy on the strength of Bomb Bondook.
It is clear that those who want to spread liberty in the path of development, want to create obstacles, can never succeed in their fabricated intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented a month of the month of the month of Shravan in his poem.
In this poem, he said: "In fact, the bonds of rainwater and water currents are unique and the earth is desperate to see its beauty.
In the whole of India, people from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Shravan in their own way.
Whenever we want to be around us in this season, it seems as if the earth has covered the green sheet.
During this period, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that the highest number of devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave since 1st July.
More than the total number of pilgrims who participated in this journey lasting for 60 days in 2015, this time only 28 days have been included.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I especially urge the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who return from the journey become admirers of the spirit of harmony and spirit of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that even in Uttarakhand this year, four Dham Yatra has started and more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half.
For the first time, a number of pilgrims have reached there after the distress in 2013.
I appeal to you that you must go to those parts of the country whose beauty blossoms during monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and travel may not be a big teacher than that.
My best wishes to you all for this beautiful and lively month of Shravan, to communicate with you new energy, new hopes and new expectations.
Similarly, it is reminded of the 'Bharat Bachao' of 20 months.
However, when we are on TV, only one aspect of rain shows us - floods, water filled, traffic jams.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am also concerned about the concerns of your children.
But if we change our ways of looking at the exams then perhaps we can become anxious too.
In my last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I am happy that you have sent me your experience and your suggestions on Narendra Modi App.
Teachers, those students whose career has been very successful, parents, some thinkers of the society have sent me a lot of things.
I will also do some of the things that I have read.
I will be able to get rid of what I feel.
I would like to share with you the message that Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tendulkar has sent to the youth of India.
You must work hard, but set a real target for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was a cricketer, there was a lot of expectations from me.
So it was very important for me to find a light.
So I thought that I will keep the league and fulfill my goals.
But I am fulfilling the goal of my happiness and fulfilling it. I am doing something good for the country.
And I always tried to achieve that goal.
My focus was on speeches and goals gradually achieved.
I will tell you that it is very important that your thoughts are positive.
Why competition
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why shouldn't we compete together
Why dont we decide to break all our old records
You joys, no one can stop you from moving forward.
And when you break your old records then you will not have any expectation for happiness or satisfaction.
Do not consider exams as games of statistics.
Don't be stuck in the accounts of how you reached.
Life should be linked with some great objective.
The dreams should be taken and resolved.
Whether we are going right or not, our pace is correct or not.
And that is why if the dream is huge, it will become a joyous festival on its own.
Every examination will be a step towards fulfilling this great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving this great objective.
And don't be limited to what will happen this year and what will happen in this examination.
If there is a greater purpose then it will not be desirable if there is less than expected.
More and more efforts will be made.
Thousands of people have written to me about mobile phones on my app.
Gupta has stressed that healthy mind remains in a healthy body.
Students, along with your studies, also take care of your health so that you can write properly in the examination.
Now, I dont want to start a pledge on the last day and go for three kilometers and five kilometers to run.
But one thing is true, especially in the days of exams, how is your heart
Our 365 days must be unparalleled in our dreams and resolves.
I agree with Shriman Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has specially urged us to sleep in time and revision by rising early in the morning.
The testing centre should be accessed before taking the entrance sheet and other items.
My dear brothers and sisters, I don't want to say this because I am slightly sad about the well-being.
And many of my friends keep complaining to me that you are sleeping very little.
And this is possible.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even in a single part of our body.
Not only this, our hearts too get disturbed.
And that is why we don't consider any cheese as small.
You joys, you don't have to bear yourself in the habit of compromising with what is certain.
Make sure you do.
Dosto, however, I have seen that there are two types of students in those students who go for examination.
You must have seen these two kinds of students.
If anybody can do this thing better than me, then the master who has a mastery in making a checkmap and the world's largest players who have made a checkmap.
He will share his experience with the Champion Vishwanathan of the same chase.
Come, learn from them the way you make a checkmap in this examination.
Hello, let me begin my speech by conveying my best wishes to you all for the first time.
I will talk a little about the tests and experiences I have given.
The tests have been followed by problems in life.
When you play, you don't know what kind of learning will happen now. You don't even know what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, healthy and have taken enough steps then you will get the right answer that will give you the mind at that moment.
So be calm.
Don't put too much pressure on yourself, don't keep too much expectations, it is very important.
I am reminded of the fact that during the year, I can raise problems.
In the last minute, the topics you don't seem to be reminded of are among the important things.
Some of the details you can recall with the teachers or students who will be helpful in writing the exams.
If you repeat the questions you are facing difficulties then it will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write about it very well in your examination.
Therefore, be calm, be sufficient, don't be in utmost faith, don't be disappointed, initially there is fear, but I can successfully cross these tests.
Therefore, have full faith in it.
Vishwanathan joy has really made a very important point.
How we used to listen, how many birds were watching Arjun's life.
You cannot calm down your mind if you are going to gather the books in the last minute.
Laugh, let's laugh very much, let's say jox with friends, you see, only then will the desire for peace be created.
You can imagine that you are awake at a pond and there is a very beautiful thing under the pond.
But suddenly, if a stone is thrown in some water and a swelling starts in the water then what would be the beautiful things that were seen in the pond
If the water is calm then the things may not be as deep as it is.
But if water is unsatisfactory then it is not visible below .
And then I feel that if we dont get light then I will feel better.
So I have myself developed my technology.
You can have this feeling which will also help you.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
He writes on my App: We feel light with friends and family for at least half an hour every day, Rajat ji has said this very important thing because most of us have come here by examining ourselves, we are sitting here to know how wrong we have done.
We are trapped in this.
Don't do that.
Just come out and spend half an hour.
It is really like understanding about Rajat ji.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting it in the present context, is trying to bring this culture of the country and the world to the Sarita.
Such venerable possibilities have also sent important tips for students.
And he is also a teacher, a thinker and hence there is a convenience of diversity in his thoughts.
I feel that we can be very happy and happy by accepting the situation.
In your examination, if you go beyond stress and happiness, you will definitely succeed and even if you do not get success, you will not be able to get lost and it will also be a pride to be successful.
I am also grateful to Pujayshree Muraribapu for giving us a very good message.
Dosto, I want to tell you another thing today.
I am seeing that this time people who have told me their experiences have definitely discussed Yoga.
Friends, I must clarify today that if you start doing yoga from tomorrow morning then it will be unfair to you.
However, it is true that Yoga is a big trick in the development journey of space.
Easy chewing.
Look, if you can do it.
I have great faith in it.
It's not like that.
But if we read the suggestions then perhaps we have to copy to us that yes, it is correct, lets go.
And I would like to urge you to go for five minutes but read the instructions.
When I read for the first time, I felt that it wasn't me, but if I read the same thing again, I noticed that no question was asked in another way, but this is my concern.
Rao, he has stressed on the threshold.
In very few words, a very good message has been given to all the students.
Come, listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
It is from Bangalore to C.
N.
R.
Let me tell you.
I believe that it is natural to have anxiety due to examination.
And these are the competitive tests.
Don't worry, you do good.
I am the same to my young friends.
Remember that there is a lot of opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees, you also have the right to be here.
Strength, steadfastness and penance should be in you.
With such a quality, you will be successful in every exam and other efforts.
Good Blase, what is the way to talk about a scientific
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
What he has said - Nastyani, Tamani, this is the same thing - Dedication, Determination, Diligence.
If you continue, fear will also be there.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do a good job.
Now, on my App, I have given a message about the experience of exams from the left.
He said that there is a relentless effort in his family to create a positive environment during the examination.
It is true that the Secretary also mentioned the positive approach, the positive frame of mind.
We are studying in our curriculum on Electricity Goods Research Thomas LWE.
Friends, how many years have they taken to do this thing, how many years have they been successful, how much time has passed, how much money has been spent, how much was the result of failure.
But today this electricity bulb also enrichs our lives.
It is said that the prospects of success are also hidden in failure.
Who does not know Srinivas Ramanujan One of the recognitions of the modern times - Indian guidance, you must know.
He did not have any special training that was not included in his formal education.
But he contributed immensely to various sectors such as metamorphical analysis, number theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved by anyone.
The Harry Potter category is popular all over the world today, but it was not the beginning.
He had to face a lot of difficulties.
Rolling said that in times of trouble, he used to do all the energy that was really important for him.
The examination is not only of the students, but of the entire thinking and of the entire school and of the teacher.
However, it is not good to have a single student without the help of the girl and the teacher.
The examination becomes easier if a teacher or a lawyer or a senior student becomes a unit by forming a team and proceeding in a planned manner.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the app: He has complained that no pressure should be made to bring more marks on their children.
They should be encouraged only to prepare.
If the child is talking to his friend then do not stop him.
Make a light environment, create a positive environment, be it your daughter or daughter, see how many confidants come.
You will also be able to see that confidence.
Dosto, one thing is certain, especially I want to tell the young friends that the life of our people has changed much more than our older generations.
Every time new discovery, new technologies and sciences are seen as critical colors.
And we are not just promising.
We also want to move ahead with the freedom of science.
I am doing this because today is the National Science Day.
The Science Festival of the country celebrates 28th February as National Science Day.
28th February, 128th C.
Raman was announcing his discovery Raman Effect.
He was awarded Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
Gynaecology is the people of science.
Without science and technology, new discovery cannot be achieved.
On the occasion of National Science Day, the emphasis is on new discoveries in the country.
Genetics, technology, all these things should become an integral part of our development journey.
This time, the theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Driveen Innovations.
Dosts, how many successes are achieved after a long time and when success is achieved then the vision of seeing the world changes.
If you are experiencing a lot of exams then you might be able to see that many reports are not mentioned in your mind.
But I want to tell the countrymen this thing again.
You must have heard in the last few days that there has been a huge and significant exploration in the world of science.
The scientists of the world worked hard, the generations used to divert, and after nearly a hundred years a success took place.
The discovery of the Gravitational Waves has emerged as the manpower of our scientists.
This discovery is a far-reaching achievement of science.
This discovery does not testify to the theory of our great scientific instrument of the last century, but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire mankind will work for the entire world.
But being an Indian, we are glad that the honourable scientists of our country were involved in the process of exploration.
Our scientists will continue to work towards furthering research in the future.
India will also be a partner in international efforts.
And my countrymen, in the last few days, we have made an important decision.
In order to achieve more success in this discovery, the government has decided to open the Laser Interformer Gravitational-Wave Observation Logo in India.
By connecting India, this process will get a new energy and new momentum.
India will be an active partner in this enormous scientific research process of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again I extend my greetings to all the scientists.
You can hear my Mann Ki Baat by mixing messed up on that number from tomorrow.
You can also hear in your mother tongue.
The number is 8108-8108.
81908- 81908 posts, your examination is starting.
You know, brother tomorrow is a budget.
We all celebrated Christmas festival on the eve of the day and now preparations for the new year are going on.
India is full of diversity.
In a way, every festival keeps on waiting for another festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where there is a festive economy.
This becomes the reason for the economic activities of the poorest of the society.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Christmas (Natal) and many greetings of the New Year of 2016.
The year 2016 brings to you all the joys related to it.
New zeal, new zeal, new resolve will give you new heights.
Shri Ganesh V.
The climate is climate for the tourists.
A large number of tourists from the country and abroad come here.
People also celebrate the holidays of Natal.
The more clean our tourist destinations, the more India's image will be in the world.
I welcome the ideas of Ganeshji and I am bringing Ganeshji to the countrymen.
However, we call the guest gods and goddesses.
And, in our tourist destinations, in our tourist destinations, in our pilgrimage halls, this is really a special pilgrimage.
However, he is an ordinary worker and works hard, labours.
He has done such a unique job, that the news is published.
And when this thing came to my notice then I felt that I had brought this thing to you.
In Bhojpura, he has constructed 100 toilets so far, considering that this work is a sacred task without his hard work and hard work.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Dilip Singh Malaviya.
Sometimes we hear about depression.
And that is why it is natural for them to take pride for Dilip Singh in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the result of the untiring efforts of several people that the country is progressing at a rapid pace.
125 crore countrymen are also moving ahead with one step by taking a step by step.
New opportunities for greater education, excellent skills and employment.
It is a great task to provide easy loans under Mudra Yojana to the people of the common man who could not reach the bank twelve.
Who can forget the occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna When Balkrishna opened his mouth and showed the entire universe to Mother Yashoda.
It has made India a habitat in the event of Yoga.
In a way, cleanliness is being embraced at home.
Participation of citizens is also increasing.
After so many years of independence, the village which has access to electric pillars, how much enthusiasm and excitement is due to the blindness of the village, perhaps we cannot imagine the power that the people living in the cities use.
Until now, there has been no widespread discussion in the media but I am confident that the media will certainly reach such villages. And the biggest benefit will be that the employees of the government who are doing this work will be so satisfying that they have done something that will bring about a change in the villages and villages.
Whether it is a farmer, a poor person, a young man or a woman, should all these services be provided or not
Therefore, it should not be ascertained what the government has done and how the government has not worked.
However, it should be decided that if they are interested in this matter then do not let them go.
Should they also get information for their rights
We should all strive to bring the right thing, the right thing, the right thing, the right thing, the right thing to do with the mankind, the more people can reach.
This is also the work of a service.
I have also made a small effort to do this thing in my own way.
I can't do everything if I'm alone.
But should I do something different from what I am doing
A common citizen can also join me by downloading an App on his mobile phone.
And I keep sharing these small things on it.
And it is a matter of joy for me that people also tell me a lot.
How will I reach without your help
Come, let us all share the interests of the common man, in the language of the common man and inspire them to get the goods of their deeds
This was followed by discussions in all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on the 16th of January, the Government of India is going to launch the entire Action Plan of Startup India, Stand Up India.
And in this programme, IIT, IIMs, Central Universities, NITOs and all youths from all over the country will be included in this programme through Live-Connectivity.
This startup is for them, be it digital world or be it IT business.
No, we have to bring about changes as per the requirements of India.
The market will be available.
Similarly, the intelligence of our youth is there enough limited limit for some cities
This idea is wrong.
The youngsters have talent in the vicinity of Hindustan, the champions should get an opportunity.
These start-up India, Stand-up India, some cities should not be sufficiently limited.
And I also urge the state governments to take this forward.
On January 16, I will surely meet you and discuss this in detail and always welcome your suggestions.
It is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda ji on 12 January.
They are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanandji.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 15th to 12th January.
This year, it is scheduled to be held in Rampur, Chhattisgarh from 12 January to 16 January.
And I have come to know that this time is their theme because this event is based on the theme, that the theme is very good, I have been told about the Indian Youth: of Development Skill and Harmony that more than 10 thousand youths from all states, from all sections of the country are going to be gathered.
Youth is to create a vision of India.
In a way, dreams have to be fulfilled.
The resolution is about to be realized.
Can you inform me about this youth festival
I especially urge the youngsters that I am the Narendra Modi App.
So I will wait for you to know your thoughts about the Youth Festival on Narendra Modi App.
Ahmedabad, Dilip Chauhan, Gujarat, who is a visually challenged teacher, celebrated Accessible India Day in his school.
He has conveyed his heartfelt condolences to me, Sir, and celebrated the Accessible India Campaign in my school.
We enjoyed school enjoyment and encouraged children to help disorders in the society.
I feel that it was the first time you have done.
Dileep ji thank you very much.
And you are working in this area yourself.
If you understand these things in a very good way, you will have to face a lot of difficulties.
Sometimes there is an opportunity to meet such people in the society and some of us think.
We also express our vision of visiting them as per our thinking.
And for such people, many words have been used in the jag, but there has always been a contemplation of words.
Every time people feel that the identity of this word is not good for them, it is not honourable.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I had to go to that programme.
However, in some districts of Tamil Nadu and particularly in Tamil Nadu, that is why I could not attend the launch programme on that day.
But I had to go to that programme and I had some thoughts in my mind.
So at that time, I had thought that God has given any deficiency in the body, has given some injury, is doing the right thing, he also calls them virus and he knows it as virus.
But whenever he comes to know that we see a deficiency from his eyes, but I have given him some special privilege.
After that, I got the idea that from the eyes we feel that it is irregular, but I feel that there is an extra power available with it.
And then I felt that why shouldn't we use the word Divyang in place of disorder in our country
These are the people who have such a part that each and everybody is a part of the system that has divinity and divinity, which is not with us, the common man.
I like this word very well.
My countrymen, can we popularise the habit of divine words at the place of disabilities
I am sure you will take this forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, it will make it easier for the people of Divyang by improving the interface in both physical and indirect ways.
Be it schools, bus stations, railway stations or ramps, easy parking, easy lifts, braille lipids, how many things are there
In order to simplify their availability, we need innovation, technology, system and sensitivity.
We have taken up the bed of this work.
Democracy is also being achieved.
He should not die in the files.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made an effort to reach out to the beneficiaries of the schemes.
In our country, gas cylinders are subsidized.
The government has made some changes in it.
Ensuring access to bank accounts of the beneficiaries through the Benefit Transfer Scheme, the world's largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme, whether it is Jan Dhan account or Aadhaar card.
This scheme has been known by the name of the first and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people using cooking gas have become beneficiaries of Pahal Yojana.
14 crore people accounts have started to go straight into the bank accounts.
There is no need for any intermediaries or any recommendations or the possibility of any corruption.
On the one hand, the Aadhar card campaign, on the other hand, will open the Jan Dhan account on the other, on the third hand, the State Government and the Government of India together will prepare a list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have started going directly to the beneficiary's account through various schemes.
I am sure that about 35 to 40 schemes are being directly incorporated within the benefit transfer.
My dear countrymen, on 26 January, a golden moment of the Republic Day of India is also a pleasant coincidence that this time the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the architect of our Constitution.
The Parliament also had a special discussion on the Constitution for two days and had a very good experience.
All the parties, all the MPs have discussed the sacredness of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the understanding of the Constitution in the true form etc.
We should move forward in this regard.
The Republic Day can connect people with the system in true sense .
Our Constitution gives us a lot of rights and officers are discussed smoothly and should also be done.
However, the Constitution also emphasizes on duty.
But it has been observed that the talk of duty is very low.
When elections are held in large numbers then there are four publications, walls are written, hoardings are placed that it is our sacred duty to vote.
There is a lot of fate at the time of voting, but why don't there be any fate in social life
When we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar this year, can we organize competitions in schools, colleges in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, in organizations, on issues of taxation, competition, poetry competition, commitment etc
What a great history can be drawn if we move ahead with the mission of crores of Indians.
Can you send me that
I want to know your thoughts.
He sent me to my portal, May Gov.
I would certainly like to know what the youth of my country thinks about taxation.
There is a feeling of a small suggestion.
On 26th January, when we observe the Republic Day, we are the idols of the great men in our city by the citizens, by the children of school colleges.
And I am not saying this by the government.
Can the sons of the society, the sons of the country make it our natural habit
On 26th January, we should collectively strive to honour the idols of such great men, to clean the campus and all these will be easily done by the people, by the citizens.
My dear countrymen, once again many greetings of the New Year 2016.
You must have got the opportunity to go to Konk.
And along with the new Umang-Utseh, business and employment have also started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also begun.
Festivals have an important place in the lives of society.
Every corner of the world is constantly receiving the news of natural calamities and there is a news of natural calamities that have not been heard or thought.
People are also experiencing the impact of climate change.
Many people have died.
I express my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
The state governments are working hard to save relief.
The central government also works consistently.
Recently, a piece of Tamil Nadu has gone by the Government of India.
But whenever there is a problem all around, we have to bring about a lot of change in it.
15 years ago, the natural disaster was a part of the agriculture sector, as it was limited to the maximum natural calamity, i. e.
Today, its form has changed.
At every level, we have become very impossible to work for our capacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens, every small institution will have to work very scientifically for capacity building.
After the Nepalese conflict, I spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawab Sharif.
And I had suggested to them that the SAARC countries should collectively make a joint statement for the cause of disaster.
I am glad that a team of SAARC countries, Excise Ease and Best Practices, were concluded in Delhi.
There was a good beginning.
Today, I have received the call of Lakhvinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I speak from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We are doing organic farming here and guiding many people.
Lakhvinder Singh ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
Not only this, you are well aware of the problem of farmers.
And your concern is true but this is not just in Punjab Haryana.
This is our habit throughout India and traditionally we are moving on the path of burning the ruins of our crops like this.
But the pain you have suffered is true.
The first solution is that we have to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not true.
The remains of crops are also very precious.
They themselves are a biological fertilizer.
We have put it on the wedge.
If a small piece of it is made then it becomes a dry fruit for the animals.
Secondly, the upper layer of the land gets burnt due to its childhood.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a moment think that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidneys should be good, but if the upper skin of the body is burnt then what will happen
Even if the heart is on, we cannot live.
Our layer falls on the ground, which pushes our produce to death.
And therefore, we should make a positive effort.
It becomes a sure thing even if it is once again plundered into the ground.
Or if some water is poured into a pit by putting a pitcher in a pit then a good kind of biological fertilizer is created.
Animal food is not only used for food but also our land is saved but it also benefits twice if it is put on the fertilizer prepared in the ground.
I once got the opportunity to interact with the farmers who had cultivated bananas.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier when he used to cultivate banana and when the crop of banana was finished, he had to spend five thousand, ten thousand, fifteen thousand rupees per hectare to clean it.
And till the time the people who used to pick it up, they used to remain the same until they had taken the tractor-backet.
However, some farmers have proved that six-six, eight-eight pieces of this piece were piece and they were plundered into the ground.
The water that is in the throat keeps the crop alive.
Dear Countrymen, On the 3rd December, the International Day of Persons with DCA will be remembered all over the world.
During the past, we discussed the participants in Mann Ki Baat.
The Prime Minister also spoke of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Organ Donation.
On 2nd November, 2019, the Indian Organ Donation Day was announced.
Many well-known people including film actress Ravina Tandon joined the film.
Partnership can save valued lives.
Whenever a part of the body goes to the other body then that part gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this area and in the true sense, the needy will get the best help because this help cannot be provided until further.
I had earlier said that he is considered to be a day of distress on December 3.
Physically and mentally retarded people also have an unprecedented courage and capability.
He feels enjoyable whenever he gets pain.
Sometimes a sense of compassion and charity is expressed.
But if we change our attitude towards them by changing our vision then these people can inspire us to live.
You can inspire us to get rid of it.
Even if we have a small problem, we are going to cry.
Then it is remembered that my problem is very small, how does it feel
And that is why all these are the source of inspiration for us.
His biography is commendable to empower the way he can embark upon his life and the way he can empower him.
Today, I want to talk to him.
40-42 years of age.
In 1966, the terrorists fired a bullet in Jammu and Kashmir.
The ability to stand on his feet went on for a long time, but he did not accept the passing away of him.
They cannot be defeated even by the injury of terrorism.
The body does not support, but for 20 years they have been immersed in the study of children.
How to improve infrastructure for physically challenged people
How to develop systems for disorder in public offices
He is working on it.
He also turned his studies in that direction.
He has achieved his Master Degree in social work, and as a social worker, he is making a solemn revolution today, by becoming a vulnerable citizen.
Is not the life of Judeo enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I specially recall the life of Juvenile Ahmed on his penance and his dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, I would like to talk about jewellery, but in every corner of India, there are lamps of such inspiration.
The lives are spreading new lights, they are showing ways.
On the 3rd of December, there is an opportunity to inspire all of them by remembering them.
For the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the Dalit, the oppressed, the deprived, the deprived, the government has been continuously interacting with the government.
And as a citizen, somebody feels bad on behalf of a government babu.
And it changes our vision of looking at the government system for a lifetime.
Many times we don't even know because we are so comfortable that we don't know that any government system, any government servant is doing this thing.
ASHA workers in our country who are networks across the country.
You must have heard that we have never heard about Asha Workers among the people of India.
But I have become a witness to his success in the world as a world famous family enterprise of Bill Tables Foundation.
We shared our philosophy of such bill bills and Milinda Candidates.
He does a lot of social work in India.
The time of his retirement and the amount of money that he earns throughout his life is being used for the work of the poor.
In the last few days, the Government of Odisha has specially honoured an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
They have to go for treatment on the basis of the preliminary systems they have learnt.
Emphasis should be on every household using kitchen mosquitoes.
Mani Singh of Asha Varkar Jamuna has been working with full dedication to protect the entire village from mosquitoes just as his child is sleeping properly and as much as he should take care of.
He appealed to Maldives to meet the entire village.
How much money would be there
How many lakhs of people will be near us.
We will look at them with respect.
Such people become so vulnerable to our country.
The happiness of the society becomes such a big partner.
I express my gratitude to all such hope workers through jamunani.
In the context of inspiring incidents of an e-book Swachh Bharat, in the context of the ideal village of Parliament and in the field of health, in the context of health.
I urge you to see it.
See, not only this, but also others.
Read it and it can be possible that you have a feeling of adding some such things.
So you must be mygov.
Please send in.
These things are not very comfortable in our minds, but they can only be true for the society.
The biggest energy is positive.
You should also share good events.
You can become a social teacher in the true sense.
The temperature of the earth should not increase anymore.
It is also the responsibility and concern of everyone.
And this is the first way to avoid temperature.
14th December is the National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being run by the government.
Bulb schemes are underway.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, we should shut down the zero street lights and bathe for hours in the full moonlight.
It should feel the light of the moon.
When I got an opportunity to see a link from my friend, I felt that I told you this thing.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur does not seem to have got the privilege of studying more.
But they are doing such a thing that perhaps no one would have thought.
He is working to provide paddy to the poor by using solar energy.
He has created a committee of women and has set up a plant of solar energy fertilizers.
And they pay a fee of Rs. 100 per month.
People go to the financing in the evening and come back in the morning and get it for charging.
I have heard that 500 households are coming.
Now see what the world's greatest people will do for climate change, but a narrow pool inspires everyone.
And the meaning of Nurjahan is to publish the world.
They are spreading light through this work.
I congratulate the Nurjahan and also congratulate i TV because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the nation and the world.
Thank you very much.
I have received a phone call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh.
We want to know from the Prime Minister how these banks are supported by the adventurers like us.
Mudra promotes business enterprises.
Mudra creates opportunities for earning.
And Mudra empowers in a true sense.
This Mudra Yojana is going on to help small adults.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has been good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Whether it is smoking, sugarcane, reader or milk seller, small traders and I am happy that there are about 24 lakh women in 66 lakh women.
And most of those who get this help are SCs, STs, OBCs, who try to run their family with dignity by working hard themselves.
Abhishek himself has spoken of his enthusiasm.
I have several news reports.
Someone has just told me that there is a Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, he received a loan of Rs. 8.
He started the business of Suez Dress Safi.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhonsle explained.
He has brought a tannery, he is doing it and he has told me that in such a short span of time he has paid two lakh rupees to the bank.
This is the goal under our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier he used to earn more money.
And because of the earlier interest and due to other reasons, due to the higher expenditure incurred in their hands, about one thousand rupees per month have been saved.
And a good business of his family started growing gradually.
But I would like the scheme to be more propagated.
All our banks become more sensitive and help smaller people.
In fact, the economy of the country runs by these people.
People who do small things are economically impossible for the country.
We also want to emphasize on this.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
There are things against which there should be consistent awareness in the society.
What is the framework of the program
What is logo
How to increase folk participation
I had asked for all these suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are being made.
But I still look forward to further suggestions.
I expect a lot of chocolate schemes.
And I have been told that the participants will get certificates.
Some big prizes have been announced.
You also run your creative mind.
This mantra of unity integrity can be made a mantra of Ek Bharat, Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat.
Whether it is a living or a dignified person, whether it is a living person or a living person, whether it is easy to connect with everyone, what should the government do
What does society do
What should a civil society do
There can be many things.
I am confident that your suggestions will be used.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter has come.
I would like to urge you to exercise this good weather for some time to keep your body healthy.
And that is why we should create an environment in the family, it should be a festival of the family, it should be done in one hour together.
You see what kind of consciousness comes and how much the body supports the whole day.
If there is a good weather then there is a good habit.
Greetings to my dear countrymen once again.
Jaihind...
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
Once again, I have the privilege of connecting with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India and South Africa are going to commemorate the fifth one day match between India and South Africa.
This category has been named Gandhi-Mandela category.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased greatly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I want to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Kendra of Akashwani.
I would like that if such climate centres across the country pay attention to such aware and active people in their respective areas then our aim of running the country with a folk participation will get a new strength.
And that is why I convey my best wishes to all the friends of the Kannur Akashwani Kendra.
The students of St. Mary Upper Primary School of Chittor in Kerala have written to me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
Initially, these children have produced a picture of Mother India with the marks of their thirst.
I have sent a picture of the map of India.
Earlier, I was very young to see why they had made India's map with the print of their trumpet.
However, when I read his letter, I came to know that he had given him a good dedicated message.
These are the children who have just tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is campaigning for public participation.
He also laid the foundation stone of drama at various places so that people can understand the share.
Participation becomes a trend and activity.
These children have written to me in the letter that you appeal to people about your participants in your mindset.
He says the participants should make a festival.
Recently, I have received a lot of messages on phone calls.
Debesh ji of Delhi has also given me such a message.
The Government has taken a very fruitful step towards the ambitious goal of donating ones share by one and ten lakh persons.
I feel this thing is very important.
More than two and a half lakh kidneys, heart and liver are required every year in the country.
But in the country of 1. 25 billion we can achieve only five thousand transplants.
One lakh eyes are required every year.
And we can reach up to twenty five thousand.
We can only give one in front of the requirement of four eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a good effort to reduce the lease of writing.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront of Organ donation.
Several social organisations and many voluntary organizations have been working well in this direction.
National Organ and Technical Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been set up to promote organ transplant transplantation.
A Helpline 1800 1140 service is also available for twenty four hours.
And we have been told there that hence hence brotherhood.
This is a very good description of the joy of abandoning.
A few days ago, we all had seen on TV that Delhi's Jee.
And that surgery was successful.
There's a moment left.
Let us reaffirm the spirit of sweetness and brighten this thing.
Ladies and gentlemen, recently we celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days we will also celebrate the festival of Deepavali.
Id also celebrated and celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
India-Africa Foreign Summit is being organised in New Delhi tomorrow from 26th to 2nd October.
This is the first time that India is being organized at such a large level.
The Chauppan African countries and the leaders of the Unions have been invited.
A meeting of the largest convention of African countries is being held outside Africa.
The relationship between India and Africa is deep.
The number of people that India has is the same population of African countries.
And if we get both, we are the third largest in the world.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago it was the same hunger.
Later these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
We have a good commitment to natural resources.
And nearly 2 lakh people of India have lived in this country for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural and political ties.
But India plays a very important role in educating the youth of the most African countries.
More than 25,000 African students are studying in India.
Today, many leaders of African countries are those who have studied in India.
We don't know how deep we are
And that is why the Summit is of immense importance.
Generally, when the Summit is held, the heads of different countries are found.
Similarly, the summit will have a meeting of the leaders.
But it is our endeavor that people should also meet in it.
About 100 schools participated in it.
It also included schools outside India and India.
And thousands of thousands of school children have written about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition titled 'Memories of Mahatma' from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is reaching Delhi on 22nd October from Porbandar to the Northern states.
Millions of children from the school witnessed the exhibition.
The people of the village witnessed and how Mahatma Gandhi had played a great role in the relationship between Africa and India, how the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality was on the landscape.
Children from schools in our small places are also very excited, how wide their eyes are and how deep they think.
However, the summit is of India-Africa, but we can clearly see the opportunity to connect the people.
I congratulate all the children participating in the competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time on 15th August, I had made a resolution on the MPADAY scheme.
Thereafter, many MP friends have fulfilled this task.
They were very confused.
A workshop was organised in Bhopal last month.
This ideal village is being built in it, the Sarpanch, the collector there, some MPs from there, the government of India, the state government, all of them together discussed the issue of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Several new things were noticed and very enthusiastic things were discovered.
I want to bring some of these things to your attention.
Jharkhand, in a way, is a very big region and tribal region.
He chose to make Parsi Gram Panchayat an ideal village in Kunti district of Jharkhand.
It was also difficult for government employees to go there.
I congratulate the Hon'ble Member of Parliament, Shriman Karia Mundaji.
And that school in a way provides education for children in the morning and education for children in the evening.
And these children taught about five hundred fifty neighbours and taught them.
Friends, We can see that there is no guaranteed system in the society, no paper, no special system, but a big change that can be brought about by the will of the country through Gram Panchayat.
This village is well known for the production of sugarcane and for the kurtay jaggery in the state.
Shriman Ruvala ji started the Kurtayi Gulmardi festival in this village on 11th March.
People of old public life also came.
The government officials who worked there also came and an exhibition was also organized to increase the sale of sugarcane.
He said how the village can be made a hub of economic activity, and how the village can sell only its products.
Shri Ruvalaji is actually acknowledging the efforts of Adarsh village to build a self-reliant village.
My dear brothers and sisters, be it a matter of mind or be it cleanliness or not
Mumbai Savita Rai has sent me a message through a telephone and we have cleaned our homes every year for the preparation of Diwali.
This day, along with our homes, we should also make the outside environment clean and keep it clean even after Diwali.
He has paid attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I want to remind you of the fact that after the festivals of Diwali last year, our country, especially the media had run a big leap and whenever there was a scarcity of garbage after Diwali, all these things were not correct.
All the media had launched a campaign of awareness.
And the result was that a sufficient campaign was started immediately after Diwali.
Savita ji is right that we should take the kind of anxiety before the festival even after the festival.
Every public event should be done.
And today I want to especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
On October 2nd, I was fortunate to participate in the supplementary conference organized by the India Today Group on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary and one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
He gave the Clean India Awards and I also saw how many activities are going on.
For this, the people of KWK are themselves working as One Like One Mission.
What are the places in our country that have been kept so clean.
All these things came to light and I conveyed my heartfelt gratitude to the commendable work of the India Today Group at that time.
He has been encouraging cleanliness for the last one year through e-TV.
He added that about 51 lakh children from around 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana are connected to this work.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals or gardens, a massive campaign of cleanliness has been run in many places.
Now this news shows itself the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat.
The mission of Clean India is hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of newspapers, I cannot take the name of everyone without time, but everyone has run this campaign.
And therefore, as per the suggestions made by Savita Rai Ji, today the entire country is considering this thing as its own and is pushing it forward.
I have written a letter to Hon'ble Governor of Meghalaya, Hon'ble Shanmugnath.
And by that letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the past few years, this village has raised the challenge of cleanliness, and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he received the award from Asia's cleanest village.
I am glad to hear that there is a village in Meghalaya in the remote Northeast of our country which has been engaged in the field of Safai for years.
This has become the nature of the citizens of that place and the culture of the village has become.
This is the only thing that gives us confidence that our country will definitely become clean.
When we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will be able to take out our chests and say that we have freed our mother India from filth, my dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that something like this has happened.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he does not know for anybody's recommendation.
I have never heard that there is a psychological disorder in the world that takes care of someone in a two-minute interview.
And I had announced that why shouldn't we eradicate the convention of Interview for smaller rankings
My young friends, today I am proud to say that the government has completed all the procedures and now we will not be able to intervene on the grounds of Group D Group C and Group B non-gazetted posts of the Union Government.
The Rule will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
We will not make any hurdles in the process that is currently underway, but it will be implemented from 1st January 2016.
My best wishes to your young friends.
Similarly, we had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country in a way.
Gold is considered to be the medium of economic security.
Crisis of time is considered to be of gold.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in Goldback and the bank will pay you interest on it.
Earlier we used to keep gold in the fold and we had to pay the rent for the folks.
Now I will put the gold in the bank and the bank will pay you in the form of interest.
Speak patriots can no longer become wealth of gold
Whether the death of gold can be changed in the form of a living force or not
We have to do the same thing and give me support.
Now don't keep gold at home.
Its security and its interpretation. Two benefits.
Take a certain advantage.
There is another scheme: Sovereign Gold Bond does not have a gold link in your hands, but a paper comes.
However, the price of this paper is as much as a gold piece and the same amount will be paid to you on the day you return this paper.
So we are launching these schemes.
Now we do not have to buy gold.
I will present this security guarantee scheme to the countrymen next week.
I am glad to say that we are also bringing gold coins with Ashoka cycle.
Our freedom has been nearly 70 years but till now we have been using a foreign gold one or even a gold billion twelve.
Why should not our country be indigenous marks
Therefore, in the coming weeks and in the next few weeks, the money will be available to the common man. Five grams and 10 grams of Ashoka cycle of Indian gold are being started.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new transformation in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
One India, the best India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is remembered by the maps of unbroken India.
This great man has contributed immensely to India's unity.
I have familiarized my potential as a iron man.
We will pay homage to Sardar Saheb, but his dream of uniting India was that he had primarily shown it, but this mantra of unity should constantly become the medium of our thinking, behaviour and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Our country, and this diversity is full of diversity, many dialects, many species, dresses and diversity.
If there is no diversity then perhaps the beauty we have taken pride or not.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity, this is the path of development.
Over the last few years, the Run for Unity programmes of the country are being organized on 31st October.
I have heard that this time too it is being organized all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for unity.
The race for unity is in the true sense of development.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a race for unity.
Come, pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Please take forward the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I have to visit Britain.
I am very thrilled for my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also provide scholarships to such sections of the society, be it Dalits, Tribals or Backward Classes, to those who go abroad.
I am confident that when our children of India will study in Britain, this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them.
Therefore, I am saying that I am particularly thrilled about my visit to Britain.
And now that building should be the wealth of crores of countrymen, with which Babasaheb Ambedkar's name is added, you can imagine how happy people like me will be.
I want to get another opportunity in London and unveil the statue of Lord Basweshwar.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Basweshwar had done for democracy and women empowerment is really a testimony to the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Basweshwar to the household of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India thought and thought centuries ago.
You know, when such incidents are connected, we all feel thrilled in the minds of the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, you must be associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Your letters are later discussed on the skyscrapers.
There are discussions with government officials.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
However, a good relationship has been created between us.
I was completing one year while passing.
Today we are entering the New Year.
My best wishes to my countrymen once again.
Jaihind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, you all are Namaskar.
There is a fundamental idea in my life and because of this I have been very confident of the people's power but I can say that the peoples power is more than what they have taught me, what they have understood.
Our ancestors used to say that the Jan Jan Dhan is a part of this god.
I can say with my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that there is immense strength in the thoughts of our ancestors, because I have realized that I had a suggestion for Mann Ki Baat and could only talk about two or four suggestions every time but lakhs of people used to give me suggestions, this is a great power.
Yes, these lakhs of letters gave me a big boost.
Different departments of the government analyzed the letters of the people and what is the matter of policy, what is the personal question, which is not in the mind of the government.
Who thinks that the source of these information will become a matter of mind
One day I had said that selfie with a doctor and the whole world was surprised.
Perhaps in all the countries of the world, somebody has lost lakhs of selfie with the doctor and the daughter.
And when he used to do a selfie with a doctor, he used to enhance his daughter's zeal, but he used to create commitment within himself.
Even when people were watching, they felt that the neglect of daughters would have to be tempted.
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in mind the tourism of India, I had told the same citizens that if you go to Incredible India, if there is any good news then I will see it.
The tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the State Government has never thought that we have such a beautiful legacy.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Isn't there any demand of time now that the Khadi for fashion is there
Today, I am very satisfied that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
On a TV channel, I had seen that an retired teacher was standing on a widowed lady line to release subsidy.
The common man of the society, middle class, lower middle class, for which it is difficult to leave the subsidy, but such people have left it.
Is not this a soft revolution
Is not this the philosophy of people 's power
Governments will also have to learn that the work that is done in our government offices is a powerful, energetic and determined society of a great manpower outside Umbrah.
We made every small thing ourselves and tried to connect ourselves with the good of the country.
What can be a big sadness with this .
This time I thought of doing a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I had called upon the citizens of the country to telephone your questions and suggestions.
I will pay attention to this in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a pleasant experience.
People of all ages have given a message.
I liked to hear some messages myself and I felt good.
My team is working on the rest.
You might have taken a minute or two minutes but your phone call for me is very important.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
But one thing was amazing for me and was enjoyable.
However, it seems that there is negativeness and negativeness on all four sides.
But my experience was different.
Thousands of people had to say this thing in their own way.
However, I am surprised that all these things were similar to that of Mann Ki Baat.
Completely positive, positive, creative.
People have said that more than 70 of the remaining energy will be filled with energy.
They must listen to the radio.
I was conscious of the importance of radio for the visually impaired.
I see a new dimension and say such good things, these people and the government are sufficient to sensitize.
I have a message from Alwar Rajasthan on Pawan Acharya.
Listen to what they want to say - Definitely listen - "Marma is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
Pawan, I am confident that like Pawan, your feelings will definitely reach every corner of India and will be defeated.
We have suggested that the soil should not be priceless and that is why the lamps of the soil are also priceless.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the army personnel.
Whether it is our Navy, the Air Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Navy, the Air Force.
The war that took place in 165, completed 50 years with Pakistan.
He has constructed a Suryanjali Exhibition near Andia Gate in Delhi on this occasion.
If we look at it from the point of view of history then we can learn a lot. And if we look for inspiration in life then perhaps there cannot be any greater inspiration than this for serving motherland.
Whether it is the battle of Hajipir, the real north or the Chamunda or the visions of winning the Hajipir, it is thrilling and pride for our soldiers.
I also met those brave families and those who took part in the war are now in the Northern region of life.
If you want to make history then it is important to understand history deeply.
I have returned in two and a half hours but you will need three-four hours.
Look at the strength of democracy, a small child has commanded the Prime Minister, but the child has forgotten to call his name in the past.
We should also create a habit of cleanliness and also create a system for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction from the message of this child.
I also have to hear a lot.
I am sure that the Parliament of the country is also discussing India's cleanliness.
On the other hand, on the one hand, the Parliament on the one hand and on the other, both the children of this country talk about cleanliness - what can be the good fortune of this big country
The movement that is going on is aimed at ensuring that the atmosphere of salvation towards dirt is becoming aware of hygiene, it will also enable the governments to work.
We should work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi in 2017, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. And you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once he said - if I want to choose one of the two freedoms and cleanliness then I would like to select cleanliness first. After independence, even more important was cleanliness for Gandhi.
From Delhi, Lulshan Aroraji has given a message on May.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the life of great men is always a source of inspiration for us.
And it is not our job to valuate the idea of the great man.
Take out any date, no one will get the name of a great man from the clutches of history.
In the coming days, let us remember all these great men, let us send a message of their lives to our homes, and let us also try to learn something from them.
I specially urge you to once again for 2 October.
2 October is the birth anniversary of Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
I had also said in the last year that you will have all kinds of fashion clothes, all kinds of fabrics, but there should also be a place for Khadi.
I once again said that from 2nd October to 1 month Khadi is free.
We should take advantage of this.
And the handlooms should also be given equal importance along with Khadi.
And that is why we must give Khadi a place in our homes and place it on our body.
And while looking at it, the sales almost doubled.
Such poor people have benefited.
You people have made the work that the government cannot do with the announcement of billions of rupees with small help.
This is the manpower and therefore I once again urge you to do this thing.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy with one thing.
You should also get some taste of this happiness.
I had gone to Kolkata in the month of May and I had come to meet the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
His friend Chandra Bose had organized everything.
I had got the opportunity to spend a happy evening with the family members of Subhash Babu for a long time.
You can imagine how happy will be for me .
Netaji's family may have come together for the first time in his life.
But it is a matter of great happiness for me that there has never been any privilege of such hospitality in the Prime Minister's residence, which I can get in October.
More than 50 people of Subhash Babu and the entire family live in different countries.
I got a message from Bhargavi Kanda and listening to it and listening to it, I felt that it looks like a leader and perhaps it will become a leader.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to make a statement to the Prime Minister that you awaken the younger generation about water registration so that in the coming days, the participation of the younger generation is increased and the important support of the younger generation is being chosen and run by the government.
Every voter in the democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is growing gradually.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Election Commission is acting as a mere regulator, but in the last few years, there has been a major change in it.
Today, our Election Commission is not just a regulator, it has become a facilitator - it has become a voter friend and it has been a big change in all its ideas and ideas.
The voter list should be upgraded and we should also keep checking.
I am in the fray for the first time that after the first polling, water will be supplied.
Everyone should do what sacred work is.
On the ultimate day, I visited Kashi.
I got a seventh class student named Kshitij Pandey.
It is the seventh standard in the Central University in Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is a very sharp intellect.
But in such a young age, I have seen his interest in the research of physics.
He was talking about how the sensibilities in robots came and he was very proud.
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child .
How to do
When
This child should ask his mind.
Similarly, I had to meet Sonam Patel with a very small child.
Nine years old.
This daughter of Sundarpur resident of Varanasi, Sadabrij Patel, is the daughter of a very poor family and I was surprised that the child is a blessed person.
But the biggest thing I felt that when I asked him, he used to call him Shalok, used to speak in English, used to define him, used to speak in Hindi.
Only the songs read or the other is broken .
When we take history, we all face it in the evening.
We all are surprised to see how they are so talented in the entire family.
I was really very impressed.
Sometimes children are suffering from celebrity, but Sonam had nothing to do with it.
We have done a lot of work in addition to what you have seen on TV and read in newspapers and sometimes these things are also enjoyed.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that some people bring a lot of work for me in Mann Ki Baat.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
I have to be so frustrated to do this once in a month, I have to wait so much on time.
Sometimes my friends of Akashwani have to wait for half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
I am grateful to you for your suggestions.
Today it is just a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how much language uses Babu radio
From Germany, he started his radio, and he continued to inspire the citizens of India through radio in relation to the freedom movement.
He launched the freedom movement from a weekly News bulletin.
He used to run this radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto, Urdu.
It has been a year since I spoke of Mann Ki Baat on the sky.
This is my satisfaction.
I will meet again for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You keep sending suggestions.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
Amendments begin.
Your contribution is valuable for me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modis Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Once again I have got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
People are celebrating the festival of Onam in the regions of Sudur and the entire nation celebrated the sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan yesterday.
In line with social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short time, everyone has accepted these schemes in a big way.
I had made a small request that we should give this security scheme to our sisters on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
The primary information that I have received from me is that from the beginning of this scheme till date, 115 crore families have joined this scheme.
Moreover, I was also told that about half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I believe this is a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a large scale.
The work that has not been done for sixty years will be done in such a short time .
I also saw the embarrassment of the poor
The new balance was to open accounts.
But the poor saved Rs.
The youth have been employed.
You will be glad to know that in this one year, about one lakh Financial Literacy Camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Not just to stop opening of accounts.
And now thousands of people have become officers of overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it
And there was a belief that the poor could get money from the bank.
I have brought it to you and it is your job to keep it.
All of us should be active in the accounts.
You must do this, I am confident.
In the last few days, the incidents of Gujarat have made the entire country restless.
But in a very short span of time all my brave citizens of Gujarat took care of the situation.
The situation had played an active role before the disaster and once again Gujarat started on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brothers, this is the right path.
And we have to walk on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the last few days, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I have got the opportunity to hear about the kind of things that I have experienced in a way that a music is playing in a way.
I felt very good.
Perhaps it is the most important thing to realize the true nature of Islam in the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition which is associated with love and liberty will bring this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also tell others that if we believe in any community, we should sometimes understand the Sufi tradition.
I am fortunate to have another opportunity in the coming days and I am fortunate to have this invitation.
In India, scholars of the Buddhist tradition of many countries of the world are going to come to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, had gone to Bodhgaya.
I want to get the opportunity to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear Kisan brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you about Mann Ki Baat.
I have mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat earlier.
I must have heard in the Parliament, heard in public meetings, heard in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mind is open on the issue of the debate regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the interest of Kisan and I have repeatedly said that.
But today I want to tell my Kisan brothers and sisters that the issue of reforms in the Land Acquisition Act has come through the states and they have come forward that if the village and the poor farmers want to make a river for water supply to the fields, they will have to take a pilgrimage to provide electricity to the villages, they will have to construct a road for the villages, they will have to build houses for the poor people of the village, they will have to provide employment to the poor youth of the village.
And then there was a proposal for reforms.
But I saw that the fear was spread so much that Kisan was so scared.
My dear brothers and sisters, my kisan should not be confused, and if you are afraid then you should not be a slave.
And I don't want to give any such opportunity to anyone who fears kisses and disdains kisses.
We presented an Ordinance.
Ordinances are being completed on the 21st of August, 2019.
And I have decided to finish it.
The situation before my government was formed has now been re-established.
But one work was incomplete.
And that is why we brought them in the Ordinance, but due to these disputes, these cases have also been misled.
And I assure my Kisan brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a slogan for us.
Villages, poor lives.
And that is why on 15th August, I had said that not only the Agriculture Department but the Kisan and Welfare Department will be formed.
And when it comes to the war of 165, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural to remember Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan Mantra.
It is also very natural to remember the Tricolour of India and all those martyrs who have maintained their blessings.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 165th War.
I am glad that India is doing a very good job in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these researches to the masses.
How to convert principles into instruments
How to connect the lab with the land
It has to be carried forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also a very important interaction for me.
And when I had recently said in Mann Ki Baat that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting I feel that there is a lot of opportunity and there are many possibilities.
I get several letters from the citizens.
Skill development has been written.
Shri Prakash Tripathi from Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu has stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I have also conveyed one thing to my young friends.
On 15th August I had said from above the Red Fort that why is the interview for low level jobs
And when the Interview Coal comes, then every poor family, a widow, a guaranteed person, who will get a job
The poor don't have to run for implementation.
No exploitation, no action.
These days, many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially for mother-son and child-survival, call-to-action for its work was discussed by the twenty-four countries of the world on the ground of India.
This was the first time in any other country outside the USA.
However, there has been a lot of improvement.
India's admiration at the international level, yet these figures are not small.
Just as we got rid of the police, we also got rid of the tetanus in the deaths of mothers and children.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, today the news of dengue is going on.
I am sure that dengue is dangerous but its savings are very easy.
And the Swachh Bharat that I am talking about is directly linked to it.
We need advertising on TV.
There is a widespread public education in this regard, but we do not care.
I would urge all of you to say that we should not make such a cost of death.
Life is very valued.
Discrimination about water, satisfaction of sanitation, becomes a cause of death, is not correct.
Free dengue testing facilities are available at around five hundred four centres across the country.
Cleanliness should be given great importance.
These days there is a festival in our country in a way from Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali.
Why should not all our festivals be connected with cleanliness now
You see, Sanskrit will become the nature
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, but in his heart, the spirit of serving the tribals of India is strong.
Both of these brothers have enhanced India's pride.
These two brothers won this race this year.
Indias honour has increased.
I convey my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am extremely delighted to know that this entire expedition of Team India - Vision for Tribals is being done with the intention of empowering the tribal people.
See, what kind of efforts everybody is making to push the country forward
Whenever we hear such incidents, the chest bloats.
Sometimes, due to perspective, we commit great injustice to our youth.
My experience regarding youth is different.
Sometimes we also get a lot of learning when we talk to the youngsters.
I have met many youngsters who say: "Brothers and sisters, I have enjoyed life on hand.
Some people say that I have kept on a single day of the week.
Today, I specially want to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
The new Government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand, divine and inspirational memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar, which is now to be built by the Government of Maharashtra, will be our inspiration.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen, Nanaji.
After a long distance, once again, we are launching Mann Ki Baat, Mann Ki Baat, Peoples talk, Lokmanya.
He used to listen, repeat, listen and repeat, and sometimes our thoughts became inspiring for us.
You can imagine how it would have been a mid-term period.
Perhaps this was not a live programme.
I was missing something at every moment. And when I speak Mann Ki Baat, I may say that the words are mine, the voices are mine but the story is yours, the meaning of man is yours, the record is yours.
I used to use only my words and words and because of that I was missing you and not the programme.
It was an empty experience.
But watching this Sunday a lot.
Well, there has been a lot of opportunity.
In a family ecosystem, Mann Ki Baat, Minority, Minority, Societies and Life are the causes of change.
In a way, this sequence will give rise to a new spirit and in a way support the realization of a New India.
I feel spirituality.
Sometimes I feel that this is my self-confidence journey.
This is my journey from Ahmedabad to May.
For me, this Moon Dialogue with you was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath in the election race.
Maximum people have drawn political meaning from it.
It was an opportunity for me to meet me.
The rest is your curiosity, I think we will ever discuss it.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in the same way, your efforts to inspire a positive thing, I feel continually in your thoughts.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat are totally different from regular government work.
Sometimes the work of pushing forward my thought process makes some of your words.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is showing his slogans against dirt but he also expresses his efforts towards cleanliness.
If someone talks about the environment, he feels the pain, but at the same time, he also tells the experiments he has seen and he also paints the imaginations he has in his mind.
That is, in a way, I feel the glimpse of how socio-economic solutions can be solved.
Mann Ki Baat is like an arrow for the country and society.
It shows us that there is no dearth of inner strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
The need is to strengthen and incorporate talent, provide opportunities and activate it.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that all 130 crore countrymen want to join the development of the country firmly and actively. And I must say that I have received so many letters in Mann Ki Baat, so much telephone calls, so much message is received, but the grievances are very low and if someone wants something for himself then I have not noticed in the last five years.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how happy my heart might be, how much energy should I get.
You have brought me, you have left me alone and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, we will take forward the process of Mann Ki Baat.
When there was a crisis in the country, the opposition was not limited to the political sector alone, it was not limited to politicians.
There was an outbreak in the minds of the people.
There was a thirst for the lost democracy.
When we eat food on a day or night, we dont know what hunger is there, just as we know what is the joy of democratic rights in normal life, when we snatch away some democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country had felt that something has been snatched.
Perhaps in any country of the world, everybody of that country has voted for democracy only if they do not lose their rights, rights and requirements.
Recently, the Mahaparva of the democracy, a massive election campaign was concluded in our country. From Amir to the poor, everybody was happy to share the future of our country with happiness.
Whenever any challenge is very close to us, we underestimate its significance, its amazing facts are also ignored.
This number can be very common to us, but if I tell you from the point of view of the world, if we leave China then more than any country in the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost two times.
The number of voters in India is more than the population of entire Europe.
It reflects the vastness and comprehension of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were the world's largest democracies in history.
You can imagine how massive levels of resources and manpower will be required to complete this election.
The election of lakhs of teachers, officers and employees could be possible through hard work day and night.
While nearly 3 lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have fulfilled their responsibilities, 20 lakh police personnel from different states have also tested their hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time too much voting took place.
You can imagine about 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 1 lakh VVPAT machines in the country.
All this has been done so that it can be ensured that no voters are deprived of their votes.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one female polling station was constructed.
You will be surprised to know that the officials of the Election Commission have to travel there for two or three days - this is the true honor of democracy.
India also has the highest number of polling stations in the world.
The polling station is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti sector of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is also another pride filled up in this election.
Perhaps for the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm just like men.
The percentage of voting for women and men in this election was almost the same.
One more enthusiastic aspect of this thing is that today the record 8 is a woman MP in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the electoral process and salute the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth that "Buke no Book" was my urge to give us books instead of flowers in welcome.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Someone recently gave me a book named Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniya, I felt very good.
Though it was not possible for a long time, but during the tour I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
Their legends, their expression of human emotions in a simple language also touched my heart.
Their legends encompass the spirit of the entire India.
When I was reading his story of intoxicating intoxication, my mind was going on in my own way on the economic dissensions spread in the society.
I was reminded of the days of my youth how discussions were held overnight on this subject.
The son of the landlord, Ishwari and the brave heart of the poor family are taught that if you are not cautious then when the impact of the bad world falls, it is not known.
The second time that touched my heart was Idgah.
A child's sensitivity, his love for the sake of it, his feelings of equality in such a young age.
When the 4-5 year old Hamid takes a chip from the fair and reaches his grandfather, he really reaches the peak of his human emotions.
The story showed a live picture of the problem of the lives of the poor farmers.
Despite their crops being destroyed, the small farmers are so happy that they do not have to sleep in the fields in the extreme cold.
Though this is about a century ago, its relevance still feels the same.
After reading this, I got a different kind of experience.
When it comes to reading, I used to read about Kerala's letter library in a media.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village located in the dense forests of Idukki.
The primary school teacher, P.
Both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by tied in Potala and ladies on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone along with the tribal children.
The 'Vanche Gujarat' campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat.
Millions of people in the age group participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, in the times of the guru, I would also urge you to take some time out and give the books a place in your daily daily routine.
You will actually enjoy and write on the Narendra Modi app about the books that you read so that every listener of Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the issue which is a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf, several people have written to me about the water related challenges.
Water has a lot of importance in our culture.
The Ap: Suktam of Rig Veda mentions about water, , , , i. e.
Your grace keeps on showing us year after year.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are affected every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received from the rains in the entire year is saved in our country.
Only 8 percent.
Now the time has come to resolve this problem.
I am confident that like many other problems, we will also solve this problem with the efficiency, co-operation and resolve of 1.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been formed in the country.
This will take quick decisions on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote letters to the Sarpanches across the country, to the Gram Pradhans.
I have written to the village Prime Ministers that to save water, to save water, to save rain water, to save rain water, they should address the Gram Sabha meeting and discuss with the villagers.
I am glad that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month crores of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
In villages, people took a pledge to collect one drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
My best wishes to every village Prime Minister and every Sarpanch for their activity.
There are several such Sarpanches across the country which have taken the lead in water conservation.
In a way, this opportunity of the entire village has been created.
It seems that the people of the village are now engaged in the competition to build a water temple in their villages.
As I said, many positive results of collective efforts can be achieved.
There cannot be a single formula for water conservation across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But everyone's goal is one and that is water conservation.
Trainage lines are being restored in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging.
The construction of a tank in Telangana's Themipalli is changing the lives of the people of the village.
A major transformation has come from the small ponds built in the fields in Kabirdham, Rajasthan.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who have been working very well on the Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that several such efforts have been made and when we are united and striving hard, we can make the impossible possible.
When people will join, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I appeal to the countrymen 3.
My first request is: Just as the countrymen gave the form of a mass movement to cleanliness, let us initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us resolve to save every drop of water together. And I am confident that water is a Prasad of Parameswar, water is a form of mercury.
Earlier it was said that the touch of mercury makes iron gold.
I say that water is mercury and mercury creates a new life by touching water.
Start a awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell them about water related problems as well as propagate water conservation measures.
I specially urge the stakeholders of different sectors to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is the field of films, sports, media, social organizations, people associated with cultural organisations, people associated with stories, everyone leads this movement in their own way.
It connects society with society instead of society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My countrymen, there are several traditional methods of water conservation in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Porbandar and Pujya Bapu then there is another house behind the house of Pujya Bapu. There are 200 years old water streams and even today there is water and there is a system of stopping rain water.
There will be several such experiments at every place.
Let us inspire people for water conservation by making a list of water conservation systems.
You can share your content using JanShakti4JalShaktiHistag.
My dear countrymen, I also express my gratitude for one thing and also thank the people of the world.
On 21st June, along with the activeness of Yoga Day, three-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day.
The spirit of Yoga is increasing in the awakening for Holistic Health Care.
If a Yoga lover welcomes it in every corner of the world as soon as the sun rises, then it is a complete journey till sunrise.
Perhaps there will be a place where there is no link between humanity and Yoga.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from aircraft to aircraft carriers, from AC gyms to the shrines, from villages to cities wherever possible not only Yoga was performed but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and common citizens of many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how he celebrated Yoga in his own country.
On that day, the world was looking like a very happy family.
We are confident that healthy and sensitive people are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures that.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
It was a matter of great satisfaction for me to announce Prime Ministers Awards for excellent contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2017.
This award has been conferred on organizations from all over the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly in the propaganda of Yoga.
For example, take the 'Japan Yoga Niketan' which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Several institutes and training courses run by Japan Yoga Niketan or Ms.
Antonietta Rozzzi, who started the 'Sarva Yoga International' and propagated Yoga throughout Europe.
This is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a matter related to Yoga, can Indians remain behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger have also been honoured and they have been dedicated to Yoga for several decades.
Likewise, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and established the Life Mission and Lucky Yoga University.
The extensive celebration of Yoga and the honour of those who brought home the message of Yoga, both made this Yoga day special.
It is a great journey for me to connect with your thoughts. Mann Ki Baat is perfect.
Let us keep on talking.
Keep listening to your feelings, staying right and understanding.
Sometimes he keeps trying to live up to his feelings.
Your blessings will continue.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Let us enjoy Mann Ki Baat and also fulfil the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, the mother of India had lost her dreams.
We have sacrificed our lives for the protection of millions of Indians.
Our brave sons had united day and night so that they could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in Pulwama's terrorist attack, the hearts of the people and the people of the whole country are shocked and angry.
There have been enormous sympathies for the martyrs and their families.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who saved their lives by protecting mother India.
We all have to face the challenges faced by the country by forgetting ideologies, communalism, territorialism and all other differences so that our movement against terrorism becomes stronger than ever before.
Our Armed Forces have been introducing unique architecture and curriculum from time to time.
He has shown extraordinary potential for peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also responded in their language.
You must have seen what steps have been taken in 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has pledged to eliminate the combination of terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the motivational issues of their family members have been given strength and strength to the entire nation.
The spirit that Ramniran ji, the father of Martyr Ratna Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, has inspired us all.
He said that he will also send his other daughters to fight against enemies, and if necessary, he will also fight himself.
The entire nation is saluting the indomitable courage of Meenaji, wife of the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has also pledged to fill one of his daughters in CRPF.
When Martyr Vijay Soren's grandfather died in Triuranga and reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his daughter-in-law said that I too would join the fountain.
The spirit of this season expresses the feelings of one child across India.
Such feelings are being seen in the houses of our brave martyrs.
I appeal to the younger generation to try to know and understand the spirit shown by these families.
We don't have to go to an ancient event of history.
On the App, Shri Omkar Shettyji, Udupi, Karnataka has expressed his happiness over the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was surprised that there was no national war memorial in India.
It is a memorable tribute to the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation.
I ensured that such a memorial in the country should be defined.
We decided to build a National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, we will dedicate this National Soldiers Memorial to our army.
The country will make a small effort to pay its debt.
A new memorial has been constructed just close to Delhi's Dil i. e.
I am confident that we will be able to visit this National Army Memorial at any place for the countrymen.
This is the National Military Memorial, a symbol of the gratitude of the nation towards those who made the highest sacrifice after independence.
The design of the memorial demonstrates the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The martyrdom of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the soldier.
The second is the Circle Bravery Cycle which showcases the courage and valour of the soldiers.
Thereafter there is a cycle of sacrifice.
The Circle showcases the sacrifice of soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who made the highest sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters.
Subsequently, the defence cycle demonstrates security.
The circle is covered by dense trees.
The National Military Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country with the aim of studying their gratitude.
Those who have laid down their lives for the country so that we can survive so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Armed Forces in the development of the country.
Last year in October, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea that we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women police who remain intact in our security.
I hope you will need to see the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments keep reading me through different means.
This time when I was reading your comments, I was reminded of a very interesting tip of Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He has written that when the British captured Birsa Munda on 3rd March in the year 2000, his age was only 25 years old.
Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshed ji on 3rd March.
He further states that both these personalities have come from a completely different family background, which enriched the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
In a way to pay homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, it is appropriate to salute the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great scholars have brought the name of Jharkhand, not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youngsters need some inspirational personality for guidance then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
When he was asleep, the British hid themselves and took them very carefully.
Do you know why the British took the help of such a carefree act
Because the British who raised such a huge empire were also afraid of them.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda has just ridiculed the British rule decorated with guns and cannons from his traditional austerity.
Indeed, when people get an inspirational leadership, the collective will power of the people on the strength of the braves is heavy.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight against the British for political freedom.
But they fought for socio-economic rights of the tribals.
They have done all this in their short life.
In the blind life of the underprivileged and the underprivileged, he shines like the sun.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the young age of 25.
India's mother's dreams like Birsa Munda have taken place in all parts of the country.
No one has contributed to the freedom struggle that lasted for centuries.
But fortunately, his words of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice have not reached the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda really realizes his dream, then a great personality like Jamshed ji Tata gave the country big institutions.
Jamshed ji was in true sense a vision that he not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He was very well aware that making India a hub of science technology and enterprises is essential for the future, it was his vision.
As a result, the Datta Institute of Science has been established which is now called the Indian Institute of Science (Indian Institute of Science).
Not only that, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, our country's former Prime Minister Morarji Bhai Desai was born on February 2nd.
You all know that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, the owner of a simple and peaceful personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
The record of introducing the highest number of stamps in Parliament in independent India is in the name of Morarjibhai Desai.
Morarji Desai led India in such a difficult time when the country's democratic tensions were threatened.
Morarjibhai Desai embarked upon a movement of democracies to protect democracy.
For this, they had to pay heavy prices even in the past.
The government of that time seized them and put them in jail.
But as soon as the Janta Party won the elections in 1991, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The amendment also envisaged that the default rate of fundamental rights under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be abolished.
For the first time, it was made that the President would announce the default only after the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and it was also decided that the deficit could not be increased by more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji ji ensured that the way the democracy was slaughtered in 15th century cannot be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in keeping the month of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, this year too, there was a lot of enthusiasm among the people about Padma awards.
Today, we are leading the path of a New India, in which we want to honour those people who are doing their jobs at the grassroots level.
Those who are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in a variety of ways for their hard work.
Indeed, he is a true worker who remains self-reliant in the service of the people, the society and all of them.
I want to tell you about such people.
Talking about Abdul Gafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job to revive the traditional disease color of Kutch.
He is doing a great job to bring this rare painting to a new generation.
The Tree of Life (Life Tree) created by Abdul Ghafoor was conferred on former US President Barak Obama.
Sayyid of Margarwad is known as the servant of Gaumata to receive Padma awards.
The way he has entrusted his entire life to the service of Goddess Gaudi is unique in itself.
You will be happy to hear about the Tao Porchon-Lynch of America. Lynch has become a living institution of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he is training Yoga across the globe and till now he has made 1. 5 thousand people Yoga teachers.
Jumuna Tudu, known as Lady Turson in Jharkhand, performed the brave task of confronting Timber's Mafia and Customers, not only saved 50 hectares of forest but also inspired ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is difficult to illustrate the work done for the upliftment of Divyang women, even though they themselves are Divyang, by establishing an institution called Pragyachakshya Mahila Sevakunj, they are working relentlessly to make the visually impaired children self-reliant.
He has presented an example in empowerment of women and making farming profitable.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 3000 women from their area to join the Self Help Groups to become economically empowered.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk about the experience that I have experienced for the past few days.
Today, whenever I go to the country, I have been trying to get the scheme of Ayushman Bharat to some beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, in the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I have seen how big changes are taking place in the lives of the poor.
If you all know any poor person who cannot get treatment without any money, tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time for examination in schools is about to begin.
Different education boards across the country will start functioning in the next few weeks for the examination of the 10th and 12th standard board.
My best wishes to all the students of the examiner, their parents and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a very big event was held in Delhi in the form of a Townhole.
The specialty of the exam-Pay discussion programme was that there were open discussions on different topics related to the examination.
Some aspects that can certainly be beneficial for the students.
All the students can see the entire programme on their parents and teachers on YouTube and convey my best wishes to all my examiners for the upcoming test.
My dear countrymen, be it a matter of India or be it a festival
There is no such day in our country which has no significance, which has no festival.
Because we have this legacy of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivaratri will take place. And this time Shivaratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, a special significance of it will be hidden in our temple.
My best wishes to you all on this auspicious occasion of Shivaratri.
My dear countrymen, I had gone to Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend time with Divyang brothers and sisters.
He said, I am grateful to the Prime Minister.
I was really impressed with the power of the Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, it is a unique experience for me to connect with you all through the programme of Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, I meet crores of families every month through Red Fort.
Sometimes, while talking to you, reading your letters or listening to the thoughts sent on the phone, I feel like giving me a part of my family.
This is a very pleasant moment for me.
Dosts are a big source of electoral democracy.
For the next two months we will be in the fray for all the elections.
And for years, I will continue to share my heart with you.
Once again I thank all of you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Nanaji, on the 21st of this month, the country has received a very sad news.
Shiv Kumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to society.
Lord Basweshwar has taught us - "It means fulfilling our responsibility by doing hard work, it is equal to being in the Kailash Dham, the residence of Lord Shiva.
His fame was as a scholar who had an unprecedented footprint on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He put his entire life behind the goal of providing food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
The welfare of the farmers in every way was the priority of Swamiji's life.
Siddhaganga Math was organizing animal and agricultural fairs regularly.
I have got the privilege of getting the blessings of Param Pooja Swamiji many times.
Kalamsaheb had written a poem for Pooja Swamiji on this occasion.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb reflects the life of Shri Shri Shiv Kumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is not only an integral part of our democracy but is also older than our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
There is no excuse in ensuring that every citizen of India who is a registered voter or registered voter gets an opportunity to vote.
When we hear that a polling station is set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15,000 feet above sea level, arrangements are made for voting in remote islands in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Only for a voter
When we hear these things, it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
Keeping in mind a voter, it gives an opportunity to the voters to use their voter, so that the entire team of employees of the Election Commission goes to the remote areas and arranges for voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continued efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, the Lok Sabha elections in our country will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
For them, the country's responsibility has come to its shoulders.
Now he is going to be a part of the decision-making process in the country.
It is time to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I appeal to the younger generation that if they are eligible to vote, they will surely register themselves as voters.
Every one of us should realise that becoming a voter in the country, achieving the right to vote is an important part of the important achievements of life.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote - this feeling should remain in us continuously.
There should be a lot of pain in life if there is no reason to vote.
If there is something wrong in the country then it should be sad.
I appeal to the renowned dignitaries of the country to create awareness among the people by campaigning for voting or voting on the day of polling.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will register as voters and will further strengthen our democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some unprecedented work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated his Jayanti with a different guess.
On Netaji's Jayanti, I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's struggle for independence.
You know that many rooms and buildings had been closed since independence in the Red Fort.
The closed rooms of the Red Fort have been converted into a very beautiful museum, the museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, the museum dedicated to the First Freedom Struggle of Yad-e-Jallian and 185-India, and the entire campus has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
In each brick of these museums, the aroma of our glorious history is available.
The poets of the museum inspire us to enter the history of our freedom fighters.
At this place, the British ruled over the brave sons of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon and General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji in the Kranti Mandir in the Red Fort, the family members of Netaji gave me a very special cap.
Netaji used to wear this cap.
It was in the museum that the people who visited the museum also looked at the cap and inspired the patriotism.
Indeed, the valour and patriotism of our heroes needs to be constantly transformed into a new generation.
Just a month ago, on 30th December, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In a programme, the tricolor flew the same place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had hoisted the tricolor five years ago.
Thus, when the tricolor was thrown at the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there were 15 such traditions there.
This is the occasion to mark the completion of 5 years of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organizer.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom.
Netaji has made a place in the hearts of every Indian with the compositions like 'Dilli Chalo', 'Tumumumuz Khan Dhoon, 'My Tumhin Azad Dunga'.
For many years it was believed that files related to Netaji should be made public and I am happy that we could do that thing.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
We together talked about a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road connected with Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you a case related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connecting people, just as Netaji had a close relationship with the radio and he also chose the radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhas Babu started the freedom movement and through the radio he interacted with the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and the people of the country.
I was told that the radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station is being managed by the State Government of Gujarat.
Vyas ji played a very important role.
The programmes being broadcast on the freedom movement were very popular among the common people and their programmes also boosted the warriors of our freedom struggle.
An art museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir.
This effort has been made to show the Indian art and culture in a very attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 paintings and artworks of the three centuries old.
Excellent works by great artists like Amrit Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnidra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloj Mukherjee have been exhibited in the museum.
And I will specially request you to visit there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that this thing is happening here and I am talking to you about the excellent work of Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made pictures on many topics.
He has also made pictures of animal birds, he has also made pictures of several beautiful birds, and after that he has also worked to bring human characters to the canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to most of his works.
He believed that those who see their paintings themselves should understand the paintings and see the message given by them in the paintings from their vision.
Their pictures have also been exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will definitely see their pictures in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of ethics, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas was one such saint.
1st February is Ravidas Jayanti.
The Doha of Saint Ravidas ji is very famous.
Saint Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if Lord is indeed in every human being, it is not appropriate to share them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the sacred land of Varanasi.
Saint Ravidas ji through his message tried to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire lifetime.
It is not wrong to say that he has explained to the world the true meaning of labour prestige.
He used to say, "Man Changa and Kathauti I Ganga means that if your mind and heart are pure then Sakshat Ishwar resides in your hearts.
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced the people of all walks of life, be it the queen of Chittor or the queen of Meerabai, all were his followers.
Once again I salute Saint Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Singh has written on MyGov that I have highlighted Indias space programme and its future aspects.
He also wanted me to persuade the students to take interest in space programmes and think of going beyond the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and specially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was Ahmedabad where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching the space.
The Kalam-Set made by our scholars has been launched on 24th January.
The sounding rockets made by the students of the university in Odisha have also made several records.
The same space mission has been started in the last four years since the independence of the country.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously with the same spacecraft.
We will soon recall Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is using space technologies in a beautiful way to protect lives.
Whether it is air or rail and road safety, there is a lot of support from space technologies.
Our fishermen brothers and sisters have been divided into Navic Devices which are helpful in their security as well as in economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve the delivery and response of government services.
In this scheme, about 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been tagged.
At the same time, about three and a half crore properties have also been tagged under Manrega.
Our satellites are a symbol of the country's growing strength today.
It contributes immensely to our good relations with many countries of the world.
The South Asia Satellite has been a unique initiative which has provided development to our neighbouring friends.
With the help of our competitive launch services, India today launches the satellites of not only the developing countries but also the developed countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programme gives children the opportunity to think big and move ahead from the boundaries which were considered incredible till date.
It is a vision for our children to continue to watch stars and inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that those who will play will play it and many youngsters and youngsters have come forward in the Khelo India this time.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games in the India Youth Games in Pune in January.
When the player will perform well at the local level, he will also perform well at the global level.
This time, in Khelo India, the players of every state have performed well at their own level.
The lives of many medal winners are inspiring.
In Mukkabaji, young player Akash Gorakha won the book, I was reading that Akash's father Ramesh Ji works as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shadow with his family.
So, the curtailment of 21 women composer teams of Maharashtra remains a golden helivine star.
He lost his father in very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonalina Hunar.
It is often seen that in sports such as cable, the daughters do not get so much encouragement.
Despite this, Sonali chose and performed excellently.
The 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw of Asanasol is the youngest gold medalist in the Khelo India Youth Games.
In Karnataka, a farmer's daughter Akshay Baaswati won a golden moonlight in weightlifting.
When we talk about the creation of India then it is the resolve of the youth power that is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India are showing that people of not only big cities contribute to the creation of a New India, but people from small towns and villages, youth, youth, talent and talent also contribute a lot to them.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about a lot of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard about the competition to shine the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have participated in a unique competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
This unique competition is called Swachh Sunder Tower.
You will also be able to see several pictures of a clean toilet from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Kamrup on social media.
I call upon all Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
Definitely share your clean beautiful toilet with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On 2nd October, 2014, we had started a memorable journey together to free our country from cleanliness and open defecation.
Today, with the support of the people of India, India is moving towards open defecation long before 2nd October, 2019, to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
In this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat, the sportspersons of Mann Ki Baat have also been contributing immensely. And therefore, I am happy to share with you that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 6000 districts have freed themselves from open defecation and have crossed 8 of the sanitation coverage in rural India and about nine crore households have been provided toilet facilities.
My young friends and exams will be the days.
The resident of Himachal Pradesh, MyGov, has written that I should talk about exams and exam warriors.
Abdul ji, I thank you for raising these issues.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the period of examination.
Students, from their parents to teachers, many people are engaged in exams related work.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to discuss this programme of Mann Ki Baat today, but you would be glad to know that after two days, I would like to interact with students from all over the country at the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme on 21st January at 11 a.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this programme.
All aspects related to the exams, particularly with my young friends in relation to stress free testing.
I had requested people to send inputs and ideas for this and I am very happy that a large number of people are putting their thoughts on MyGov.
Some of these ideas and suggestions will be kept in front of you during the specific town hall program.
You must be part of this program...
You will also be able to see its livelihood through social media and namopathy.
My dear countrymen, on 30th January, the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
The entire nation pays homage to the martyrs at 11 o'clock.
Wherever we are, we must pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes.
Let us move forward with this pledge to remember Bapu and fulfill the dreams of venerable Bapu, build a New India, as a citizen.
Make this journey of 2019 successfully.
My best wishes to you all and thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do to transform our lives and contribute to taking forward the country and the society
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
You must have thought how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to remember how India will remember 2019 as a nation, how it will be able to commemorate it as a hundred thirty crore people.
It brings glory to us all.
In 2018, the worlds largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was launched.
Electricity has reached every village in the country.
The world's renowned organisations believe that India is providing freedom to the country from poverty at a record pace.
With the resolve of the countrymen, cleanliness coverage is increasing to 5.
After independence, for the first time from the Red Fort, the Tricolor should be held on the 5th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The Statue of Unity, the world's highest statue in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who served the country in the direction of unity.
The country's name was high in the world.
The nation was honoured with the highest environmental awards of the United Nations Champions of the Earth Award.
India's efforts in solar energy and climate change have found a place in the world.
The country's security has got a new strength.
This year our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad, so now we have become affordable power in water, space and navel three.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by visiting the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
The first waterway of India started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
The country's longest rail-road pool bogbill bridge was dedicated to the nation before Sikkim and hundreds of airports in the country - Pakyong.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India won a large number of moons in Asian sports.
India has also performed well in the Para Asian Games.
However, if I keep talking about our collective efforts of every Indian, then our mindset will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this has been possible due to the untiring efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
I hope that this journey of progress and progress of India will continue even in 2019 and our country will be able to scale new heights more strongly.
My dear countrymen, in this December, we have killed some extraordinary countrymen.
Dr. Jayachandran was known for providing cheaper treatment to the poor.
People say that they were always ready to treat the patient.
He used to give a fare to the elderly patients coming for treatment.
I'm thebeterindia.
Those who inspire the society on com website have read about their many such works.
Similarly, on 25th December, the death of Sulagitti Narsamma of Karnataka was reported.
Sulagitti Narsamma was a helper in providing birth to pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
He was honored with Padmashree earlier this year.
There are many inspiring personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narasamma who dedicated their lives for the sake of all the people in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would also like to discuss the social efforts of the doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the past, some of our party workers have told me that some youths of the city have been imparting camps and treating the poor free of cost.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these docker friends associated with selfless service is truly praiseworthy.
Today, I am very proud to say that due to collective efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
Some people told me that a few days ago, in Madhya Pradesh, more than three lakh people joined the Safai Abhiyan.
We got to read about Jayachandran and whenever we get a chance, the thbeterindia.
I have been trying to know such inspiring things by going to the com.
I am glad that today there are several websites that are inspiring us with many stories that inspire people.
Like the PositiveIndia.
Com is working towards spreading positiveness in the society and making the society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who bring about change in the society.
It is easy to spread negativity but there are many good things happening around us in the society and it is happening with the collective efforts of all the 130 crore Indians.
It is important to sports in every society.
When sports are played, the minds of the observers also get filled with energy.
We are experiencing a lot of things in the name, identity and respect of the players.
But sometimes there are many things behind that which are sportspersons who have moved ahead of sports.
I want to talk about a daughter Hanaya Visar of Kashmir who has won the Golden Jubilee in Karatte Championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanaya studied hard work and related rituals and proved herself by observing it very well.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for a bright future.
Many greetings and blessings to Hannay.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussion in the media about a 16-year-old daughter's registration.
You must have read.
Rajini has won a gold medal in the Junior Women's Muktabaji competition.
When Rajini won the lunch, she went on a stole of milk and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajini put his moon in a cloth and put it in a bag.
You will be wondering, why did Rajni drink a glass of milk
He did this in honour of his father Jasmer Singh ji, he sells lassi on a stall of water.
Rajini said that her father has made a lot of sacrifice in bringing her here.
Jasmer Singh rose early in the morning and his brothers and sisters used to go to work before.
When Rajini expressed his desire to learn boxing before his father, the father encouraged him to get all possible assistance for this.
Rajini had to start his Mukkebaji studies with old age because at that time the economic condition of his family was not good.
Despite all such odds, Muktebaji did not lose the strength of the regime and continued to learn it.
He has also won a moon in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini.
I also congratulate his parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting and encouraging him.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter from Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian tourist in the world.
He used to run around 300 kms of cyclone per day for 15 days.
Can we not inspire us to know about this kind of achievement
Especially my young friends, when we hear about these incidents, we also get inspired to interfere with the problems.
If the resolution is capable and enthusiastic then the obstacles are automatically curtailed.
Problems can never be hampered.
If we listen to such examples then we also get a new inspiration every moment in our lives.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals full of enthusiasm and enthusiasm in January like Lohadi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Maghi Bihu, Maghi
During the period, Surya enters Makar Rasi.
After this day, the day begins to grow gradually and the cold crops begin to harvest.
Many greetings to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat has been accomplished by our festivals.
We can see how well our festivals are connected with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not regarded as different, but individuals and culture are the same.
Our relationship with nature is a good example, a lander based on festivals.
There is also a list of planets along with festivals.
This traditional landscape shows how old our relationship with natural and geographical incidents is.
Festivals and festivals are determined as per the moon and sunset based on the moon and sunset.
It depends on who the lander believes.
Festivals are also celebrated as per the status of the planets in many areas.
All these festivals are celebrated in accordance with the moon calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu - all these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the sun calendar.
In many of our festivals, the feeling of saving rivers and water is particularly harmful.
Chhath festival - rivers and ponds are connected with the sunrise.
Even on the Makar Sankranti, millions of people immerse themselves in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals also give us understanding of social values.
On the one hand, its natural significance, on the other hand, every festival is taught with great ease the inspiration to live with one another.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the year 2019 and wish you a lot of happiness in the coming festivals.
Share the testimonies taken on these festivals with everyone so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is something that we can be proud of in our culture and we can show respect to the entire world and one of them is Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
Even in films, we must have seen a lot about its magnificence and enormousness and it must be true that the form of Kumbh is so grand.
People from the country and the world come and join the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, the people of faith and faith emerge.
Millions of people from all over the country are connected at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has been flourished and destroyed by our great cultural heritage.
This time, the world famous Kumbh, which will be held in Prayagraj on January 15, perhaps you all are awaiting a lot of enthusiasm.
For the Kumbh Mela, the silos have already begun to reach the saints and martyrs.
Its global significance can also be estimated from the fact that last year UNESCO has mentioned the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intensive Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the princes of several countries witnessed the preparations of the Kumbh, at the same time the flags of nations were hoisted.
The Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj is expected to bring more than 150 people to the country.
With the divinity of Kumbh, India's grandeur will spread its color throughout the world.
This can be a great experience for the youth, especially for the youth.
I personally went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are going on with a lot of pressure.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited for the Kumbh.
I dedicated the Integrated Command Control Centre there and the devotees will get a lot of help in this.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in Kumbh.
If there is a sense of faith in the event, it will be a good message to the far flung areas.
This time every devotee will also be able to worship Akshayvad after a sacred bath at Sangam.
This akshayvad, a symbol of the faith of the people, was closed in the fort for hundreds of years, whose devotees could not visit.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for all.
I appeal to you that when you come to Kumbh, you must keep different aspects of the Kumbh on social media so that more and more people get inspired to go to Kumbh.
The Kumbh of Adhyatm becomes the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh will also become a Kumbh of nationalism.
This Kumbh of the devotees will also become the Mahakumbh of the world tourists.
This Kumbh of artistic literature also becomes the Mahakumbh of creative forces.
Poojay Bapu and South Africa have an unprecedented relationship.
It was South Africa, which became soft and charming.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood firm against Rangbhad.
He also established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, which led to peace and justice across the world.
2018 - Nelson Mandela is also being celebrated as the birth centenary year and is also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of a colorful conflict across the world and who was the inspiration of Mandela
He had got the courage and inspiration of being in jail so many years ago.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspiring for the entire world, but their ideals also encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the Statue of Unity is the world's highest statue, there was a meaningful discussion with the police personnel of the country.
What kind of steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen
I also announced the introduction of Sardar Patel Awards for National Unity which will be given to those who have contributed in any form to national unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that India's strength lies in diversity here.
Respecting Sardar Patel's spirit, we pay homage to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, on 13th January, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji is auspicious.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, his workplace was North India and he left his life in Nanded Maharashtra.
In Patna, Karmabhoomi in North India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India was blessed with blessings.
If he wants his lifetime, he gets a glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji gained the post of Guru at the young age of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight justice from the Sikh Gurus in Varanasi.
He was calm and simple personality, but when efforts were made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji strongly condemned his voice for the poor and the vulnerable, and hence he said: "Sava lakhs of soldiers are fighting a war, a video, a maiden named Baj Tudountbe Gobind Singh.
He said that strength cannot be displayed by fighting with the weaker sections.
Shri Gobind Singh ji knew that the greatest service is to remove human suffering.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice, religion, who had an intellectual knowledge of both arms and science.
He was not only a thriller but also a scholar of many languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
It means Food Safety and Standard Authorisation is happening through Off India.
Several programmes are being organized across the country on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
F in this chain.
Under the Eat Right India Campaign, healthy India journeys are coming out across the country.
The campaign will continue till January 2nd.
India will also be prosperous when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritious food is the most important for good health.
You should also participate in this and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
Important education of food is essential from childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, talk about mind again, be it the life of a person, be it the life of a nation or be it the life of a society, inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, let us move forward, let us change ourselves, change the country too. Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On October 3, 2014, the Pawan Parv of Vijayadashmi, through Mann Ki Baat, we all started a journey together.
Today, 50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat have been completed.
Similarly, today this Golden Jubilee Episode is the Golden Jubilee episode.
The letters and phones that you have received this time are mostly in the context of this 50th episode.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has asked about the same question as Manika Jain, Burdwan, the Government of West Bengal, and the musicians of Nagpur, on the App.
He says that many times people connect you with latest technologies, social media and mobile phones, but why did you choose radio to join people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today's era when the radio was forgotten, why did Modi come with a radio
I was going to some other place during the evening.
In the mountains of Himachal, if it gets cold in the evening then stay on a road for tea on a road and when I gave an order for tea then earlier it was a very small slope, one person himself used to make tea and sell it.
There was no cloth.
On the edge of the same rod, he was standing with a small larie.
He said, No, sir, you don't know what, it's a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand, he said, "Look at the Saheb Radio, there was talk about it on the radio.
Access and depth of communication, perhaps no one can do the right thing to the radio.
This thing has been done in my mind since that time and I had just realized its strength.
When I became the Prime Minister, it was very natural for me to pay attention to the most powerful medium.
And when I took charge as a Prime Minister in May 2014, I wanted that the unity of the country, our grand history, its valour, the diversity of India, the strength of our society, the strength of the people, the strength of the people, sacrifice and penance, all these things should be brought to the people of India.
From far flung villages to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young professionals...
At present, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these possibilities which are very interesting.
Out of those surveyed, an average of 70 per cent are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is that it has enhanced the spirit of positiveness in the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, Jan Andolan has got a big boost.
There has also been widespread discussions about indiapositive.
It is also a reflection of the spirit of positiveness and the spirit of positivity in the minds of our countrymen.
People have also experienced that Mann Ki Baat has increased the spirit of doing something with volunteering.
Narendra Modi is also joining Mann Ki Baat through Radio, Mobile, Internet, Facebook Live and Periscope.
I convey my heartfelt condolences to all the members of the Mann Ki Baat family for their belief and their participation.
Your expectations are correct.
If the leader gets a microscope and listens to the number of lakhs of crores then what should be done
Some young friends studied all the topics in Mann Ki Baat, analyzing the words of all episodes, laxical analysis, and he studied how many times the words were spoken.
What words have been spoken repeatedly.
One of his lights is that this programme has been unpopular.
When Mann Ki Baat was started then I had decided that there should be no politics in it, neither should there be any appreciation of the government nor should there be any Modi in it.
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain immortal, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore countrymen will always be alive.
This will take the country to new heights with inspiration and enthusiasm.
The strength of a government will be so much that the zeal of the selfiewithdaughter starts from a small village in Haryana and spreads not only across the country but also abroad.
Every section of the society, celebrities, all should be connected and in a new, modern language of thinking in the society, which todays generation understands.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat is also enjoyable, but I always have 130 crore countrymen.
His mind is in my heart.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government issue.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
India's original life is not political, India's original life is not political.
India's original life is social policy and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life, there is also a single aspect of politics.
It is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes the incidents and politicians of politics become so convinced that other talents and others of the society are buried.
Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort in this direction.
Your question is in a way a question of self-reliance.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking questions to the Prime Minister, as if you are asking questions to your friends.
The question you have asked is, if I answer it in a simple word then I will say nothing.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy job for me.
Every time Mann Ki Baat is the first letter of the people.
On May Gov and Narendra Modi Mobile App, people say their thoughts, there is also a toll free number - 1800 11800.
People also record their messages in their voices by calling them there.
As the episode of Mann Ki Baat approaches, I read the ideas and information sent by you during the tour.
And that is why when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with myself.
Later, I take note of certain factors like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
Indeed, there is a voice in Mann Ki Baat, but examples, emotions and emotions belong to my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to name in Mann Ki Baat till date, but they have been sending letters and letters without ceaselessness - your thoughts and feelings have a great significance in my life.
I am confident that I will get many more things from the beginning and will make Mann Ki Baat more accessible, more effective and useful.
It is also attempted that the letters which are not included in Mann Ki Baat will also be taken into account by the concerned departments regarding letters and instructions.
Mann Ki Baat reaches more and more people through their hard work.
Akashwani team prepares every episode for broadcasting in many languages.
Some people efficiently speak Mann Ki Baat in the sound of Modi in regional languages.
Thus, he becomes Narendra Modi for just 30 minutes.
I also congratulate those people for their talent and skills.
I would urge all of you to listen to this programme in your local languages as well.
I would like to heartily congratulate my friends of the media who regularly broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
Any political media is never happy, it feels that it gets very little coverage or the coverage available is negative, but the media has made several topics raised in Mann Ki Baat.
There are many topics like cleanliness, road safety, dragon free India, selfie with a doctor whom the media has worked to take forward in a new way.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat will remain incomplete without your cooperation.
Indeed, I don't have any books.
What I am doing will also happen in all the families.
In a simple language, I try to put myself in the youth, in that situation, I try to provide a balanced platform with the ideas of this thing.
It becomes easier to understand when we do not come in the middle of our lives.
The youth of today are very much aware that they will not do anything that they do not believe in themselves. And when they believe in something then they leave everything behind it.
Many times people discuss the communication gap between the elderly and the elderly in their families.
Indeed, the trend of interaction with swimmers in most families is very limited.
In most cases, there is a stoppage in terms of wealth or lifestyle, without any expectation, open mindset, gradually the family is getting very low and it is also a matter of concern.
Discussing instead of accepting and dismissing expect will make the dialogue effective.
My efforts are to continuously interact with the youth through different programmes or social media.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or what they are thinking.
They always have a store of Idea.
They are very powerful, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I try to further share the efforts of the youth and their thoughts.
Many times there is a complaint that youngsters ask a lot of questions.
I say that it is good that the youngsters have a question.
This is because it means that they want to examine all the things from the roots.
Some people say that there is no patience among the youth, but I believe that there is no time for the youth to wipe out the same thing that helps the youth to become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We feel that todays youngsters are very ambitious and think a lot of things.
It is good to see big dreams and achieve big achievements.
Fully, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do many things in a single time.
What is wrong with this
He is transformed into multitasking, so he does so.
If we look around then it is the youth who bring about a big change in the social interaction or start-ups, sports or any other field of society.
Those youngsters who showed the courage to ask questions and to dream big.
If we take the idea of the youth to the ground and give them an open environment to express them, they can bring about a positive change in the country and they are doing this.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vineeta ji has written on May i. e.
He said that this day is special because we are entering the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vineeta ji, thank you very much for your suggestions.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
The day of remembering the great scholars who made our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1947.
In order to fulfil this historic task of dissolving the Constitution, the Constituent Assembly started for 21 months and 1 days.
Imagine that within three years these great scholars gave us such a comprehensive and comprehensive dialogue.
The extraordinary speed at which he created the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
It inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country, each of them was committed to giving a Constitution to the country so that the people of India are empowered and the poorest of the poor can also be supported.
The special feature of our Constitution is that the rights and obligations i. e.
The combination of these two will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens.
If we respect the rights of others, then our rights will be protected. And if we follow our obligations given in the Constitution, then our rights will be protected.
I still remember that in 2010, when India's democracy had completed 60 years, we had taken out the beauty of the Constitution by keeping it on elephants in Gujarat.
It was a memorable occasion for youngsters to raise awareness about the Constitution and connect them with the passages of the Constitution.
We will complete 70 years as a nation in 2020 and will complete 5 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all take forward the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, one can never forget the contribution of the great personality who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana day.
I salute Babasaheb from all the countrymen who have given the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians.
He used to say that the democratic values of India have not come from outside.
What is the democracy and what is the parliamentary system, it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he made a very emotional appeal that we have to protect our blood from such a conflict.
He also used to say that we Indians may be of different backgrounds, but we have to keep the patriots on everything.
My dear countrymen, on 23rd November, two days ago, we all have celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we are going to celebrate his 550th birth anniversary in 2017.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of holy places connected with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was holding a meeting in this regard, I remembered Saheb Guru Nanak at that time.
During the 2001 earthquake of Gujarat, it was a great loss to Guru Gobind but the way the state government renovated it with the local people is still an example today.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit that holy place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan, Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, we will meet once again after 50 episodes, in the next Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today this programme of Mann Ki Baat has given me the opportunity to keep the sentiments behind you for the first time because you people have asked such questions but our journey will continue.
The more we connect with you, the more our journey will become more dense and will make everyone satisfactory.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of some people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I would like to say that one thing touches my mind about the possibilities of Mann Ki Baat. Most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat, we feel that the elders of our family are sitting among us and sharing our own thoughts with us.
When I heard this thing in a broad way, I was very sad that I am from you, and in a way, I will continue to join you again and again through Mann Ki Baat as your family members.
Your ambition, my ambition.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Thanks a lot.
Mann Ki Baat, October, 2018
About six and a half months before independence, on January 24, the world's famous International Magazine, the edition of Time Magazine published on the face of Sardar Patel.
He had published a map of India in his main store, and he was not such a map that we want today.
It was the map of India shared in many parts.
Time Magazine wrote that there were dangers like discrimination, violence, food crisis, inflation and politics of power on India.
Time Magazine further writes that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had the ability to serv the country in the light of unity among all these.
He gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha.
His authenticity and commitment to the country was such that all the farmers, from labour to entrepreneurship depended on them.
Whether it be Hyderabad, Travancore or Rajasthan, it was Sardar Patel, whom we can see today in a single Indian with a sense of humility and geographical skill.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on seeing this nation, our Mother India, which is enshrined in unity.
On 31st October, the Jayanti Order of Sardar Patel will be special. We will dedicate the Statue of Unity to Sardar Patel on this day.
The height of this statue established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is twice as high as the Statue of Liberty of America.
It is the world's highest skyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud of the fact that the world's highest statue is on the soil of India.
The land with which Sardar Patel was connected will also increase the beauty of the sky.
I also salute the families of our soldiers for their valour but do you know why we celebrate this country day
This is the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army had landed on the land of Kashmir and had protected the valley from the mischief.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview of Sam Manekshaw, who was a great army officer of India.
Fild Marshal Manekshaw was remembering the time when he was a Colonel.
During this period, a military campaign started in Kashmir in October 14.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had resigned for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir during a meeting and Sardar Patel looked at him in his special estimation during the meeting and said that there should be no delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and as soon as they are formed, the solution should be taken out.
After that, the soldiers of the army flew to the Kashmir Bhani aircraft and we saw how the army achieved success.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt.
He also paid respects to Netaji.
My dear countrymen, no one likes sports.
I had two memorable visits recently.
Earlier, the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta had the opportunity to meet our parameters.
In these sports, India won a total of 2 moons and made a new record and enhanced India's pride.
I got the privilege of meeting with all these talented parameters and I congratulated them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youth have performed the best ever in the Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we also got 13 moonlights and 3 other moonlights in mix events.
You must be recalled that Indias performance in Asian sports was also excellent this time.
See, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best and the most grand words so far.
This is the story of today's Indian sports, which is touching new heights on the day.
India is making new records not only in sports but also in those fields which never thought about.
For example, I would like to tell you about Paradisethelite Narayan Thakur who has won a gold medal in athletics for the country in the Asian Para Games 2018.
He is Divyang from his birth.
He lost his father when he was eight years old.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After quitting the orphanage, he worked as a waiter in Dhaba on the edge of roads in Delhi to clean DTC buses for driving a lifelong vehicle.
Today, Narayana has been winning the Golden Moon for India in international events.
Not only this, see the growing pair of excellence in Indias sports, India has never won any original medal in Judo, whether it is a synonymous deal or a junior deal.
But Tababi Devi created history by winning the medal in Judo in Youth Olympics.
16-year-old girl Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
His father is a labourer when his mother works for selling fish.
There have been several times in front of his family when he does not even have the money to eat.
In such circumstances, Tababi Devi's interest is not diminished.
He created history by winning a medal for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every youngster, his philosophy is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you must be reminded that we had successfully organised the Fifa Under 1 World Cup in 2017.
The entire world also appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
FIFA Under 1 World Cup also created a new record about the number of audiences.
Over 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and increased the participation of young players.
This year, India has had the privilege of organizing the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian who has a sportsperson or a sportsperson in any sports event must have an instrument of hockey in his mind.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has received golden moonlight in several competitions and has once been the winner of the World Cup.
India has also given hockey many great players.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
The entire world is familiar with Hockey's superior Major Dhyanchand.
After that, Hockey has spent a lot of money from Balvindar Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, the players of Team India are inspiring the new generation of hockey with the success they have achieved due to their hard work and hard work.
There is a good opportunity to see thrilling matches for sports lovers.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only encourage the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men's Hockey Team for this competition and assure them that 125 crore Indians stand with them and their support and convey my best wishes to all the teams of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming voluntary servants, they are inspiring for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, in the new era, in the new era, in the new era, in the new era, in the new era, in the new era, in the new era, today we are coming forward to do this thing with new zeal and new zeal.
Every Indian will feel proud of seeing the zeal and zeal for this work.
IT to Society, Main Nahin Hum, Aham Nahin Yame, Self-Self-Society travel has a smell in it.
Somebody is thinking about children and somebody is thinking about the elderly.
If someone is involved in cleanliness then someone is helping the farmers and there is no redness behind doing all that, but there is a selfless feeling of dedication and resolution.
A young man learned a television basketball for the help of Divyang's television basketball team.
This is a dedication to the nation. This is a missionary activity.
Wouldn't any Indian be proud of this
This spirit of 'Main Nahin Hum' will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was looking at your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I was seen from Puducherry to see a very interesting tip of Shri Manish Mahapatra.
He has written on MyGov - Please talk about how India's traditions and traditions are the best examples of co-existence with nature in Mann Ki Baat.
For sustainable development, how we need to adopt their traditions in our lives, we need to learn something from them.
I appreciate you for keeping this topic amongst the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a matter that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture, today the entire world is particularly discussing environment conservation and exploring new ways for balanced lifestyle- Balanced life.
However, our India is not even free from this problem, but we just have to do it in ourselves, we have to look at our rich history and traditions, and especially the lives of our tribal communities.
Staying in harmony with nature is being included in the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers as Goddesses.
The people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship the trees like peepals and Arjun in particular in the Bhilwara of Central India.
In a border like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us the path of environment protection.
They are particularly acceptable to leave their lives in terms of conservation of trees, but they are not allowed to lose a single tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with the tigers.
They consider them as their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the tiger is also seen as the protector of the forest.
The people of the Varanasi community in Maharashtra consider the tiger as guests and bring the richness of the tigers to them.
In Central India, there is a belief in the Coal community that their luck is linked to the tiger, if the tiger does not get food then the village will also be hungry - it is their reverence.
In the Mediterranean Movement season, the Catholic River stops fishing in some parts of the country.
He considers these areas as a refuge for fishing, which is why they get healthy and abundant quantity of food.
Tribal communities make their homes from natural materials, strong as well as environment friendly.
In the solitary areas of the Nilgiri Plateau of South India, a small populace, traditionally, their habitations are made of locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living with a very peaceful and mutual fair but when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were tribal people.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against the British rule for the protection of his wild land
There are many examples of the tribal community that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and that the country is the pride of our tribals for protecting the wealth of forests.
Let us express our gratitude towards them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about individuals and organisations who are doing extraordinary work for the society.
Such works which appear to be common in the first place but in reality they have a strong impact on changing their mindset and changing the direction of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Gurubachan Singh ji of Punjab.
A common and hardworking farmer was the daughter of Gurubachan Singh ji.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will marry simplicity.
Be it other things, there is no need to spend a lot of money.
Something that may be difficult for the family members of the daughter, but you will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a straightforward farmer, what he said by saying is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told him that you promise me that now you will not be able to save yourself.
You can imagine how big social power is there.
Gurubachan Singh ji is very fond of this thing but he tells us how vast his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform the individual event into the context of society.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh has made such an example before us.
I have read about Kallar Majra, another village in Punjab, which is near Nabha.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Majra and the people of all those places who make their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
All of you are taking forward the Indian heritage of healthy lifestyle as a true successor.
Just as the Tetetepe lake is built, the small awareness and activeness and positive work always play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our books:- , : : :
Please establish peace everywhere in the lives, in the hearts, in me, in the stars, in the world.
India has a special significance this year on 11th November as the end of the First World War 1000 years prior to today, is completing 100 years i. e.
The First World War for India was an important event.
In a true sense, we would not have taken any direct action against that war.
Yet our soldiers fought bravely and played a very important role and made the highest sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when it comes to war, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their valour in inaccessible areas and even in odd circumstances.
It was the only purpose behind all that was the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world saw the flag of destruction.
According to estimates, about 1 crore soldiers and nearly the same citizens lost their lives.
With this, the entire world understood the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today the meaning of peace and harmony is not just war.
From Transformation to Transformation, from economic development to social justice, we need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our Ishaan is a matter of concern.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unparalleled and the people there are very talented.
Our ISAN India is now known for all its best practices.
Ishaan Bharat is an area which has made great progress even in biological farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food processing.
You will be glad to know that this award given for the best policy formulation in this sector is equivalent to Oscars in the sector.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this thing that our Sikkim has left behind 51 elected policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is on completion.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on these festivals.
I would urge you to take care of yourself in these festivals, take care of your health and also take care of the interests of the society.
This festival will also become an opportunity for you to move forward as a mission and take a strong resolve.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The progress of your country will be as much progress as possible.
My best wishes to you all.
