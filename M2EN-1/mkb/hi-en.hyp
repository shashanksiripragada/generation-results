My dear countrymen, greetings
My best wishes to you all on Diwali
We have been told - Shubham Karoti Kalyan Health Wealth Wealth
How excellent is the message in this verse that light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which, by destroying the opposite intellect, shows goodwill.
My bow to such a divine light
To remember this Deepawali, better thought and what could be that we should expand light, spread positivity and pray to destroy the feeling of hostility.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world
The special thing is that it does not include just the Indian community, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens of that country, the social organizations of that place celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way , India stands there
Friends, The festival tourism has its own attraction in the world.
There are immense possibilities of festival tourism in our country, in the country of festivals.
We must strive to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
There are so many festivals of every state, every region of our country that people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country in increasing the festival tourism in India is also very important.
My dear countrymen, we had decided that we will do something different on this Diwali.
I had said, Let us all celebrate the women power and achievements of India on this Diwali, that is, respect for Laxmi of India
Immediately after this, there was a lot of inspiratory stories on social media.
Harangal's Kodipaka Ramesh wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power
My mother is God for me
Everything for me is India ' s Lakshmi in the right sense
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother
Geetika Swamy , who is active on Twitter , says that Major Khushboo Kanwar is Laxmi of India who is the daughter of a bus conductor and led the All-Commen detachment of Assam Rills .
For poetry Tiwari, India's Lakshmi, her daughter, who is also her strength
He's proud that his daughter paints the best
He's got a very good rank in the ATE exam.
At the same time, Megha Jainji has written that an elderly 92-year-old woman of Ninety Two Year gives free water to the passengers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Megha ji, this India has been greatly motivated by the humility and compassion of Lakshmi.
Many such stories have been shared by people
You must read, take inspiration and share something similar with yourself and bow down to all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous poet of the 17th century, Sanchi Honamma, he wrote a poem in the 17th century, in the Kannada language, in the language of Kannada.
It seems as if his Foundation was constructed in the 17th century.
How good words, how good expressions and how good ideas are in this poem of Kannada language
Pannida Parmegondanu Himawantnu, Pannida Bhrigu Parchidanupennida Janakarayanu Jasuvalendu (Penninda Permegondanu himavantanu. Penninda broohu perchidanuPenninda janakarayaanu jasuvalendu) i.e. Himavattaraja, due to her daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu got fame due to her daughter Lakshmi and Raja Janaka got fame due to her daughter Sita
Our daughters are our pride and the glory of these daughters is a strong identity and a bright future for our society.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak Devji ' s influence is not only in India but in the whole world .
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev ji
I can never forget my visits to the gurus in Vancouver and Tehran
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji that I can share with you, but there will be several episodes of Mann Ki Baat for this.
He always kept the service paramount
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the service done with selflessness cannot be done .
They stood firm against social evil like touching
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji conveyed his message in the world, far and wide
He was one of the most travellers in his time
They went to many places and wherever they went, they won their hearts, their simplicity, humility.
Guru Nanak Dev ji made many important religious visits, which are called sadness
With the message of goodwill and equality, he visited everywhere, north or south, east or west, with people, saints and sages.
It is believed that the famous Santa Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him .
He visited the holy land of Haridwar
There is a sacred place in Kashi, Gurubagh Gurudwara, it is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed there
He went to religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Guru Nanak Dev ji in the South visited Sri Lanka
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev Ji had solved the problem of water there.
In Bidar, there is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb which reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, it is dedicated to him.
During a sadness, Guru Nanak ji also visited Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the North.
It established a strong relationship between the Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev Ji also went to Tibet, where people, considered him, Guru
They are also worshipped in Uzbekistan, where they traveled.
During one of his sadness, he also visited Islamic countries on a large scale, including Saudi Arabia, India.
Just a few days ago, Ambassador of High Live Countries from around 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and all this happened under the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji .
All these Ambassadors not only visited the Golden Temple but also had the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Subsequently, many Ambassadors shared photographs on the Social Media with great pride and good experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the date of October 31st.
Sardar Patel used to watch and examine things in a very depth manner.
In fact, they were Man of Detail
At the same time he was skilled in organization skills
He was mastered in planning and formulating strategies
When they read about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, they can see how powerful their planning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country were going to attend the congressional convention in Nineteen New Delhi.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements for the session
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city
He approached the farmers and urged them to make khadi bags
Farmers make bags and sell to delegates
Putting shoes in these bags, keeping them with you ended the tension of shoes stolen from the delegates' mind.
On the other hand khadi sales also increased considerably .
Our country, Sardar Patel will always be grateful for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly
He did an important task of ensuring fundamental rights, thereby avoiding any discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did a great and historic task of uniting the princely states.
Actually, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in some special provinces in the integration of the country.
He also played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947 our neighbour was on Lakshadweep and sent the ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel got this information, he lost time without delay, without delay, immediately started harsh action.
And the tricolor was hoisted therein after their command , and they destroyed every neighbour of the land of Lakshadweep .
After this incident Sardar Patel asked Mudaliar Brothers to personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist destination .
I hope you will all travel to its beautiful islands and beaches
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the highest statue in the world .
Statue of Liberty in the United States is double in height
The tallest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride
Every Indian ' s head rises higher than pride
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that on an average, eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of Statue of Unity every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's faith in his heart, his reverence, his reverence and his reverence for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now the centres of such attraction are continuously developing and the local economy is also getting a boost and people are getting new employment opportunities.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming here, many villages are providing homes and common style facilities.
Professional training is also being provided to people providing Come Stay Facilities.
The people there have started cultivation of ragon ruit and I am sure they will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there .
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We all testify how a place within a year develops as a world famous tourism destination.
There people come from abroad
There are several systems of transportation, locomotives, guides, eco-friendly arrangements.
Very big economy is developing and people are creating facilities as per the requirement of passengers.
Government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, the National Integration Day is celebrated on 31st October every year from 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting our country at all costs of unity, integrity and security.
On 31st October, every time Run for Unity is being organized.
It will include people from every section of the society, every section
Run for Unity is a symbol of this, this country is one in one direction and wants to achieve a goal.
One goal - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat
The last five years have been observed - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the States, in the district centres, in small tier-to-tier-three cities, there are men, women, people of the city, people of the village, children, youth, elderly people, everyone is joining in large numbers.
Anyway, nowadays, see, people are getting a hobby and passion about marathon.

This portal provides information about places across the country where Run for Unity is to be organized.
I hope all of you will run on 31st October - for the unity of India, for the fitness of yourself.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel binds the country in the form of unity
This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every juncture, at every juncture, at every juncture.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual harmony, but sometimes it happens that the efforts of the society, its contribution, the memory panel becomes easier.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court passed its verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi.
Enterest Groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way
What kind of language was spoken to create warmth in the atmosphere
But all these things continued for five days, seven days, ten days, but as the decision came, the country felt a joyous, surprising change.
On the one hand, everything had happened for two weeks, but when the decision came on the Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all the communities, saints and saints gave a very balanced and restrained statement.
Whenever I remember that day , the mind is happy .
The dignity of the judiciary was very gloriously respected and there was no warmth anywhere, the atmosphere of tension.
These things should always be remembered , it gives us a lot of strength
That day, that moment, a duty for all of us
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the country.
I pay my tribute to them today .
My dear countrymen, today, if a story of every household is narrated far away, a story of every village is narrated - from north to south, from east to west, from every corner of India, a story is narrated by cleanliness.
But there is also a pleasant experience and interesting experience
I heard, I think, I'll tell you, too
You imagine, the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature goes minus 50-60 degrees minus
Coygen is also the only name in the air
In such adverse circumstances, living among such challenges is not less than any valour.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country by sewing sewage but also running clean Siachen campaigns there.
I appreciate him on behalf of the countrymen for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army
thank you
There ' s so cold that it ' s hard to get any decompose
In such a situation, separation and management of garbage is a very important task in itself.
In such a situation, removing 130 tonnes of waste from the glacier and its surrounding areas and this is also a great service between the ragile eco-system here.
We all know that Siachen is such a glacier that is a source of rivers and clean water, so the cleanliness drive here means to ensure clean water for those who live in lower areas.
Also use rivers like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that awakens new consciousness in our lives.
And in Diwali, especially buying something new, bringing something from the market is in less quantity in every family.
I once said that we should try - - buy local things
If we meet our village then there is no need to go to Tehsil .
If found in Tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
The more we try to buy our local products, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I urge you to keep our weavers hand-made with our Khadi people, we must buy something or the other.
Even in this Diwali, you must have purchased a lot before Diwali but many people think that if they go after Diwali then perhaps they will get a little cheaper.
there will be a lot of people who will still be bought .
So along with Deepawali's good wishes, I would urge you to come and buy local things.
See, how important we can play in the dream of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again, I convey my best wishes to you on this holy festival of Deepawali.
In Diwali we use a variety of crackers
But, sometimes there is a fire in the inconvenience
Somewhere injury occurs
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fanfare .
My best wishes
Thanks a lot
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Will he have control over his own life and destiny
Remember that Jantar of revered Bapu
Can we , while buying , think that what I am buying will benefit my country ' s citizens
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan
Best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious festival
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is considered to be a symbol of love and belief between sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many stories in the history of the country in which a defense formula had linked people associated with two different states or religions to the door of faith.
Just a few days later the festival of Janmashtami is also going to come .
The entire atmosphere is elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalals, govindas and govindas.
The natural joy of swinging in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Raksha Bandhan , Sanskrit day is also celebrated on the day of Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in tolerating, riding and bringing this great heritage to the common man.
Every language has its own importance, India is proud of the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and we all are proud of the fact that Sanskrit language has played a very big role in the propagation of knowledge from the Vedas to the present.
The knowledge of every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technologies, agriculture or health, astronomers or architecture, mathematics, economics or environment, the mantra of dealing with the challenges of global warming is mentioned in detail in our Vedas.
You all will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which the creation of infinite words is possible
Sometimes they use lion-shayari, but those who are familiar with Sanskrit greetings know that in very few words, such an accurate statement is made from Sanskrit greetings and on the other hand it is very easy to understand because of our land and our traditions.
As has been asked to explain the importance of the guru in life - one letter, guru: disciple Prabodhyet
We all celebrate the coming Teachers' Day with this feeling
The whole country celebrates Jayanti as Teachers Day .
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day. I also congratulate you for your dedication to science, education and students.
The scorching heat provides relief to the dry reservoirs, but sometimes it also brings excessive and devastating floods
There is a situation of nature that in some places it has rained more than other places .
The severe floods in Kerala have badly affected the lives of the people
Today, under these difficult circumstances, the whole country stands with Kerala
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their lives, cannot be compensated for the loss of life, but I want to assure the bereaved families that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
My prayer is that those who have been injured in this natural calamity will be healthy as soon as possible.
I am convinced that Kerala will be resurrected by the recompense and indomitable courage of the people of the State .
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something at their own level so that wherever there is objection, whether it is Kerala or the other districts of India or the region, the lives of the people can become normal again.
All age groups and people associated with every field of work are contributing
Everyone is engaged in ensuring that the trouble of the people of Kerala can be done at least.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala
They left no stone unturned to save people trapped in the flood
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of the NRC ' s bosses
He has done a very good job in this hour of crisis .
Efforts to meet the situation by making their commitment and quick decisions have become a new centre of reverence for every Indian.
Yesterday was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam gives strength to the country, particularly to Kerala, so that they can recover from this disaster as soon as possible and the development journey of Kerala gets faster.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and other parts of the country where the disaster has occurred, that the entire country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to mind
The topic on which the people from all over the country wrote is the subject, the beloved of all of us, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerji from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, how many innumerable people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov urging me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life
On August 16, as soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise, everyone was drowned in mourning
A nation leader who quit the Prime Minister's post 14 years ago
In a way , for 10 years , he had gone far away from active politics .
They were not seen anywhere in the news, they were not seen publicly
Over the past several days, the best aspect of Atal ji has come to the country.
People remember him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister and do
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act
This change made two important changes in India's politics
First, the size of the Cabinet in the states was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-party law was increased from one-third to two-thirds
Besides, clear guidelines were also set for disqualification of party changers.
For many years, the political culture of constituting a huge cabinet in India was created not only for the distribution of big jambo cabinet but also for the pleasure of politicians.
Atal ji changed it
His move saved money and resources
At the same time there was an increase in efficiency
It was a long vision like Atal ji who changed the situation and flourished healthy traditions in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure there was a change in the time of presenting the budget .
Earlier , according to the tradition of the British , the budget was presented at 5 o'clock in the evening because at that time there was a time for Parliament to start in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 a.m.
Many such rules have been made in this code, which made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
That is why more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their flag
Thus they brought Our beloved Tricolor near to the people .
Likewise, nowadays you are seeing that the discussion about the elections of the Center and the States together in the country is going on.
People in both the sides of this subject and the opposition are talking about themselves
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy
I must say that for a healthy democracy, developing good traditions for the best democracy, striving hard to strengthen democracy, pushing forward discussions with the open mind, this will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay tribute to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Just a few days back the monsoon session of Parliament has ended
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and Rajya Sabha is 74.
Above all the MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and consequently the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and 14 bills .
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of youth
Several important bills that benefit youth and backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades, there was a demand for creating a BCommission just like the SST Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution to create a BCC this time and gave it a constitutional right.
This will prove to be a step forward for the purpose of social justice .
Amendment Bill to safeguard the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed in this session
This law will further preserve the interests of SC and ST community
At the same time, it will prevent criminals from torturing and trust in Dalit communities
No civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice against the women power of the country .
The guilty of rape are not ready to tolerate the country, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made the provision of harsh punishment
The culprits of misbehavior will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls under the age of 12.
A few days ago , you must have read in the newspapers . In Mandsaur , Madhya Pradesh , a court has sentenced two convicts of rape to death after just two months of hearing .
Earlier a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh sentenced the culprits to death after just five days of hearing .
Rajasthan has also made similar quick decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crime cases against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
However , this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible . I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands firmly to bring them justice .
When we proceed in the countryside, life of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived can be changed.
This time in the monsoon session everyone has presented an ideal .
These days crores of people are focused on Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning people first look at the newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won the medal.
Asian Games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country
My best wishes to those players whose competitions are yet to be held.
India's players, especially in Shooting and Restalling, are performing excellently, but our players are also bringing medals in sports that have not been so good before, such as sports like ushu and rowing - these are not medals only - proofs of the skyrocketing fun and dreams of Indian sports and players
Increasing number of medal winners for the country are our daughters and this is a very positive sign - even our 15-16 year olds are among the medal winners.
It is also a very good indication that most of the players who have won medals are from small towns and villages and they have earned this success with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all the sports lovers and also pay my tributes to the great sportsperson of Hockey Shri Dhyanchand Ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness because healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players good performance.
Greetings to everyone on National Sports Day
Hello, I respect your spirit.
All of us have seen the building of houses and buildings with brick and stones but can you imagine that about twelve-two years ago a huge mountain that was just a single stone mountain was given the form of an excellent, vast and amazing temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but it was that temple - Kailashnath temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra
If someone tells you that a 60 meter long pillar of granite was built about a thousand years ago and a 80 tonne granite rock on its summit was placed - will you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible mail of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan of Gujarat .
Land Engineering Laboratory of India
There were many engineers in India who made the imaginable and presented examples of miracles in the world of engineering.
We also got a gem in our legacy of great engineers whose work is still astounding to the people and he was Dr. M.
In that part of the country it is worthy of worship and the rest of the country also remembers them with great respect and intimacy.
In their memory , September 15 is made as an engineers Day .
Following their footprints, our country's engineers have made their marks in the whole world.
When I talk about the miracles of the world of engineering, I miss a terrible earthquake in Kutch in Gujrat in 2001.
I used to work there as a volunteer then I got an opportunity to go to a village and I got an opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age and she was mocking at me and she was saying, Look, this is my house in Kutch.
But you didn ' t see any damage anywhere
This house was built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature of this place and it was saying so proudly, so I thought that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period did what they had done in accordance with the local conditions due to which the common man was safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Should workshops at location location
Which new things have we to learn in the changed age
World is battling natural calamities
In such a situation what is the new form of structural engineering
What are his course
What to teach students
How do ero waste make this our priority
When many such things celebrate Engineers Day, we must think.
There is an atmosphere of festivals and with this preparations for Diwali also start .
We will continue to talk about our minds, we will continue to talk about our minds and we will continue to pursue the country with our minds.
My best wishes to you all with this spirit.
Thank you
will meet again
There are reports of good rainfall in many places these days .
There is also news of anxiety due to excessive rainfall and in some places people are still waiting for rain .
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rain shows the form of preference and dislike, but what do we blame rain, man is the one who chose the path of struggle with nature and the result of that is that sometimes nature rushes to us
And that is why we all have the responsibility to be lovers of nature , to be guardians of nature , and to be the promoters of nature , so that there is a balance between whatsoever is given to nature .
Just like in the past, the incident of a natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world, shaken the human mind
You must have seen the team of 12 teenage football players in Thailand and their coach went to the cave.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But , on that day , the fate was different .
And when they went into the cave , abundant water accumulated near the gate of the cave , due to heavy rains .
You can imagine how the moment will be when death appears in adolescence and you have to spend moments
On the one hand, he was battling the crisis, on the other hand, humanity was united in the world and Goddess manifested human qualities.
People all over the world were praying to get these children out safely .
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, their families, the media, the citizens of the country, everyone has shown a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in his mission as a team.
In this entire operation, a young Thai Navy soldier also lost his life.
The whole world is amazed that he did not give up his hope with such bravery and patience in a dark cave full of water despite such difficult circumstances .
It shows that when humanity comes together, wonderful things happen
We just need to focus on our goal with a calm and stable mind, keep working for it.
In the past, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us
Neeraj ji had a special feature - hope, trust, determination, self-confidence
However , the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
because this is the time when the call season of the colleges
Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to colleges
If we go to Feb and March Feams, Papers, Hanswers, then in April and May holidays, the results, the directions ahead in life, the carrier choice is spent in this.
July is the month when the youngsters keep their feet in the new phase of their life when they move away from the focus sessions to the cut-o.
The attention of the students goes from home to hostel
Students come in the shadow of prossors from the shadow of parents
I am sure my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, going out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a protective environment has to become a chariot.
For the first time so many youngsters leave their homes and come out to give a new direction to their lives
Many students must have joined their colleges so far, some will be joining.
I would like to tell you people that be calm, enjoy life, enjoy the inner life.
There is no choice without books, studio has to be done, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own value
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, making and maintaining new friends, it is a very wise job in itself.
Learn something new, like new skills, new languages
Youngsters who have left their homes and have left their homes and have gone to some other place to discover those places, know about them, people of that place, language, culture, tourist destinations of that place.
My best wishes to all the youngsters starting a new innings
His father raises garbage and raises his family
I congratulate them for their success .
There are many students from a poor family , and with their hard work and perseverance , they have done something that inspires us all .
Ahmedabad's Bitia is Afreen Sheikh, whose father runs auto Rickshaw, the daughter of Nagpur is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick-slaughter
Ramesh himself used to sell toys at the fair or Anushka Panda, the divyang daughter of Gurgaon, who is suffering from a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy since birth, all of them have achieved such success by crossing every obstacle and enthusiasm.
If we look around us , we ' re going to get a lot of examples
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to recite the sky to the earth. I have to call every darkness in light, I have to cover the sword with the smell of flowers, and to awaken the mountains of Gaga. My dear countrymen, a few days ago my eyes went on a news and wrote - Two youth did the dream of Modi
The incident was that once I was discussing with Indian youth in San Jose City, which is known as Technology Hub.
I had appealed to them to think about how they can use their talent for India and do something by taking time out.
I had appealed to convert Brain-rain into Brain-Gain
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together have prepared a SmartGaon App using their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile .
Residents of this village of Rae Bareli, villagers, district magistrates, all people made people aware about the use of this app.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will be noticed that the youth of the United States is living in the midst of the lives, thoughts and ideas of that place. He must have left India several years ago but still he knows the nuances of his village, understands the challenges and is emotionally connected with the village.
For this reason, he might have made something in line with what the village needs.
It is natural for every Indian to have a sense of connectivity with their villages, their roots and doing something for the country.
But sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to ecological conditions, a slight ash gets accumulated on it, but if a small spark is touched then all the things emerge again and they take it to their past days.
We should also examine our case . It has not happened in our case , the circumstances , the distances have not separated us , the ashes have not been frozen .
Santosh ji thank you very much for your phone all.
In reality Pandharpur Vari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadi Ekadashi, which was on July 23 this time, is also celebrated as a grand culmination of Pandharpur Vari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15 - 20 days before Ashadi Ekadashi the pilgrimage of Warkari i . . pilgrims come out on foot for the journey of Pandharpur with palanquins .
This journey, which is called Vari, includes millions of Warkari
The great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram walk towards Pandharpur, singing Vitthal-Vitthal by placing them in the palanquin.
Pilgrimage travellers reach there for sightseeing of Lord Vithal , also called Vithova or Pandurang .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense reverence, devotion
Going to the Vithova Temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty, spiritual joy has its own different experience.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Wari once I get an opportunity .
Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - countless saints are still educating the masses in Maharashtra
They are giving strength to fight against superstition and this saint tradition has been inspiring in every corner of India .
Whether it is their burden or disillusionment, we get important messages of harmony, love and brotherhood from them.
The mantra of fighting society with reverence against superstition is found
These were those who prevented society from time to time, showed mirror and ensured that the old evil practices should be eliminated from our society and people should have rituals of compassion, equality and purity.
Our Indo-Bhumi Bahuratna Vasundhara, as a great tradition of saints lived in our country, in the same way the great men dedicated to the powerful Mother India, sacrificed their lives to this land.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression in the minds of many Indians .
We remember Tilak jis birth anniversary on July 23 and his death anniversary on August 01.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence .
They had the power and wisdom to show the British rulers the mirror of their mistakes .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to sedition them three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing
I want to put an interesting event in front of the countrymen today, associated with a statue of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad about a hundred years ago and during this visit Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 01, 1920, he had decided that he would build his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality and immediately he chose Dictoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and this Dictoria Garden was named after the ueen of Britain .
Finally, the statue was completed and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not only to anyone but to Mahatma Gandhi on February 28, 1929. And it is a matter of great joy. In that inaugural function, Pujya Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only got one person but he has also got the courage to build the statue of Tilak ji.
And my dear countrymen, the uniqueness of this statue is that it is a rare idol of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, in which it is written right below Tilak, Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of the British.
With the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji , the tradition of public Ganesh festival started .
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium to promote traditional reverence and festivals as well as social awareness, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people.
At the same time it was a period when it was necessary that the country should be united to fight against the British, these festivals broke the barriers of caste and creed and united everyone.
Over time, the popularity of these events increased
This shows that our ancient legacy and our brave heroes of history are still crazy in our youth.
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh-Pandal in almost every street .
This is also a great opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like leadership and organisation, they can develop within themselves.
I had requested the last time too and once again when I remember Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival this time too, celebrate it with pomp, celebrate it with joy but urge you to celebrate Eco-friendly Ganesh festival.
From the idol of Ganesh ji to the decorated goods, everything is eco-friendly. And I would like every city to have different competitions for eco-friendly Ganesh festival, rewards for them. And I would like to commemorate MyGov and on Narendra Modi App, things of eco-friendly Ganesh-Utsav should be kept for extensive publicity.
I will surely convey your word to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self-confidence among the people of the country . He gave a slogan Swaraj is our birthright and we shall live with it .
Today it is time to say Swaraj is our birthright and we shall take it .
Every Indian should have access to good governance and development results
I ' m talking about Chandrasekhar Azad
What will be the youth in India who will not be inspired by listening to these lines Sarfaroshi's desire is now in our hearts, see how strong it is in Baju-e-Katil these lines inspired many youngsters like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad
Chandrasekhar Azad's bravery and passion for freedom, inspired many youth
Azad put his life on claim, but he never bowed in front of foreign rule
It was my good fortune that I had the privilege of going to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh .
Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also got the opportunity to pay homage and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was a brave man who did not want to die with the bullets of foreigners - whoever lives would fight for freedom and die even then he will die as a freedom fighter. This was his specialty.
Once again I salute the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has made history by winning the gold medal in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, emailed me to Indonesia in response to my letter. They are preparing for Asian Games.
-Mail writes unity: The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he catches the tricolor and I am proud that I have done that.
Unity is also proud of you all
You have illuminated the country ' s name
Unity has won Gold and Bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grandpri 2018 in Tunisia
His achievement is special because he made his challenge a means of success .
Daughter Ekta in 2003, due to road accident, half of her body failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and achieved this position while strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji, he has created a world record by winning a gold medal in the discus throu in Para Athletics Grand Pri in Berlin, along with Sunder Singh Gurjar has also won gold medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, several events in the history of August are full of festivals, but sometimes the disease enters the house due to the weather.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for this month of August and for the various festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Then verily , they shall meet for a word of the mind .
greeting
My dear countrymen, once again this programme of Mann Ki Baat has got the privilege of being accompanied by you all.
Just a few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have realized that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan ' s first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India
Both the teams performed well in this match and another baller from Afghanistan, Rashid Khan, this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan , Mr . Ashraf Ghani , tagged me on his 120th twitter . The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan .
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have given our players a platform to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
He is an asset to the world of cricket and at the same time he has not written in a bit of fun, we are not going to give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable one for all of us
Well this was the first match , so it ' s very natural to remember , but I ' ll remember this match for a particular reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What can a winner team do while taking the trophy
- While taking the trophy, the Indian team of Afghanistan, which was playing international match for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and both the teams took photographs together.
What is sportsman spirit, what is sportsmanship - we can experience with this one incident
Sports is an unprecedented way of uniting society and discovering the talent of our youth.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June had a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world came together
Be it the European Parliament in Bresil, the headquarters of the United Nations at New York, the Japanese navy fighter ships, people were seen doing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic program of Yoga and I have been told that many postures were demonstrated by women.
India and China soldiers simultaneously practice together on the high snowy peaks of Ladakh
Yoga works to break, connect all boundaries
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this occasion a big festival by going beyond all kinds of discrimination, caste, religion, region, color or gender
If people from all over the world were so enthusiastic and participating in Yoga Day programmes then why would it not be multiplied in India
Our warriors of the Air Force , however , shocked everyone by doing Yoga at an altitude of 15 , 000 feet above the earth in the middle of the sky .
The sight was that they swim in the air and not in the air
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or fields of sports, Yoga has happened everywhere.
Yoga has worked beyond caste, creed and geography to unite people all over the world. The spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam has been won for centuries.
Our sages, sages, saints, who always insist on, Yoga has proved it in the true sense.
more and more people will make it a part of their lives
On MyGov and NarendraModiApp, many people have written to me that I should talk about the Octobers Day on 1st July in this regard - the right thing
We are those who naturally worship the mother as God, believe in God as mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, so many times the doctor regenerates us.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today, the doctor does not have medical expertise, but he has a deep experience about the general life style trends and what impact he has on our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark all over the world with their capabilities and skills
In medical profession, along with hardworking, our doctors are known for solving complex medical products.
We are fortunate people who are born in this land of India
India has a rich history when there is no such month, there is no such day in which there is no historic event.
Look, everywhere in India has its own legacy
There is a saint associated with it, a great man, a famous person, everyone has their own contribution, its own greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and anyway when I was in Gujarat, you are well aware of the Kabirwad of Gujarat.
When I used to work there, I had also organized a large, national session of people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You know, why did Kabirdas ji go to Maghar
At that time there was an impression that the one who died in Maghar does not go to heaven.
On the contrary, the body that leaves in Kashi goes to heaven
Magahar was considered infectious , but Sant Kabirdas did not believe it .
Thus did they break the evils and the superstitions of their times , and so they forgot , and they took the samadhi .
Sant Kabirdas ji stresses on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his stanzas and dualities
These were their ideals
This is what we see in his writings , and in today ' s era they are equally inspiring .
It is He who knows and understands the agony of others who do not know the misery of others .
Kabirdas ji stressed on social harmony .
They thought far ahead of their time .
Put it in yourself, do all kindness
In another doha, Kabir writes - where there is mercy tahan religion, where greed and sin
He said: - Do not ask the caste sadhu, ask the knowledge
Such is the greatness of the guru and one such guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed the glory of the people, have been inspiring for centuries
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
wherever he went , he took several initiatives for the betterment of society .
The system of kitchen free from social discrimination, where every caste, creed, religion or community person could eat food, Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to join this with enthusiasm and excitement
I urge you people to think about the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, how to celebrate it in the entire society and around the world, new ideas, new suggestions, new ideas, new imaginations, make preparations and make it an inspiration for all of us along with great pride.
My dear countrymen
India's freedom struggle is very long, very wide, deep, full of countless martyrdom.
There is another history associated with Punjab
In 2019, the terrible event of Jallianwala Bagh has been 100 years since it was shameful to humanity .
We can all think about it, but remember the immortal message given by this incident. This violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Raman Kumar of Rohini of Delhi has written on Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's birthday is and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was very good to see your interest in India ' s history .
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people would know that Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed Convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengali on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937
This was the first time that the British ruled and someone at the University of Kolkata addressed the convocation in Bengali.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries Minister of India and in a sense he had laid a strong foundation for Indias industrial development, had prepared a strong base, had prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was to be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field
He wanted India to develop large industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handloom, textiles and cottage industries.
He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal.
The result of their understanding, discretion and activism is that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still part of India
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India - and for this he also lost his life at the age of 52.
Let us always remember the message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, live together for Indias progress.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
He got the opportunity to know directly about the changes in the lives of people by going beyond the files.
People talked about their resolutions, their happiness and their achievements
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me but it was a different kind of learning experience and what could be the moment of satisfaction for anyone's life than the happiness that was seen on people's face during this period
When he heard the stories of a common man, his narrative of his experience was touched by his heart.
In far-flung villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to passports in villages through common service centre.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and does business by making his ice-cream
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of youngsters of the country are running medicinal centers as well as providing affordable medicines in nearby villages.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two or three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business.
Not only this, ten-fifteen people are also giving more jobs
Students from schools of Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working at their young age on competition topics like waste management in the school's tinkering lab.
Do not know how many stories there was no corner of the country where people do not have to talk about their success
In such an environment, when a common man comes with new hope, new zeal and incidents in his life, he is not credited with the government.
The incident of a small girl from far flung villages also becomes an inspiration for hundreds of millions of people .
With the help of technology, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant, very motivated and it gives me satisfaction to work but it also gives me the enthusiasm to do more.
Another new joy of living for the poorest of the poor, another new zeal, another new inspiration.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge program and gave me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you
I always feel, if we look around us, something or the other is good.
Good people .
We can also experience the aroma of goodness
In the past one thing came to my notice and this is a very unique combination .
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand, our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming and farming.
They came together to build a simple prosperity trust and have activated this trust for doubling the income of farmers.
Connecting the farmers, making plans and making successful efforts to increase farmers income
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the right of farmers to participate in the profits.
Separate seed-bank has been created for crops, good breed seeds for them.
Women see the functioning of this seed-bank women have also been added
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am glad that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technocrats, engineering have taken the path of connecting with the farmers of the country, connecting with the villages, connecting with the fields and Khalihan.
Once again I convey my best wishes to the young generation of my country for their innovative experiments, for their innovative experiments.
GST is going to be completed one year. The dream of the people of the nation One Nation, One Tax has changed today.
If I want to give credit to the highest number of people for this thing then I will give credit to the states.
GST is a great example of cooperative federalism where all the states together took a decision in the country and after that such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can all be proud that people of different political ideology sit there, people from different states sit there, they are different priorities but despite this, all the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been made unanimously.
Before GST, there used to be 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a celebration of honesty
In the first country , there were complaints of Inspector Raj in the case of tax .
Everything from return to reund is done through online information technology.
With the introduction of GST, the check post was abolished and the movement of goods became faster, which has not only saved time but also benefitted in the logistics sector.
GST may be the world ' s largest tax reform
Such a big tax reform was achieved in India because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST could be ensured only through the manpower.
It is generally believed that such a large country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to stabilize it completely. But the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country and the celebration of the honesty of the country is a result of the participation of the people that within a year this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and it keeps on improving its inbuilt system as per the requirement.
Through Mann Ki Baat, once again you have got the opportunity to be amongst you.
You will remember very well that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea journey for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - I want to talk about them
These 6 daughters of India, their team, had spent more than 250 days through sea.
NSC has returned to India on May 21 after traveling all over the world in Tarini and the whole country welcomed him very warmly.
He travelled in various oceans and many seas and traveled about twenty thousand nautical miles
This was the first incident in the world itself
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters, listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate these daughters for their adventure, for enhancing the prestige of Navy, for enhancing India's dignity and especially for the world that the daughters of India are not less.
Who does not know the sense of adventure
If we see the development journey of mankind then progress has been made in the womb of some adventure.
Development is born in the lap of adventure.
Intent to do something, to do away with some leaks, to do some extra ordinary things, I can do something.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam, a group of our tribal children climbed the highest peak in the world.
These Ashram-School students started training in August 2017 Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - their training took place
These youths were selected under Mission Shaurya and they have honoured the entire country by defeating the verest in accordance with the name.
I congratulate the people of the school in Chandrapur, these young friends and my heart.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to win the verest from Nepal
Many congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya became the first Indian father-son to climb the verest
Not only that young people are climbing the verest
Sangeeta Bahl climbed the verest on 19th May and Sangeeta Bahl is more than 50 years old
This work is not only commendable but also reflects their commitment towards cleanliness and environment.
Over the years, people have been climbing the verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these brave heroes, especially the daughters of my heart.
So a large number of people from every area will come forward in its support
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more the country will play.
On social media, people are sharing the videos of Fitness Challenge, they are tagging each other and challenging them.
In the matter of mind, many times you have heard from me about the games, about the players, and the last time our heroes of the Commonwealth Games, their minds were talking to us through this program - Namaskar Sir
Image Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the games that were once a street, a part of every child's life are becoming less today.
These games were specially part of summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that at different places they were known by different names, like now Pitthu is known by many names.
No one knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, seven stones, Dikori, Satodia
Traditional games have both kinds of games
There are outdoor, there are also indoor
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known by different names, different names.
I am from Gujarat. I know there is a game in Gujarat, called Chomal-Isto.
These are played with codies or imli seeds or dices and 88 square boards
This game was played in almost every state
We used to play these games .
Who will be of us, who has not played Gilli-Danda in his childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game played in villages to cities
In different parts of the country it is known by different names .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibari , then in Maharashtra it is called Financial .
Some games have their own season
You must have seen many children who are embarrassed but are very cheerful when playing
From children to grandparents, grandparents and grandchildren, when they play all these things, they don't call generation gaps, they also get tortured.
At the same time, we also know our culture and traditions.
Many games also make us aware about society, environment etc.
Through cross sourcing we can create a huge archive of our traditional sports
Videos of these games can be created, in which rules of sports can be shown about how to play.
India will officially host World Environment Day on June 5
It is a very important achievement for India and it is also indicative of India ' s growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change .
This time theme is Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, understanding the importance of this theme, let us all ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website weed-india 2018 and all the suggestions there are very interestingly given - see, learn and try to bring them into your everyday life.
In the last few weeks, we all saw that there was dust in different parts of the country, there was heavy rainfall along with strong winds, which is unseasonal.
There was also loss, goods and losses
We have to live in harmony with nature, stay connected with nature
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this every step throughout his life
When India played a key role in the Op21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, all of them had a sense of fulfilling that dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what can we do to make our planet clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You remember now on June 21, not only you, we are not only the whole world remembers on June 21.
21st June is observed as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people begin preparations months ago
These days, news is being received, preparations are being made to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21 all over the world.
Centuries ago it means that on doing regular yoga practice some good qualities become like relatives and friends .
Yoga leads to courage that always protects us like a father .
Forgiveness arises as mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, mercy, our sister, self-control, our brother, our own bed and knowledge becomes our hunger destroyer.
When so many qualities become a companion , the Yogi triumphs over all kinds of fear .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May the death anniversary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji, the first Prime Minister of India
I salute Panditji
The memory of this month is also linked to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857 when the Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers stood up against injustice showing their bravery.
Sadly , for a very long time , we used to call the events of 1857 merely rebellion or soldier rebellion .
Indeed , the incident was not only reduced but also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the month when the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkarji ' s personality was full of characteristics .
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji is done by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji .
How exactly did Atal ji depict
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together
Besides being a sensitive poet he was also a bold revolutionary .
I was watching a story on T.V. of our poor daughters of the raw settlements of Sikar in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who were forced to take garbage from their homes to their homes, are learning the work of sewing and dressing their clothes to cover the poor.
The daughters here are sewing from normal to good clothes apart from their own and their family clothes today
They are also coursing skill development
Our daughters have become self-reliant today, living their lives with respect and have become a force for their families.
I wish these daughters, full of hope and confidence, their bright future.
They have shown that if you are determined to do something then success can be achieved in all the difficulties and this is not just Sikar but in every corner of India you will get to see all this .
If you look at yourself, you will come to mind how people overcome problems.
You must have felt that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some of the people.
These discussions are political, social, films, sports and sportspersons too, the problems of the country and the problems of this kind of problem should be solved. But often these things are limited to discussions only but some people are those who move forward in the direction of bringing about changes in their works, their hard work and passion.
D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack city of Orissa, has a similar story of his dreams and consumption of himself to fulfill others' dreams.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to meet D. Prakash Rao.
Shri D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades
They provide education, health and food to all children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and for giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have abolished the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
Let ' s pursue positiveness
In the month of June there is so much heat that people wait for rain and look at the clouds in the sky in this hope .
A few days from now people will also wait for the moon
The appearance of the moon means that the Eid can be celebrated .
After a month ' s fast during Ramadan , the festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of celebration .
I am confident that everyone will celebrate Eid with full zeal. Children will get specially good Edie on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of goodwill in our society .
Best wishes to all
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
Then once again next month we ' re going to talk about the mind .
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
V.
Link to It India, lead it India and I am glad that people are joining it with great enthusiasm. Many people have written to me showing their support for this, sending letters, their fitness mantra on social media, it is India stories. A gentleman Mr. Shashikant Bhonsle has shared a picture of the swimming pool - My weapon is my body, my element is water, My Lord is swimming.
Ruma Devnath writes, "With Morning walk, I feel myself happy and healthy and she further says - for me itness comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy."
Make these holidays an opportunity for a new experience, my dear countrymen
When we hear that there will be wars of water in the world in the future , everyone speaks of it , but is there any responsibility for us
Do we not think that water conservation should be social responsibility
That is, it is the responsibility of the person who has knowledge that I do not know the Bengali language, but when I was young I was used to get up very early - since childhood and in eastern India radio starts early, if it starts late in western India then in the morning I have an idea.
Rabindra Music started at 30 o'clock, I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Music by rising early in the morning and listening to Rabindra Music on the radio. And when Anandlok and Aguner, Poroshmoni were listening to these poems, the mind got a lot of consciousness, you also got Rabindra Music, his poems must have influenced him. I bow down to Rabindranath Tagore and my dear countrymen
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We must be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people all over the world. This Buddha Purnima reminds Lord Buddha of his efforts to follow the path of Lord Buddha and reminds us of his obligation to walk and walk on his path. Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Ambedkar insists that Lord Buddha has been inspired by his social philosophy. He had said that my social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavmi
My best wishes to the countrymen on this sacred festival of Ram Navami
What was the power of Ram in Bapu ' s life , we have seen him every moment in his life .
On 26th January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were present here, they had come with them with a ultra-troop and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting Ramayana to us.
I.e. Ram and Ramayana are creating as much inspiration and influence in the ASEAN countries not only in India but also in this part of the world.
I once again extend my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, like every time I have received all your letters, emails, phone calls and comments in large quantities.
Soft Thakkar ji on MyGov - I read what you wrote about starting Sanskrit on-line courses.
Besides being a IT professional, it was very good to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to bring you information about the efforts being made on this side
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit, I will also request them to consider how to carry forward the suggestion of Somal ji.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Baraker, District Nalanda, Bihar read comments on your NarendraModiApp

Sakal ji, I have delivered your feelings to all the listeners
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that this time I talk to the youth about their health.
They think that our young people are physically Week if they compare the Asian Countries
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time we should talk to everyone about health in detail.
In the past, the President of France visited Kashi. Shriman Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that journey were touching the mind, they were going to create an impact.
And, he had urged that all those photographs should be promoted on all video, social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had shared those photos on social media and Narendra ModiApp on the same day.
Angah, Jayesh, I want to tell you all the children that these letters of yours are tired of my day.
I have read all these letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I have heard and many of these things have touched my mind. Even if I talk about them, perhaps I will have to say something continuously for months.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about eam
Holidays have shared their plan,
Worried about the water of animals and animals in the summer
Farmer brothers and sisters have received letters about the activities being undertaken across the country regarding farmers-friendly and farming.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions on water conservation.
Our festivals, our cultures, our traditions come up in the festival season.
That is, things of mind change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the weather changes in the lives of somebody.
And why not change
It is indeed the whole country to change the weather .
13 years ago, due to lack of timely treatment, the sister of Kolkata's ab-driver Saidul Laskar died - decided to build a hospital so that no poor person dies due to lack of treatment.
Sadul sold home jewelery in his mission, collected money through donations.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of funds, Saddul Laskar's efforts brought color and today due to his hard work, due to his resolve, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country
Today, in every section of the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, the belief is that yes.
We can move forward, our country can move forward
There is a positive atmosphere of confidence filled with hope and hope.
This self-confidence, this positivity will fulfill our resolve of a New India, it will prove to be a dream.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for farmers brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji all considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and common man's life.
This expression reflects in his line when he had said - To orget how to dig the earth and tend to tend the soil, is to forget ourselves. If we forget to take care of the soil, then it is like forgetting ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji often stressed on the need for conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of mass awareness for our farmers to ensure better income, better irrigation facilities and enhance food and milk production.
This low - area state has done a great job
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record production over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goal is set, the courage is high and there is a resolve in the mind, then it can be proved and shown.
In the letters I have received, I was seeing that a lot of farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to give farmers the right price for crops.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local mandis of the village, the Holsele Market and the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go far to sell their produce - for this 22 thousand rural haats of the country will be integrated with APM and e-NAM platform while upgrading with the necessary infrastructure.
In a way, such a system is being constructed with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year, the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi will begin.
How did the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is our resolve, apart from this, how can we pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by joining the shoulders of 1. 25 billion countrymen
I urge you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
What is slogan or mantra or Ghosh
Give your suggestions about this .
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and inspire him to bring our country to new heights.
Tell us something on how we are mobilising institutions. Thank you, you have rightly said and I believe that both Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has gone beyond conventional approach in the field of health.
At the same time, all the departments and ministries, be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, be it Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or be it the State Governments are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on affordable health along with the preventive health.
Preventive health care is the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we are aware of the preventive health care, the more the person, the family and the society will benefit.
Life is the first need to be healthy - sanitation
As a preventive healthcare, Yoga has created a new identity in the world.
Yoga guarantees both fitness and wellness
This is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement today, has reached home.
The International Day of Yoga is less than 100 days left between June 21 .
On the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the country and around the world participated in it with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and motivate the entire family, friends, all, for Yoga.
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
I will share this video with all of you so that we can practice asana and pranayama together.
Efforts are also being made at a comprehensive level to ensure health care and affordable, affordable and accessible to the common man.
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being made available at low prices.
More new centers are being opened
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to inform the needy about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras - their expenses will be reduced.
They will have a great service
The cost of heart stent for cardiovascular patients has been reduced to 85
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families, or around 50 crore citizens, will be provided with a cost of Rs. 5 lakh per year, Government of India and IIC.
The number of MBBS seats in the current 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts
The target of making the country TB free by 2025
That ' s a big job .
You need help in awakening to the masses
To get rid of TB we all have to make collective efforts .
My dear countrymen, 14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had spoken of industrialization of India.
The industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the world's largest foreign direct investment in the world.
The whole world is looking at India as an investment innovation and BCD for development
The development of industries would be possible only in cities due to which Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar relied on urbanization and urbanization of India.
Keeping this vision further, smart cities missions and urban missions have been started in the country so that all kinds of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country - be it good roads, water facilities, health facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance
They did not want anyone to live in poverty forever .
At the same time , they believed that nothing could be removed from the distribution of the poor .
India, Stand up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
In the 1930s and 1940s, when there was talk of roads and railways only in India, Baba Saheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways.
These were Dr. Baba Saheb who saw water power as a nation power
Historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country today
New ports are being built on different seashores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 40s, most of the discussions took place on the 2nd World War, the Emerging World War and the Partition - at that time Dr.
Placed the foundation of India's spirit
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working together with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and cooperative cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance. And most importantly, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me associated with the backward classes.
They have shown us that in order to move forward, it is not necessary to be born in a big or rich family, but those who are born in poor families in India can see their dreams, strive to fulfill those dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people ridiculed Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
India belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor and the backward.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized from 14th April to 5th May to mark the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar
Under this, there will be separate programs on village development, poor-employment and social justice across India.
I urge all of you to take part in this campaign
My dear countrymen, several festivals are going to come in the next few days, Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance .
The life of Lord Mahavir Ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire us all
Best wishes to all the countrymen Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the discussion of the Easter comes, the inspirational preachings of the Lord Jesus Christ are remembered who have always given the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion to humanity.
In April , the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India , at the same time , twins and satvine in Bihar , Bihu in Assam and Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will be joyful and joyous .
Through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts received in the form of yield.
Once again, greetings to all of you for the coming festivals.
Today initially the talk of mind starts with a phone call
We have seen that the sea ' s colour is blue , but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no colour of water .
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, the water becomes colorful
The same question came in the mind of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India .
When we talk of science then the name of India-Ratna Sir C. V.
One of their hosts is known as Raman Deect .
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year because it is said that on this day he had hosted the event of light scattering for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, on the other hand, Sushruta and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, Hamous Particle Boson was also named.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smart by self learning
Can we help the farmers with crop production
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat for the inauguration of the ICFREE in Ahmedabad.
Science and Technology are value neutral
They don't have values, themselves
Any machine will do the same thing we want .
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dison , who invented Wight Bulb , failed many times in his experiments
Once he was asked about this, he replied, I have found ten thousand ways of not making the High Bulb, that is, Dison has made his failures his strength.
Incidentally, today I am in the Auroville of Maharshi Arabic.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
Find out the answer and show the way to humanity
The spirit of asking questions repeatedly to know the truth, is important
This is the real inspiration behind the scientific dinner .
You should not sit comfortably until you get answers to questions like why, what and how
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, At the time of Crisis, safety and disaster keep coming to me a lot of messages on these subjects, people keep writing to me something or the other.
Shriman Rabindra Singh from Pune speaks on Coccupational Safety in his comment on NarendraModi Mobile App
He has written that safety standards are not as good at factories and construction sites in our country.
If India has a National Safety Day on 4th March, then the Prime Minister should talk about safety in his Mann Ki Baat program so that awareness about safety increases among the people.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life and are unable to achieve it then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster.
All of us read a board on the paths, it says that the vigilance has come to an end, the loss should be forgotten, the joys and smiles should not leave the world so soon, the relationship with security should not be linked to security.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can only protect our lives, but we can save our society from great accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that many formulas have been written about safety on work place but when we see it, it is not visible anywhere.
As far as disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many natural and man-made disasters such as chemical and industrial accidents
Disaster Mitra has also been initiated for training of volunteers in floods and cyclone-affected districts.
Training and awareness have a very important role
Two-three years ago, thousands of people used to lose their lives every year from the Lu Heat Wave.
After this, NMA organized workshops to manage the heat wave, launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
A good result came from everyone's participation
Number of deaths due to Lu in 2017 decreased unexpectedly to around 220
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get security
I would like to appreciate all those who are engaged in relief and rescue operations within minutes wherever there is a calamity.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscience society
In our culture, we often talk about values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of safety.
We have to make it a part of our life .
I mean , what was the arrangement for information
Why
Because we are not conscienceally and therefore we listen to our ears after sitting on a plane but none of us feels that this information is for me.
We have the same experience in every sphere of life
We should not think that safety is for someone else, if we all become aware of our safety, then the spirit of safety of the society is also implicated.
My dear countrymen, this time the budget was emphasized on making waste to wealth and waste to energy through biogas for villages under Swachh Bharat.
The initiative was initiated and it was named GBAR-Chan - Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-Chan scheme is to make the villages clean and convert solid waste materials of animal dung and farms into MPST and BI-GAS and generate wealth and energy from them.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other organic waste to produce energy but its full potential was not being used in India .
We are now moving forward in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural
The goal of using cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, all these to make biogas based energy has been set.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not just as waste but as source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-reliance in terms of energy for cooking and lighting
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing income
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
A online trading platform will also be created for the smooth management of the Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers can get the right price of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self help groups and cooperative societies.
I invite you to become partners of this movement of clean energy and green jobs in your village to change waste to wealth and make dung to dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been listening to a variety of festivals like music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But in a unique effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state's first garbage festival was organized.
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about the cleanliness of the city's waste and create awareness about various ways to re-use the garbage.
During this festival, a variety of activities took place, from students to adults, everyone joined.
Different kinds of artworks were made using waste .
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of Waste Management
Inspired by Raipur , there were different types of garbage festivals in other districts also .
Innovative ideas, shares, discussions, poems were read about cleanliness while taking initiatives on their own.
A festive atmosphere was created about cleanliness
Especially the way school children took part in it, it was amazing
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and sanitation was displayed in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March
There are many programs in the country and the world
On this day, women are also honored with the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country who have done exemplary work in different areas in the past.
On this occasion I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda
He had said that the idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence - this idea of Swamiji represents the contemplation of women power in Indian culture a hundred years ago.
It is the duty of all of us to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life today.
We are part of that tradition where men were identified with women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-son, this was the identity of a son.
Indeed , they have forwarded themselves , and have made the nation and the society move forward , and have taken a new decision .
In the past , a very good suggestion was given to me by a gentleman .
He had suggested that on 8th March there are programmes like celebrating Women's Day in every village-city which have completed 100 years
Can a program of respect of such mothers and sisters be organised and can a long life be talked about in it
Starting from 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water bodies, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big is the event
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will effectively transform the cleanliness drive in normal life into the nature of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and how much joy and enthusiasm is there among the people there.
You all know well, Elephanta island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai
I was surprised to know that despite being so big a tourist destination in Mumbai, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years since independence.
For 70 years, the dark shadow of the lives of the people of Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senth Bandar, three villages of Elephanta Island, is now dark and their lives are illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am glad that the caves of Elephanta village and Elephanta will now be lighted by electricity .
This is not just electricity, but it's a new beginning of development.
What could be the moment of satisfaction and happiness that the lives of the countrymen should be illuminated, happiness in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now, the month of March, the fields decorated with flammable crops, the golden earrings of stagnant wheat and the splendor of mango that triggers the mind - this is the specialty of this month.
But this month is also very dear to all of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2 the whole country will celebrate Holi with joy
The importance of Holi is as important as Holika combustion as it is the day of burning and destroying evils in the fire .
Holi is auspicious opportunity to forget all the differences, to participate in each other's happiness and happiness and love gives a message of unity and brotherhood
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of the festival of Holi.
This festival is full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - this is the best wishes
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, today I have written a long letter to Shri Prakash Tripathi on NarendraModiApp and urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written, Kalpana Chawla's virtue date to go to the space on February 1.
He left us in the Columbia Interview Accident but inspired millions of young people around the world .
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has initiated his long letter from the departure of Kalpana Chawla .
It is a matter of sadness for all that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age but she conveyed her life to the entire world, especially to the thousands of girls of India, that there is no limit to women power.
There is nothing impossible if there is desire and determination, if there is a need to do something.
It is heartening to see that today women in India are progressing rapidly in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place in society and their contribution has surprised the whole world.
There has been a long tradition of Indian scientists .
India has contributed a lot to fabricate the moons of Vedas
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi do not know how many names
It shows the importance of women in our society
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of power
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family in the form of unity
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given several further examples
He has written that our bold defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft will fly in Sukhoi 30, inspire him
Three brave women are emotional Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi Highter Pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30
All Women Rue, led by Capacity Vajpayee, from Delhi to USA, San Francisco and from Delhi to Air India.
Flying in India Boeing Jet - and all women
Honble President of India has taken a new initiative in the past
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, met a group of extraordinary women who did something first in their respective fields.
The first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, the first woman to reach Everest, thus breaking the traditions of society, our women and women achieved unusual achievements by breaking the traditions of society.
He showed that a new path can be prepared by crossing all obstacles and barriers on the strength of hard work, passion and determination.
A book on these women achievers, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire country can learn about these women powers, take inspiration from their lives and their works.
It is also available as e-book on NarendraModi website
Today, the women power of the country plays an important role in the positive change in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you must be wondering what is the connection between this.
Mumbai ' s Matunga station is the first station in India where all women employees are
In all the departments, women stake - be it commercial department, railway police, ticket checking, Announcing, Point Person, more than 40 women have a status.
This time, after watching the Republic Day parade, many people wrote on Twitter and on the other social media that there was a key point in the parade, the BSF Biker Contingent in which all women were participating.
He was using courageously and this scene was also surprised by the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance
Today our women power is leading
becoming self-reliant
When tribal women come to mind, a definite picture emerges in everyone's mind, in which there are jungles, footpaths, the burden of wood on them is laid on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
In such dangerous areas, tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running a rickshaw.
In a very short period , many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration here, from providing grants to training, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leave what is out of time, accept the correction of what is necessary
Any lifestyle is identified by the self-ordering mechanism.
Over the centuries against social evils and evils , there have been constant efforts at individual and social levels in our country .
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
In order to eradicate social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers has been created.
This campaign made people aware of evils like child marriage and dowry practice
The entire state resolved to fight with evils like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters, everyone was involved in this war.
Patnas historic Gandhi Maidan begins with unbreakable connectivity to the borders of the State
It is important that our society is free from these evils so that all the people of the society get the right benefit of development .
Let us collectively pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and a New India.
Make India a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration of the region and every person involved in the human chain that he has taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines in the month of his father was Rs. 6,000 per month.
He was not aware of the first Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 75 percent.
He has expressed his desire to talk about it in a programme of mind so that more and more people can know about it and take advantage of it .
For the past few years, many people keep writing to me about this subject.
gets a deep satisfaction
And I also felt very happy that Shriman Darshan ji had come to know that whatever he had received was also received by others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make Health Care affordable and encourage Case of Living.
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 90 from the branded drugs sold in the market
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines every day.
The generic medicines purchased are according to the standard of World Health Organization .
That ' s why good quality medicines are available at cheap prices .
More than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country today
This is not only providing cheap medicines but also providing new employment opportunities for the individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available on nectar stores of Indian Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Hospitals
The only purpose behind all this is to provide quality and affordable health services to the poorest of the poor so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created .
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has done a Photo, Share on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That Photo was such that my attention was drawn to that Photo.
The photo was such that a grandson was taking part in the Clean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river Morana flows for the first twelve months but now it's seasonal.
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, hydroelectric
There was a lot of garbage being thrown on the river and its banks .
A action plan was prepared and on 13th January, a day before Makar Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Lean Morna, two edges of river Morna were cleaned at fourteen locations in the area of four kilometers.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, colleges, students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this noble task of Mission Lean Morna.
The Swachhta-Abhiyan was continued in the same way on January 20, 2018 and I have been told that this campaign will run every Saturday morning unless the river Morana is completely cleaned.
It shows that nothing is impossible if one decides to do something .
Massive changes can be brought about through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and municipal administration for making this work a mass movement and I congratulate all the citizens and your efforts and this effort will also inspire others of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about Padma awards these days.
Even in the newspapers, the attention is drawn on T.
There has been a tradition of awarding Padma every year but its entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can nominate anybody
Transparency has come when the whole process is online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been fully transformed.
Padma awards have been given to such people who are not usually seen in big cities, newspapers, TV functions.
Now the significance of his work is increasing, not the identity of the person to give the award
You must have heard Mr. Arvind Gupta ji, you will be happy to know about it.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life in making toys for children.
They have been making waste toys for four decades to increase the curiosity of science in children .
They are trying to inspire children from useless things to scientific experiments, so they go to three thousand schools across the country and inspire children by showing films in 18 languages.
What a wonderful life, how amazing dedication
Similar story of Karnataka's Sitawa Jodatti (SIC).
They have not been said to be the goddess of women-powerment
For the last three decades in Belagavi he has contributed greatly to changing the lives of countless women .
He had dedicated himself as Devadasi at the age of seven but then spent his entire life for the welfare of the devadasis .
Not only this, he has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
He used to do normal jobs for living but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings
Today, due to this hobby, they are respected not only in India but in the whole world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji , who illuminated Indias name abroad , was recognized and given Padma Shri award .
You will be happy to hear the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in tribal areas between dense forests.
He created five hundred herbal medicines on the basis of his memory
He has mastered making medicines to be used after snake bite .
Lakshmiji is constantly serving the society with her knowledge of herbal medicines
He was awarded Padmashree for his contribution to society by identifying this anonymous personality .
Today, I want to mention another name, 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry from West Bengal was also selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in others' homes to build a hospital
When she was 23, her husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired her to make a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in their hard work hospital.
I am confident that there are many such males in our polygamy, there are many women and women whom no one knows, no one recognizes.
The Padma Puraskar is a medium but I will also tell the countrymen that those who live around us for the society, those who eat for the society, those who work for the sake of the society, those who work for the sake of some or the other, those who work for the entire life should sometimes bring them in the middle of the society.
They do not work for honor but because of their work we get inspiration
Sometimes in schools and colleges such people should call and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there should be some effort in the society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is 9th January, when the lord Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from STARICA.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we had organized a programme where all MPs and Mayors of Indian-Mool living around the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in that programme from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tania, Kenya, Canada, Britan, Suriname, South Africa and America, wherever our mayor is there, wherever the original Indian, wherever MPs are originally-Indian, all of them participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries as well as maintaining their strong relations with India. This time, the European Union, the European Union has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions to various fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe in a very good way.
Someone is dedicated to Ayurveda, somebody immerses the minds of the society with his music, somebody from his poems.
Someone is doing research on climate change and somebody is working on Indian texts. Someone has set up a gurudwara by running a truck.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for recognising the people of Indian origin and providing information to people around the world through them.
On 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu who has shown us a new path
On that day we celebrate the martyrdom day, we pay tributes at 11 o'clock to the great martyrs who lost their lives in the defense of the country.
The path of peace and non-violence, this is the path of Bapu
Whether it is India or the world, whether it is a family or a society or a society, the ideals that Bapu has given us are still extremely relevant.
They were not just core theories
At present, we also look at Dagar-Dagar how well Bapu's words were
If we resolve to walk on the path of Bapu, lets go, then what can be a great deal of devotion
My dear countrymen, while congratulating you all on the auspicious occasion of 2018, I salute my speech.
Where the youth from 18 to 25 years of age should churn on a New India, find ways and plans
How can we prove our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India dreamt of by our freedom fighters
B.
a.
I talked to them, there was no despair of despair - there was enthusiasm, energy, dreams, resolutions, inspiration from those daughters, I also got inspiration and these are the strengths of the country. These are my youngsters, this is the future of my country. My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk of the world's famous religious places then it is very natural to talk about Kerala's Sabarimala temple, it is very natural that millions of devotees come here every year to take the blessings of Lord Ayyyappa Swami.
And especially in that place, which is located between hills and forests, how can this problem be converted into rituals, how can we find a way to recover from the problem and what is so strong in public participation - this is an example of Sabarimala Temple in itself.
Who will make such rules
There is hardly any citizen of India who does not respect him, does not respect him.
At that age we are greater than all of us, and are witnesses to different stages, different rounds of the country.
She is getting 90 years old on September 28
Before leaving for a foreign trip, I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone.
This conversation was the same, as in a very difficult way, the younger brother speaks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I thought I would like to congratulate Hilata ji: Hamodi ji: I wish you very good luck for birthday, congratulations
Lata ji: There are a lot of people older than the age, but the blessings of those who grow up from their work are very big.
Lata ji: ji, I think that my parents have blessings, and the blessings of those who listen
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is your humility for all of us, this is a great education for all of us. It is an inspiration for us that you have always given priority to the values and humility of your parents even after laying all this in your life.
Lata ji:
Modi ji: And whenever I come to you ji: Modi ji: You have fed me some or the other Gujarati
Lata ji: You don't know yourself what you are
I know that your coming is changing the picture of India and that is why I am very happy.
Looks pretty good
Modi ji: Just sister, keep your blessings, keep your blessings on the whole country, and you have always inspired me to do something good like us.
I also get your letter and I get some of your presentations, so I have a special pleasure in the adoption of one family relationship.
Lata ji: ji, ji
No, I don't want to give you too much trouble, because, I'm seeing, I know how busy you are and how much work you do
What do you have to think
When you visited your mother to touch her feet, I had sent someone to them and took their blessings.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And she blessed me on the telephone, so I liked it, Modi ji: Our mother was very happy because of your love.
And once again I offer you my best wishes on birthday
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, I used to think that I would come to Rubru: ji, ji
Lata ji: Jee ur, ur, ur
This is my good fortune .
Modi ji: Pranam, Didi
Lata ji: Pranam
Modi ji: Best wishes to you: Very greetings
Modi ji: Pranam ji
Further for several weeks, across the country, festivals will be thrilling
All of you, all the best wishes of the coming festivals
In festivals, all family members will come together
Perhaps, this proverb is not just words, we have an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Just imagine, on the one hand, some houses glitter with light, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, there is a dark shadow in the houses of some people around.
In some houses, sweets are getting worse, so in some houses, children, sweets,
The real pleasure of these festivals is only when it is dark, this darkness is less - light spread
We share happiness, where there is lack, and this is our nature too.
In our homes, in our sweets, clothes, gits, when there is a delivery in, think about a moment, delivery out.
At least we need delivery out of such things in our households, which are in excess, which we do not work now.
In many cities, start-ups of many NGOs young partners do these work.
They collect clothes, sweets, food, everything from the houses of the people, search for the needy, carry them and do an anonymous activity.
Can this time eradicate the darkness under this lamp with full awareness and determination in this season of festivals
The smile on the faces of many poor families, on festivals, your joy will double, your face will shine, you will be given, and you will be lighted, your Diwali will become illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, in the form of good fortune and prosperity, Laxmi's household arrives.
In our culture, daughters have been considered Lakshmi, because daughter brings good fortune and prosperity.
Can we do this program of honor of this Laxmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters around us, many of them who are doing extraordinary work.
Someone will be doing the job of teaching the poor children, someone will be involved in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health. Someone will be serving the society by becoming an engineer.
Will try to get justice by becoming a lawyer
Our society should identify and respect such daughters, and proud of them.
Their respect programmes are in the country
You can do one more thing about the achievements of these daughters, share maximum in social media, and use (ashtag) Bharatkilami (Lakshmi of India)
Just as we all had launched a grand campaign, Selie with Daughter and he had spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, we run the campaign Laxmi of India
Promotion of Laxmi of India means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen
My dear countrymen, I had said this thing beforehand that it is a great advantage that I get the privilege of communicating directly with many well-known people.
In the past, a student from far-flung Arunachal has sent a very interesting letter to Alina Tyang.
And it says, I read the letter before you. Hon'ble Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tyang.
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when the result of my exam came, some people asked me what did you read the Fam Warriors book
I said, I haven't read this book
But, go back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
Then my experience was very good .
I thought, if I had read this book before exam, I would have had a lot of benefit.
I liked many aspects from this book very well, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing the letter.
Dam Warriors to read 2-3 times, thank you
What you have said that if I get out at the time of new education then I will definitely try to write some things for the parents and teachers.
I urge all the students of the country, teachers and parents to share their experiences and suggestions on the aspects related to stress freeze.
I must study it .
I will think about it and I will try to write whatever I feel right from it in my own words, in my own way, and maybe if your suggestions come more then my new education will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tyang.
My dear countrymen, you also know about the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers, through TV, and also discuss the engagement.
But, you know, I am a common man like you.
If there was someone else on this occasion, he would have been sad and disappointed, but his face did not mean, but he smiled at everyone's faces with his words.
In their humility, simplicity and trace sentiment, everyone got convinced that the form of sportsman spirit was found in letter and spirit.
Their talk was welcomed by the present audience
Even after losing in a tough fight , he praised his rival Nadal and gave the living evidence of the sportsman spirit .
However, on the other hand Champion Nadal also fervently applauded Daniel's game.
The zeal of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner was worth seeing .
Our ancestors ' thinking is really capable
Mani Kanchan Sanyog: Janayati Loksya Lochan Anandamani, when the qualifications and humility in a person are incorporated together, then whose heart cannot win
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people around the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I am doing whatever I am going to talk directly for your good.
It ' s very difficult to stop it afterwards .
But, if we wake up early and stop it, a lot can be saved
With this feeling, I feel, today, especially with my youngsters, I must talk about something.
We all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful for health, and it becomes very difficult to abandon its addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases a lot to those who consume tobacco.
Everyone says
Tobacco intoxication is caused by the nicotine present in it .
Its consumption in adolescence also affects the development of the brain .
But, today, I want to talk to you, about a new topic
You will know that recently e-cigarette has been banned in India.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic appliance different from the normal cigarette.
While we all understand the dangers of common cigarettes, a misconception about e-cigarette has been created.
There is no danger to e-cigarettes.
This is their endeavor, that no family member should smoke or smoke.
They know that smoking, tobacco causes heavy damage to the body
He knows the drinker and He knows the seeing .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different.
There is not so much awareness in people about e-cigarettes.
They are completely unaware of its danger and this is why sometimes the e-cigarette enters the house quietly in the crown.
Our youth walks on the path of waste unknowingly
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarette, which has a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it from the smell
In such a situation, many adolescents and youngsters are roaming around in their offices, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes in their hands with great pride in the form of knowledge and sometimes as a condition statement and they become victims of it.
The younger generation is the future of the country
e-cigarette has been banned so that this new method of intoxication does not destroy our young country.
Do not trample the dreams of every family, the lives of children will not be wasted
These diseases, these habits do not accumulate in the society
I urge you all to leave tobacco and do not make any misunderstandings regarding e-cigarettes.
Let us all together build a healthy India
I want you to get it.
Remember India , right
India means that if we go to gym for two-two hours in the morning and evening, then it will happen.
This is our Mother India, this is our country, this is our multi-purpose Vasundhara.
Many human gems have come out of this land
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been a workplace
And these are the people who have spent themselves, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great Vibhuti is being honored at Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will declare Mary Thresia as a saint on October 13
The work done by Sister Maryam Thresia for the betterment of humanity in the short life of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
From the field of social service and education, he had a wonderful attachment
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and lived in this mission,
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world. Today, when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, 130 crore countrymen have taken a pledge to be free from single-seated plastic.
In the direction of environmental protection, seeing the kind of lead that India has taken in the entire world, today the eyes of all the countries are towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be going to be part of the campaign to get rid of single se plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way
However, a young man from our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
When I noticed his work, I tried to understand his new experiment by talking to him on the phone.
Maybe these things worked for other people of the country.
Mr. Rippudman Belvi ji is doing a unique endeavour, they plogging
When I heard the word plogging for the first time , it was new for me too .
In foreign countries , perhaps this word has been used in some quantities .
However, in India, Ripudman Belvi ji has propagated this very much.
Let ' s talk to them
I congratulate you all and my friends, this time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also organising an Fit India programme.
On 2nd October, these programmes will be organized across the country.
We have heard from the experience of Ripudman ji what happens in the programme.
We will not only take care of our health , but will also protect the health of the mothers of the earth .
This campaign is creating awareness among people about cleanliness along with fitness.
I am confident that 130 crore countrymen will take one step in this direction and India will move forward 130 crore steps towards the freedom of single use plastic.
Ripudman ji, once again, thank you very much
And I congratulate you, your team and this new imagination.
want to move forward to transform your life into a nationwide
One thing advance wants to remember a little bit
Well, I will call him in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I am saying in advancing so that you can get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
So you start preparations right now .
In detail, I'll talk further but now it's time, some people can start practice, some can plan.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had asked the Red Fort to visit 15 places in India by 2022.
Make at least 15 places and even one night, two nights stopping programs
You see, understand, experience India
How many varieties we have
And when they come to the festival of Diwali on the day of holidays, people definitely go away and therefore I will urge you to visit any such 15 places in India.
Today our rank is forty-four and five years ago our rank was at number 65 i.e. in a way we have put a huge jump.
If we try more then by the 75th year of independence we will make our place in the major places of the world in tourism.
And surely , in the days of Diwali , arson will be more than firecrackers , and no one will be harmed .
Whatever aversion you must do, you must be averse.
Let's go
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Can you imagine how hard he would have worked to create a constitution of his country full of diversity
The Konkan coastal area, where the sea plays an important role, came under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj, many arts associated with Shivaji Maharaj such as Sindhu Fort, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either located on the beaches or were surrounded by the sea. Maratha navy was responsible for the safety of these castles. Maratha navy had combination of large ships and small boats in Maratha Navy, their navy was very capable of attacking and defending any enemy.
There is no fear of thinking, nor will there be soil, nor will trees and plants grow, where will human life be possible
Where will the organisms be possible
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific methods that Earth and mother suffer severe damage by using more than necessary urea. How can a farmer see Earth and mother sick
Whether our farmers, the sons of our soil, the children of our soil can make this pledge that the number of urea that they use in their fields today, the number of urea in 2022, when 75 years of independence will be 75 years.
The person of North India will not know what is in South India
The person of West India will not know what is in East India
If we look at the diversity of our country, Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, it is a matter of fact that when he made an India-Bharmaan, all these great men have got a new inspiration to see and live for India. In the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India, did we try to live in ourselves, different states of our country, different societies, groups, their customs, their traditions, their food and their beliefs as a learner
Can you keep incredible India (hash tag incredibleindia)
You see, if all the people of a state tell this thing then I will tell the government that they should scrutinize it and prepare publicity on the seven things that came from every state. In a way, how should the tourist destination be encouraged by the people's intentions
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand, when news of violence comes from any corner of India, it is natural for the country to worry.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who gave life to the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, non-violence, respect and respect.
Non-violence Paramo Dharma: This is what we have heard since childhood, we have come to say
I want to assure the countrymen, those who take the law, those who suppress the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, this country will never tolerate it nor will any government tolerate it.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to eating, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every way of life
Even our festivals are full of diversity and due to our cultural heritage thousands of years old, see cultural traditions, see social traditions and historical events, there will hardly be a day left in 365 days while we are not associated with any festival.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals go according to the leaflet at the time of nature
There is a direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly linked to the farmers and are associated with the fishermen.
Today , I am talking about festivals , first of all , I would like to call you dumb , dumb .
Yesterday's festival was celebrated in Jain society
In Jain society festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra .
On the last day of the festival festival is the day of the festival .
This is really a wonderful tradition in itself
The festival of Samvatsari symbolizes forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
It is also called the forgiveness festival in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other sweet dukkadam .
Anyway , forgiveness in our scriptures is the jealousy of the heroes .
Forgiving is hero .
We have heard these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi always said that forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person .
Shakespeare wrote in his drama The Merchant of Defense the importance of forgiveness, Mercy is two blest, I t bless him that gives and him that takes the meaning of forgiveness and forgiveness, both receive the blessings of God
My dear countrymen, these days Ganesh Chaturthi has emerged in every corner of India and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural for the people to talk about Ganesh festival.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and he became a symbol of freedom movement before 125 years of independence .
And after independence, they have become symbols of social-education, social-consciousness.
Ganesh Chaturthi festival lasts for 10 days .
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity.
Greetings to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganesh Festival
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala
One of the colorful festivals of India, Onam is a major festival in Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in the society and awakens a new hope, a new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming the reason for the attraction of tourism.
And I will tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal has become a form of tourism .
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What we can do in that direction should think
A few days after the series of these festivals, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are not only symbols of faith and belief for us but also to make festivals in New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals and sanitation are associated with family life
Preparation of festival means cleanliness
It ' s not a new thing for us , but it ' s also important to make this social temperament .
Cleanliness needs to be an integral part of the festivals, cleanliness in our country, not just in the house, in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definition of being modern is changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern your thought process is, a scale has started to work in knowing all these things.
Eco-friendly, environment-friendly behaviour in your own activities is against him.
In society , if it is against it , it is considered bad today .
And today I see the result of this thing that in these days too, eco-friendly Ganapati has become a big campaign in Ganeshotsav.
If you go to YouTube and see, children in every household are making Ganesh ji, bringing soil and making Ganesh ji.
Likewise every family is being used
See how big a change has come and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is full of crores of stunning minds.
Three years ago when Swachhata campaign started, it will be completed on 2nd October for three years
And, its positive results are visible
Toilets coverage has reached about 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free
There was a severe flood in Gujarat in the past
They lost their lives , but when water was reduced after the flood , there was so much filth everywhere .
At such a time, the workers of Jamiat UlemaHind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
He sweats his own sweat , and they go forth .
Excellent example of unity for cleanliness, such an example that inspires everyone, all the workers of Jamiat Ulemayehind gave away
The efforts made by the dedication to cleanliness, if it becomes our permanent nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again 15-20 days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, Swachhta Hi Sewa was said to be the first to launch a campaign of service to the Lord.
Create an environment for cleanliness throughout the country
As you get the opportunity, wherever you get the opportunity, we find opportunities.
But we ' re all connected
Considering this as a preparation for Diwali, accept it as a preparation for Navaratri in a way, accept the preparation of Durga Puja
Friends of my social media can run some creative campaigns and work on the ground of virtual world.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has been organizing this campaign in which you are competing for essays, short film making competition, painting competition
In this you can write essays in different languages and there is no age limit in them.
You can create short film, make it with your mobile
Make 2-3 minute films that inspire cleanliness
They can be in any language, they can be silent too.
You see how this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine
You can imagine how sacred it would be to pay homage to revered Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after this 15-day campaign of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, I want to accept the loan of all of you in a particular way today.
I want to express my gratitude to you from the depths of the heart, not because you have been associated with the matter of mind for so long I want to express my gratitude, I want to accept the loan because millions of people from all corners of the country join this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of listeners is in crores, but millions of people write letters to me, sometimes give messages, sometimes the message comes on the phone, I have a huge treasure.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages more than what you wait for .
I ' m sorry because everything of you gets me to learn something
You might also think yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake
Sometimes things become a part of Our habit . We do not think that we are lying .
Prime Minister, I am speaking Aparna from Poona
I want to tell you about one of my friends
She always tries to help people , but I ' m surprised to see a habit of it
I went to the mall to shop with him once
He spent two thousand rupees on a sari comfortably and Rs. 450 on pizza while the auto that he had taken to the mall was bargaining for a long time for five rupees from that auto driver.
Buy vegetables on the way back and save Rs 4-5 by bargaining on every vegetable again
I feel very bad
You must tell me about this .
Now after listening to this phone call, I am sure you must have been shocked, alerted and maybe you might have decided not to make such a mistake in the future.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, a ferrying person comes to us, a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller comes to us, sometimes the person who sells vegetables comes in contact with an autorickshaw. Whenever we have a relationship with a hard-working person, we start losing money from him.
And if we eat food in a big restaurant, we don't even see what is written in the bill.
Not only this, if we buy saris in the showroom, there is no bargaining, but if we come closer to a poor person, we do not live without bargaining.
Have you ever thought of what happens to the poor mind
Two Rupees five do not make any difference in your life , but have you ever thought how deep this small habit would possibly push his mind
Madam, I am grateful to you for giving me a message by calling a heart touching phone.
I am sure that my countrymen too will have a habit of behaving with poverty .
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire country celebrates as a national sports day.
This is the birthday of great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to hockey was incomparable
I am reminded that I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Sports become part of our life .
If we are young countries of the world , we should also be seen in this young playground .
Sports i. e. physical fitness, mental alternations, personality enhancement.
The game is in a way a very big herb of heart reconciliation .
The young generation of our country has come forward in the world of sports and today in the era of computer, I would like to warn that playing field is more important than play-station.
Play A , but even in the field outside , sometimes act with Hotball .
Cricket plays on the computer but the joy of playing crickets under the sky in the open ground is something else.
There was a time when the family kids used to go out and the mother first asked when you would come back
Today the condition is that as soon as the children come home, they either start looking at cartoon films or get stuck on mobile games and then they have to shout at the mother and tell her when you will go out.
It is a matter of great pleasure for our youngsters that India is going to host the IAF under 17 World Cup by October 6-28.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world, sports festivals, enjoy sports, create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about the game today, I want to share a very touching event with the countrymen last week.
I got an opportunity to meet some daughters of a very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Will sometimes spend 40-40 days in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will spend in water
Our six daughters with the courage of the waves of the sea and this is the first incident in the world.
Who will be Hindustani who do not descend on our daughters
I salute these daughters and I have told them to share their experiences with the whole country .
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModiApp so that you can read it because this is a story of courage, a story of self-reliance and I am glad to bring these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters, it is a great blessing.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers' Day on 5th September.
The birth anniversary of Dr. Radhakrishnan ji, the former President of our country
He was president but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I salute them. The great scientist, Albert Einstein, had said:
It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
This time when we celebrate Teachers ' Day can we all make a resolve together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we make collective efforts, we will play a very big role in the nation's transformation.
Let's go take this mantra to Teach to Transform
Praise Prime Minister
My name is Dr. Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of the city of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of the World University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, financial inclusion has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also in the entire world about the pundits of the economic world.
On August 28, 2014, the campaign was launched by taking a dream in mind.
Yesterday, on August 28, the campaign for this Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
30 crore new families have been linked to it, bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today, I have a very big solution that within three years, my poor brother sitting on that end of the society has become a part of the fundamentals of the country's economy, his habit has changed, he has started coming to the bank, he has started saving the money and he is feeling the security of the money.
Sometimes money is in hand, they live in pockets, if they are in the house then they want to spend their money.
If you want to do a good job in the coming days, money will be used.
About 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks through our poor in Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
This is the saving of the poor. This is his strength in the days to come.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the account opened has also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Rs. One rupee, Rs.
In many families, due to a rupee insurance, when a poor man suffered a crisis, the life of the head of the family ended, within a few days he got Rs. 2 lakhs.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start Up Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Dalits, Adivasis, women, educated youth, youngsters intending to do something on their feet, crores of youngsters with the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, without getting any guarantee from the banks and they themselves stood on their own feet.
Today there is no such time but I will urge the people of Bank to upload it on MyGov. in. People will get inspiration from the fact that how a scheme brings transformation in the life of the individual, how it fills new energy, how it fills new faith and hundreds of examples have come to me.
I will make every effort to reach you and there is such an inspiring event that people of Media can also take full advantage of it .
They can also inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
Man's mind is such that the rainy season is a very lucky time for mind.
Animals, birds, plants and nature are all pleased with the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a vivid form, then it is known that there is a great deal of destruction of water.
Nature gives us life, preserves us, but sometimes the natural calamities like floods and earthquakes destroys us a lot.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and the environment are also being done in a very negative way.
Over the past few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have suffered natural calamities due to excessive rainfall.
Flood affected areas are being monitored.
Relief works are being done at a broad level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching there.
State governments are also making every effort to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organizations and citizens working with the spirit of service are also making every effort to help people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, be it the soldiers of the army, the people of the Air Force, the people of NCR, the Paramilitary Forces, everyone at such times joins in serving the disaster victims.
And 247 control room helpline number 1078 is continuously working to tackle the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government machinery was prepared by drilling mock at maximum places before the rainy season.
NCR teams were set up
Gradually we also make the nature that we can create our activities according to the weather forecast, then we can avoid harm.
Whenever I prepare for my mind, I see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time so many letters have come about GST, so many phone calls have come and people still express happiness and curiosity about GST.
I also tell you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the speech of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax- GST was started on the date of last month in our country.
Can you tell me whether the results are coming after one month just as the government had executed it
I would like to hear your views about this, thank you.
The implementation of GST is almost a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very satisfied, happy when someone writes to me a letter and tells me how the prices have been reduced due to GST, how things have become cheaper.
If a person living in north-east and far-flung mountains writes a letter in the jungles that initially he was afraid that he didn't know what it was. But now when I started learning about it, I feel that the work has become easier than before.
Trade became easier
And the biggest thing is, customers have started increasing trust in the businessman.
I was just watching how GST was imported on transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How is the time decreasing the distance
Chhighways clutter free.
Due to the speed of trucks, pollution has also decreased.
The goods are also reaching very soon.
This is the facility, but at the same time the economic momentum also gets strength from it.
Earlier, due to different tax structure, maximum resources of transport and logistics sector used to be maintained and they had to create new warehouses within every state.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Tax, has truly created a very positive impact on our economy in a very short time.
The speed at which the youth transition has taken place, the speed at which migration has taken place, new registrations have taken place, this has created a new faith in the entire country.
And sometimes the pundits of the economy, the pundits of the management, the pundits of technology, the use of GST of India will definitely be written in the form of a model before the world.
There will be a case study for many universities of the world.
Because it is a great height of success in itself to implement it and successfully move forward in such a huge country with such a huge change and the invaluation of crores of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation in it, all the states have the responsibility.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center together with the consensus.
And the result of that is that every government has the same priority that there is no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries engaged in this work, all the departments, all the officials of the Central and State Governments.
GST is an excellent example of the success of India's collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform, it is an economy that strengthens the culture of a new integrity.
In a way, there is also a campaign for social reform.
I once again bow down to the people of Koti-Koti to make such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
Easily, we have been listening to this thing since childhood and the reason for this is that the non-cooperation movement started on August 1, 1920.
The uit India Movement began on 9th August, 1942, which is known as the August Revolution and on 15th August, 1947 the country was free.
In a way, several incidents in the month of August have been specially linked to the fate of freedom.
But very few people know that leave India this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Meher Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country who were associated with freedom struggle, struggled and fought, the pages of history are our inspiration to build a grand India.
Our freedom fighters have sacrificed sacrifices, penance and sacrifices, what can be a great inspiration
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This movement had envisaged the whole country for the freedom of British rule.
This was the time when Indian public opinion in every corner of India, village, city, educated, illiterate, poor, rich and everybody had become a part of the movement to quit India.
The public excitement was on its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were roaming in the struggle with the mantra of Do or die.
Millions of youth of the country had left their studies, left the books.
The non-cooperation movement and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 appear two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The forms of non-cooperation movement were different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity increased so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or die.
Behind all this success, there was public support, people-power, people-to-people, people-to-people struggle.
The whole country was fighting together.
And I sometimes think that if you look at the pages of history, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle, which started from 1857, continued in some corner of the country every moment till 1942.
This long period created the heart of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone is committed to doing something or something.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People used to come, join, go, go, join new ones, join new ones and the country continued to strive every moment to overthrow the British rule.
This hard work from 1857 to 1942 created a situation that the British had to go within 5 years to 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, the rhythm of independence reached the masses.
And from 1942 to 1947, it became a peoples mind, it became the reason for giving independence to the country with success in the form of five crucial years of success.
These five years were crucial years.
Now I want to connect you with this mathematics.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's been 70 years.
Governments came-yes
Arrangements were made, changed, flourished, increased.
Everyone has made efforts in their own way to free the country from problems.
Success also got
Expectations also wake up
Like in 1942 to 1947, there was a decisive five years of siddhi.
I see that from 2017 to 2022, a five-year segment of siddhi has come to us.
On 15th August, 2017, we will celebrate this resolution as a festival and when 75 years of independence in 2022, we will continue to transform that resolution into accomplishment.
There are crores of resolutions.
Efforts should be made to fulfill crores of resolutions.
So, like 1942 to 1947, five years have become decisive for the country's independence, these five years can become decisive for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, the country will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then all of us have to take a firm resolve today.
2017 is to make a year of our resolve.
We have to connect with this August month resolution and we have to resolve.
Let's run a Mahabhiyan of Siddhi from August 9 in this month.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Youth organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
New ideas can be exposed.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can I contribute to as a person
Come, let us join the festival of this resolution.
Using technology, videos, posts, blogs, articles, new ideas have come up with all these things.
Convert this campaign into a mass movement.
This ui is an effort to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am convinced that you must spread, spread it widely.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Servant of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from Red Fort.
I am only a nimith and he does not speak a person there.
The voice of hundreds of millions of countrymen echoes from the Red Fort.
Attempts are made to utter their dreams and I am happy that from every corner of the country on August 15, for the last 3 years, I get suggestions that what should I say on August 15 What issues should be taken
I invite you this time too. You must send me your thoughts on MyGov either on NarendraModiApp.
I myself read it and I will try to present it in whatever time I have on August 15.
In the last three years, I have received a complaint in my 15th August speeches that my speech becomes a little longer.
I have tried to make rules for me.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
But I intend to try this time how I ' m going to shorten my speech .
See whether success is achieved or not.
My countrymen, I want to talk about another thing today.
India has a social economics in the economy.
And we should never underestimate that.
Our festivals, our festivals, are not just an occasion of joy and joy.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
And a natural joy is also added to these festivals.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in family, brotherhood in society.
Add persons and society.
A simple journey from the person to the world runs.
Ego becomes an opportunity to go to Vayam.
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, hundreds of families start making rakhi in small domestic industries.
From khadi to silk yarns, not knowing how many rakhis and nowadays people like homemade rakhis more.
Rakhi makers, Rakhi sellers, sweets, thousands of sacks and businesses are associated with a festival.
Our poor siblings and families go by this.
We burn lamps in Deepawali, it is not just a light festival, it is just a festival, it is not like that.
His direct relationship is with those poor families who make small soils.
But today when I talk about the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think that even the people of the country are more aware of me, they are more active.
For the last one month, consistent citizens have written me letters to the environment.
And he has urged that you tell Ganesh about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi before time so that people can plan on the choice of soil.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to say this topic before time.
This time the public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji started the public Ganeshotsav for the sake of collectivity and the spirit of unity and awareness of the society.
Let us once again compete for essays in this year of Ganeshotsav, discuss meetings, remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I said very quickly .
I am sure that all of you will join me and the benefit will be that our poor artisans, poor artists, those who make idols, they will get employment, they will fill the stomach of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching that be it education sector, economic sector, social sector, sports, our daughters are illuminating the name of the country and getting new heights.
We are proud of our daughters.
In the past, our daughters performed greatly in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to them, but I was feeling that the World Cup did not win, it was a big burden on them.
He had pressure on his face too, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different assessment.
I have said that nowadays, the time of media is such that the expectations are increased so much, so much is increased and when success is not achieved, it also changes into resentment.
We have seen many such games that if India's players fail, then the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and speak such things, write such things, there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time that when our daughters could not succeed in the World Cup, hundreds of millions of people took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only this, these daughters praised and praised what they did.
I see it a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you see that you have only got such a good fortune and you should get it out of your mind that you have not succeeded.
Whether or not you win the match, you have won 1.25 million countrymen.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the August Revolution, once again on 9th August, once again on 15th August, once again on 15th August, I will recall the 75th year of independence.
Every citizen of the country should make a 5-year roadmap to fulfil his resolve.
We all have to take the country to new heights, reach and reach.
Come together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country will be better and the future will be better.
Changing weather
This time there was a lot of heat
But it ' s good that the rain is moving on its map in time .
In many parts of the country the weather has become pleasant due to Jhajjham rain
After the rains cold winds have experienced relief from the heat of the past days .
And all of us have seen how difficult it is in life, how stressful it is, individual life, public life, the arrival of rain only changes our mindset.
Today the rath yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated with great reverence and joy in many parts of the country .
Now in some parts of the world the rath yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated .
And the country is closely connected with Lord Jagannath ji
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor
And very few people will know that there is a word in English, juggernaut and that means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And in the dictionary meaning of this juggernaut, it is found that this word has emerged from the chariot of Jagannath.
And so we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way .
On the occasion of Lord Jagannath ji's visit, I extend my greetings to all fellow citizens and also salute Lord Jagannath ji in the scriptures.
Indias diversity is also its characteristic, Indias diversity is also the power of India.
The sacred month of Ramadan celebrated with sacred spirit in worship .
Now is the festival of Eid
My best wishes to all of you on this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramadan is the month of virtue of donation, the month of distributing happiness and the joy that they share
Let us all share the treasures of happiness with inspiration from these sacred festivals.
In this holy month of Ramadan , a great motivation of the Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me .
Nearly three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live there in that small village, in a way more population belongs to brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
Inside this Ramadan the villagers decided to build together toilets .
And within this individual toilet there is help from the government , and the assistance was given to them about Rs . 17 lakhs .
You spend Rs 17 lakhs for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for reversing this holy occasion of Ramadan on the occasion of the good of the society.
We know that there are three such states in our country Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, they have already been declared Open Defecation Free
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also announced this week
I express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, the government and the people and the people to fulfil this task.
We know very well that in the life of the individual, there is something good in the life of the society, we have to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if it is to be corrected, we have to make efforts for a long time to be very conscious.
Then goes to the body, the habit of mind changes
Such is the subject of cleanliness
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature .
Everyone will have to draw attention
Good motivational events have to be remembered again and again
And I am glad that cleanliness has not been a government programme today
This is going on becoming a mass movement.
And as for those who sit in government , when they go ahead with this , how much greater the power increases
In the past, a very good event came to my notice, which I would surely like to tell you.
This is the incident of the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh .
The administration there took up a great deal of public participation .
100 hour non stop campaign
And what was the target
Creating ten thousand domestic toilets in 71 gram panchayats in one hundred hours .
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have successfully completed the construction of ten thousand toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vijayanagaram district that you have presented a very inspiring example by commemorating hard work.
Narendra Modi visits App, MyGov. in, comes from letters, comes from AIR.
Shri Prakash Tripathi, while recalling the Emergency, has written that on 25th June he has presented a period of time in the history of democracy.
This awareness about the democracy of Prakash Tripathi ji is commendable and democracy is not just a system, it is also a ritual.
Democracy needs everyday awareness and therefore we have to recall the trauma of democracy and move forward towards the good things of democracy.
1975 - 25 June - it was such a dark night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into prison.
The opposite tone was suppressed
The dignitaries of the country, including Jayaprakash Narayan, had been jailed.
The system of justice was not able to escape the shadow of that horrific form of emergency.
Newspapers were completely wasted.
The lovers of democracy fought a big fight and the country like India, such a huge country, whenever there was a chance, democracy in the rage of the people of India had demonstrated that power through the election.
We have to further strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling the pride of raising his head in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - The entire world has become Yoga Enabled.
From water to mountain, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning and evening through Yoga.
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this thing.
It is not that Yoga was not the first time but today when Yoga has been tied in the thread, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
When people practicing Yoga on the Great all of China in China, people at the World Heritage Site Machu Pichu in Peru performed Yoga at 2400 meters above sea level.
In France, people have done yoga in the shadow of Eiffel Tower.
In a small place like Singapore, programmes were held at 70 locations and a week long campaign has been launched.
NCC has removed 10 stamps of International Yoga Day.
Coga Session with Coga Masters was organised in the NEEDURTER.
Everyone has participated in the stadium of NCC, Diplomats of the world.
Once again Yoga worked as a world record
Nearly 55 thousand people gathered in Ahmedabad in Gujarat to make a new world record
I also got the opportunity to join the Yoga programme in Lucknow
But for the first time I had the good fortune of doing yoga in the rain .
Our soldiers have done yoga in Siachen where Minus 20, 25, 40 degrees temperature takes place.
Whether it is TBP or CRPF or ICDS, everyone has made Yoga its part along with their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share their photos together.
Some TC Channel also carried this forward
Sir, one of my questions is that in Kerala we had heard from you that we should replace the bouquet as a git on the difference-diversity places and instead give us a kind of good box as a memento.
You started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but we are not able to see this much.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we would not give a bouquet, box or handkerchief would welcome it.
And the handkerchief of Khadi so that Khadi can also be promoted.
As long as I was in Gujarat, we all had become a habit, but after coming here I had missed that habit.
But he went to Kerala, once again he became aware
And I ' ve just started informing the government below again
We can gradually create a habit
And the age of bouquet is very low .
Take it in hand once, then leave
But if you give a box, then in a way it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a part of the family.
And when I am talking about this, how much the historic value of such things is
When I went to K last year, Britain's ueen, ueen Liabeth invited me to dinner in London.
There was a maternal environment
He also did his meal with great love, but later he showed me a small handkerchief of khadi and a handkerchief woven with thread and he said that when I was married, this handkerchief was sent to me as a best wish for marriage.
How many years have passed, but Fueen Liabeth has kept this handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life and became part of his history.
I believe that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be a victim of criticism.
But despite that, such things should be done, efforts should be made.
Now I cannot say that I will go anywhere and if someone comes with a bouquet, I will forbid him and I will not do that.
But still there will be criticism, but if you continue to talk, then there will be gradually improvement
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are several types of work.
The files are drowned, but I have developed a habit for me that I read some letters daily from the letters that come to me and because of that I get an opportunity to join the common man.
Different types of letters come, different types of people write letters
I got an opportunity to read such a letter these days, I think I must tell you.
In the far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife of Madurai Arulmozhi Saranan - he sent me a letter
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economic activity in my family, then the family would get some financial help.
So I started some work in the direction of supplying money from the money scheme, bank and by bringing some goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I noticed that the Government of India has created a system called Government-Marketplace.
So I got myself registered in it. I want to tell my countrymen that if you get an opportunity then you will get an opportunity.
There ' s a new kind of system
And then he has to order
So all the departments of the government are watching those who registry within the GST.
because there are no intermediaries in the middle , things are cheap .
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has made all the registry of the goods that they can provide on this website of the government.
And the funny thing is that the letter they have written to me is very interesting.
This is empowerment
This is the opportunity to promote enterpriseship
Perhaps if Arulmozhi had not written to me, I might not have noticed that a housewife is doing a small job far away from the system of GM, his goods can be purchased to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country
There is also transparency in it, there is also empowerment, there is also entrepreneurship in it.
I would surely like those who want to sell their goods to the government in this way to add more than that.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maimum Governance have a great example of this and its goal is Minimum Price and Maimum Case, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can also be proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the earth connected with Yoga then our dreams are also to cross those horizons of far flung heavens.
India has shown a lot in sports and science in the past.
Today, India is waving its peak not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Nano satellites with Cartosat-2 Series satellite.
And these satellites include France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, USA - nearly 14 countries.
And this non-satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of farming, farming and natural calamities.
And this is the most weighty heaviest satellite in the satellites launched by India so far.
And the newspapers of our country compared it with the weight of the elephants, you can imagine how great our scientists have done in the field of space.
A thousand days of the Mars Mission have been completed on 19th June .
You all will be aware that when we successfully made a place in the orbit for the Mars Mission, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
The completion of a thousand days is an important halt within our scientific journey, within our space journey.
These days, we are also seeing in the sports that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has started to be seen that our young generations have started showing their future in sports as well as in sports.
Recently India ' s badminton player Kidambi Srikanth has won the Indonesia Open and enhanced the value of the country .
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to join the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Athletics of Shasha School of Athletics of P. T. Usha Ji.
The more we promote the game, the more we bring the sportsman spirit.
Sports also plays a very important role in the development of personality
The importance of sports in overall personality development is very high
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports in our family too, they should be given opportunities.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season, the atmosphere of festivals, in a way, the feeling of this period is new.
I once again wish you all good luck and talk about the next mind .
We will hardly forget this year's heat.
But the rain is waiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramadan has already begun.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend warm greetings to the people of India and around the world, especially to the Muslim community, to this holy month.
This is a country that believes in God and those who deny God, those who oppose idol worship and those who oppose idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have assimilated the art of living together.
And after all, religion, sect, ideology, tradition, these messages give us the same message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramadan will certainly help in furthering this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again wish all of you good luck.
I am happy that a lot of people gave me feedback.
Individually everyone showed the enthusiasm to tell me my point.
I have not read everything, I have not even heard the message of everyone, so many things have come.
However, whatever I have seen from Sarasari, someone has tried to learn music, some are trying to learn new instruments, some people are trying to learn new things using you tube and learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, learning some dances, learning some drama, some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing nature, living, understanding, are trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle India had to fight for independence, how many freedom fighters spent years in prisons.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has achieved a lot at a very young age, so I request you to give some messages to today's generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
I visited Andaman Nicobar many years ago.
Cellular went to see the jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a maji-born book in jail.
He used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of torture the freedom fighters have suffered.
When I read a book on the birthplace of Savarkar ji and from that I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
There is a light and sound show, it is a very motivational one.
There was no such state in India that would not be speaking any language of India, who would not have spent his youth in the prison of Andaman, in this cellular jail, in the jail of Andaman for the sake of freedom.
Today, the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji was born.
I would surely tell the youth of the country what kind of torture we had faced and suffered for our freedom. If we visit the Cellular Jail, why was it called Black Water
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with nature means nurturing better planet.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhiji used to say many times: One must care about a world one will not see that we will not see the world, it is our duty to worry about it, we should also care about it.
Open the windows, open the doors, take the breath of fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
When the Panch Mahabhutas are connected to those Panch Mahabhutis then a new consciousness is revealed in our body and a new energy is revealed.
We all have experienced this, but we don't register it, we don't add it in a thread, in a formula.
After that, you must see that whenever you get in touch with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore, the global campaign to join the nature of June 5 should also be our own campaign.
Our ancestors have protected the environment, we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect, our future generations will get the benefit.
In the Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the origin of power.
And Atharvaveda is completely, in a way, the largest guideline of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We have been told Mata Bhoomi: Son ego isolation.
It has been said in the Vedas that the purity in us is due to our Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is certainly revealed that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the attainment of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana was under three trees.
These days I keep getting information from the states.
There is a huge drive for plantation in almost all the states as soon as rain comes.
Plants are planted in crores.
The children of the school are also linked, socio-service organizations join, NGOs join, the government itself takes initiative.
We should also encourage and contribute to this work of planting trees in this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become the 21st June day for the world.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day has failed in every corner and is connecting people.
On the one hand, many talents of scattering in the world are showing their distorted faces, at such a time, the world has a huge contribution of India.
We have added the world to a formula through yoga.
Like yoga, body, mind, intellect and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to morale and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress free life.
And even at the young age of seeing this thing, this situation has reached.
Yoga plays an important role in taking unnatural medicines and passing the day, to lead a stress-free life in such a hour.
Yoga is a guarantee of both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through Yoga to experience an interval of health from stem, from body, from thought, from ethics.
Just two days back, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world regarding Yoga Day.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga and announced some rewards.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and I am told that you appeal that this time three generations of the same family together on the third International Yoga Day.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents, parents, sons and daughters, all three generations together and upload their pictures.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, there will be such a good coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we people had launched a selfie with a daughter campaign and had a very interesting experience.
This three-generation picture of Yoga will surely awaken the country and the world.
You must send a picture to me on NarendraModiApp, on MyGov, three generations wherever you do yoga.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be the guarantee of a beautiful tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have nearly three weeks for International Day of Yoga.
You should also propagate the subject of Yoga for three weeks continuously, spread it, add people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive health care.
I invite you all to join it.
This phone call will also bring you into consideration: Pranam Modi Ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today, I always see Modi ji on TV and in the social media, wherever you go, the people of that place pay special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
Old and old, children have also got awareness about cleanliness.
Many times he has seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, touching them.
The government machinery works as cleaning, but these days there is a festival of cleanliness in the society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are plenty of cleaning programs.
The media also gives him a big priority and just a few days back I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There's a very big cleaning campaign.
I didn't even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I started thinking and I saw that yes, this thing is correct.
You can imagine, knowing how much pleasure I am and how the country is doing well in these things.
What would be more happy for me than that cleanliness has also been added to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the reception of the Prime Minister will be habitual, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is enjoyable and inspiring for any cleanliness in itself.
I congratulate all those who emphasize the work of this cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well, that's a big funny suggestion.
I don't know if I can do this or not.
Modi ji, when you decide on your stay, ask those who ask for migration, what kind of cleanliness will be the level of cleanliness if I have to call you.
How many tons of garbage will you meet me on the basis of that, I will set my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big a humanity will be.
One thing I must say is that we do not consider this waste as waste, it is wealth, it is a resource.
Do not see it just as garbage.
Once we start accepting this garbage as well as wealth, many new ways of waste management will come to us.
The Government of India has decided to launch a massive campaign of waste management with the help of the representatives of the cities with the help of State Governments.
Solid waste and liquid waste will be available in about 4,000 cities of the country on World Environment Day on 5th June.
Two types of dustbins will be available, one grain of colour and the other of blue colour.
Like the waste of kitchen, vegetable peels, remaining food, egg peels, leaves of trees and plants, all these are wet wastes and put them in green dustbin.
If you remember the colour of the farm so much then you will remember what to put in green dustbin.
Today, I have to remember one thing with pride - if a person decides on his mind then how big a mass movement can be created.
The work of cleanliness is the same.
And the way in which he added people from all over the region and converted them into a mass movement, this is an inspirational example in itself.
I was told that the Reasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that the entire movement has been leading the most - the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out torch visits to create awareness and inspired people from home, street and street.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days and months, there has been a three-year accounting of the present government, whether it is newspapers, TV channels or social media.
I see this process as a very healthy sign.
This 3-year term has been done on every criterion.
People of every section of the society have analyzed it.
And there is an excellent process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that governments should be accountable in democracy, people and people should give account of their work.
I thank all those people who took time out and discussed our work in depth, appreciated somewhere, somewhere supported or somewhere, some deficiencies were brought out, I consider all these things very important.
Whether it is good or less good or bad, whatever it is, learn from it and move forward with the same support.
Constructive Criticism strengthens democracy.
For a conscious nation, for a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of everything is similar to me as it is on the minds of a common citizen.
Some people also criticize him politically, but after such a long experience I feel that when I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, I didn't even think about it.
It seems as if I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk about home.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President, the Speaker, that he has taken time out and the people sitting in such a senior position have given this importance to the matter of mind.
In a way, given a new dimension to the mind in itself.
When some of our friends were working on this book of mind, they had ever discussed with me.
Akbar Saheb proposed that the topics that have been discussed in Mann Ki Baat want to prepare a sketch through his art and to show his love without taking a single rupee, Akbar Saheb made his mind into art.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, by the time we meet next time, there will have been rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the beginning of a new life will start from a new end, and as soon as the rains come, a new happiness, a new spectacle, a new fragrance.
Come, let us all go ahead with love for nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
s.
In Skill Development this aspect can be emphasized a little bit
You run cycles, but have you tried to run a three-wheeler cycle that takes people
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the exams of their children
Those whose exams have been abolished, there will be a problem of relieve and there will still be a little pressure among those families where the exams will be run.
But at such a time, I would like to say that the last time I had talked to the students about the things that I had spoken to them, you would certainly be able to do those things during the examination.
Today is 26th March
26th March is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh
I wish Bangladesh march ahead, develop and convince the Bangladeshi people that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within the entire region by shaking our shoulders.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are a shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize, but he was also given the title of Knighthood by the British.
And when the British slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the great men who raised his voice and this was the period when the incident had a profound impact on the mind of a 12-year-old child.
In adolescence, the boy laughing in the fields and barns gave a new inspiration to life by the brutal assassination of Jallianwala Bagh
And in 1919, the 12-year-old kid Bhagat is our beloved, inspired by all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on March 23, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that the incident on March 23 - the satisfaction of serving Mother India on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - there was no fear of death
All the dreams of life were incorporated for the freedom of mother India.
And these three heroes still inspire us
We will not be able to decorate the saga of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words
And the British kingdom was afraid of these three youths .
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but the British were worried about how to go ahead with them.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23
Was stolen, which was not usually done
And afterwards, the British had quietly burnt his body in Punjab today.
Many years ago when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to experience a kind of vibration in that land.
And I would surely tell the youth of the country - whenever you get a chance, you must visit Punjab instead of the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when freedom, its intensity, its spread continued to grow
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - 10 April 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi did Champaran Satyagraha
This is the year of the century of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the movement of India's freedom, Gandhi's idea and Gandhi style, its first appearance appeared in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the entire freedom movement, especially in the spirit of struggle.
This was the period when the Satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill-workers in Ahmedabad and all of them had a profound impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and style of functioning.
Gandhi returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country .
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind.
Imagine a person who came back to India in 1915, just two years
Neither the country knew them nor did they have an impact, it was just the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they had to suffer at that time, how hard they had to work.
And the Champaran Satyagraha was such that Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, the power to know the pulse of Mahatma Gandhi's Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour, the poorest of the poor in front of the British Sultanate, organising, motivating and bringing the illiterate person to the ground for struggle, shows this wonderful power.
And so the way we experience Mahatma Gandhi ' s diversity
But if you think of Gandhiji who had started the Champaran Satyagraha a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who started his public life.
We can learn from them how public life can be started, how hard we have to work ourselves and how Gandhi did it
And that was the time when we listen to the names of the big leaders, Gandhi had sent them to the villages like Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ji.
Prisoning on one side, and on the other hand consuming yourself in creative work
A great amazing balance was in Gandhi's style of functioning.
What is the word satyagraha, what can be the disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a great Sultanate - a whole new diversity was established by Gandhi not by words but by a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, then who would be the Indian who would not want to change India
India is neither a government program nor a political party's manifestation nor a project.
India calls for 1. 25 billion countrymen
This is the spirit that 125 crore countrymen want to build a grand India
There are many people who go to hospital everyday, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know
There are many people who are hungry, they worry about their food.
Our country is multicultural
People's service, this is in our veins
Once we look at it as a collectivity, organisedly, then how big it is
If we talk of an India, it is very natural to be criticised, discussed, to look at it from a different perspective and it is inevitable in democracy.
But it is true that if 1. 25 billion Indians resolve to resolve, decide on the path to realise their resolve, take steps after each other then the dream of a New India can be proved in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are from budget, from government projects, from government money.
If every citizen resolves to follow the rules of traic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities with sincerity, if every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use petrol-diesel in my life.
You see this country, the dream of a New India, 1. 25 billion countrymen, they will be able to see it fulfilling their eyes.
Saying means that every citizen follows his citizenship, follows his duty
So why shouldn't we join Swaraj in this journey of Suraj by disciplining our lives and pledging them
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, such an environment has been created in our country. A large number of people have joined the Digital Payment Digital Movement.
The curiosity has also increased without any cash transactions, is trying to learn from the poorest of the poor and gradually people are moving towards it without any cash transactions.
There has been considerable increase in the different methods of digital payment since the demonetization ban on bondage.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 1. 25 billion Indians resolve to work for digital transactions in this one year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life
You don't imagine, but you can serve the country a lot and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Several programmes of Digidhan Mela have been organized for public education in the past.
There is a resolution to do 100 programs across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward plan
About twelve lakh people have received this reward from the consumer .
14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
And as it was decided a long time ago, on 14th April, the Digital Mela will be concluded on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
It ' s going to be a grand event after a hundred days .
There is also a provision for a large draw
We should contribute in how to reduce cash, how to reduce the behavior of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I seek suggestions from people for Mann Ki Baat, there are many other suggestions.
But I have seen that every time there is an insistence on cleanliness
A bitia named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a student of 11th, has sent a message by phone: - Hon'ble Principal, Prime Minister, Your Excellency
First of all, you are very much grateful that you have won this election with huge votes.
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want people to explain how important cleanliness is .
I drive through a river wherein people cast lots of garbage and contaminate the rivers .
The river flows through the Rispana Bridge and comes to my house
And We went to the townships for the river , and We brought forth a rally , and We spoke to the people , but they had no benefit .
I want to tell you that by sending one of your teams or by highlighting this through newspaper, thank you.
See, brothers and sisters, how much pain is a daughter of class 11th
Looking at the garbage in that river, he's getting so angry
I consider it a good sign .
This is what I want to do. 125 crore countrymen get annoyed with dirt.
Once there will be anger, annoyance, fury will be created against it, we will start doing something against dirt.
And it is good that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger and suggesting to me, but at the same time he himself is saying that he made a lot of efforts, but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement .
Failure for dirt is also increasing .
Whether it is awareness, active participation, movement, it has its own importance.
But the sanitation movement is more related to the habit .
The work is difficult, but it is to be done.
I am confident that in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, this feeling that has awakened in itself indicates good results.
Whatever is listening to Gayatri in my mind today, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat, I have been receiving several suggestions from the very beginning and most of them have expressed concern about food wastage.
Half of the plates that are filled in the stomach do not fill them in the stomach and then leave them there.
You have ever wondered how much wastage we do with what we leave these lies.
Have you ever thought that if you don't leave the lips, how many poor can they fill the stomach
This is not the subject that has to be explained.
However, when the mother serves the young children in our family, she says that the more you can eat, the more you can eat, the more you can eat it.
Some or the other efforts are being made, but still the indifference to this subject is a social treachery.
ID is injustice to the poor
Secondly, if there is savings then the family also has financial benefits.
Imagine for the society, it is a good thing, but this topic is such that the benefit of the family is also beneficial.
I am not appealing much on this subject, but I would like this awareness to be increased.
In every state of India, you will find such people.
Their life can also inspire us not to fail.
We should take as much food as possible.
See, these are the ways for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body, they always say - keep the stomach too slightly empty, keep the plate a little bit strong.
And when it comes to health, it is World Health Day on 7th April.
The United Nations has set a target of health for all by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word depression, but if we have to make a literal sense then some people call it depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from depression.
The trouble is that we cannot understand this thing around us and perhaps we are hesitant to talk about it openly.
The person who himself feels depression does not speak anything because he feels a bit embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that depression is not such that it cannot get rid of it.
A psychological environment has to be created and it starts.
The first mantra is, instead of suppression of expression, it requires expression.
In the midst of your colleagues, between friends, between parents, between brothers and teachers, what is happening to you
Occasionally children living in hostels, especially those living alone, suffer more.
Everyone in the house is going out somewhere, he says - No, I don't want to come today - I like to stay alone.
Have you ever noticed why it does
You must believe that it is the first step in the direction of expression.
If he doesn't like to stay in a group with you, he is going alone in a corner, then try not to let this happen.
Give him an opportunity to stay in the midst of those people who talk openly with him.
Inspire him to express his joy and joy, expel what kind of frustration is there inside him.
This is the best way
and depression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases
Like Viabetes becomes a pilgrimage to all kinds of diseases, Depression also destroys all our capabilities of fighting, courage, decision-making and deciding.
Your friends, your family, your premises, your environment can stop you from going to the depression.
There is another way ID
Help me, share their happiness and sorrow, you will see that the pain within you will be eradicated.
If you try to understand their sufferings, you do it with service, you will have a new confidence in you.
You can easily lighten the burden of your mind by connecting with others, serving someone, and serving with selflessness.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in reducing stress, emancipation from pressure, dedication towards a happy mind.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
This will be the third year.
If you have any suggestions regarding the Third International Yoga Day, you must send your suggestions to me through my mobile application and guide me.
Whatever songs and poetic compositions you can prepare in relation to Yoga, it should be done so that people can easily understand it.
I would surely like to talk to my mothers and sisters today because today the discussion of Health has come out very well, the health issues have become sufficient.
So in the past, the Government of India has made a major decision.
The working class women in our country, our women in the working class and their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and they are welcome but women also have special responsibilities.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision.
These working class women will now be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery, at the time of delivery, at the time of delivery, at the time of maternity leave which was received for the first 12 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us.
India has made a very important decision for our sisters.
And its basic objective is to take care of that newborn, to the future citizen of India, to take care of it in the early days of birth, and to enjoy the love of the mother, then these children will grow up and become the guests of the country.
The health of mothers will also be good and therefore this is a very important decision.
And this will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April is the holy festival of Ram Navami, on 9th April is Mahavir Jayanti, on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Let all these great men continue to inspire us to resolve for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nav Samvatsar, I convey my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
This is the time for the farmers to start cooking crops after you and get the result of their hard work.
This New Year is celebrated in different forms in different corners of our country.
Gudi-Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as a New Year in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Samvatsar Puja in the area of Awadh, Twin-Seetal in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani festival in Magadha is held on New Year.
Innumerable, India is a country full of such diversity.
Winter season is now to go
The season of spring has rushed us all to life .
New leaves start coming in the trees after the fall .
Flowers bloom
Gardens become green
The color of the birds begins to feel the mind .
Not only flowers, fruits also appear bright in the sun on the branches of the tree
Fruits of summer start appearing in the spring of mango .
At the same time, yellow flowers of mustard in the fields bind the hopes of the farmers
Flowers of tesu or palash indicate the presence of holi .
The rich ones have described the moments of this change .
The festival of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi paints the lives of human beings
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood, humanity, we are going to leave Phalgun in the last month and are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
Indeed , you are indeed a coincidence for these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of citizens of the country on the fact that when I ask for suggestions, there are many suggestions.
On NarendraModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post, I am grateful to all for this.
And so he said that I ' ll give some information about the launch and interceptor missiles of 104 satellites
Shobha ji, you are extremely grateful that you remembered the example of India's pride.
Whether it is to deal with poverty, to avoid diseases, to connect with the world or to reach out to the world, technology has entered its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in the life of India.
Our scientists have raised the head of India proudly before the world
Through the Mega Mission, the SCR has successfully launched 104 satellites in the field of USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together
And it is also heartening that this is a successful launch of the 38th PSL
It is a historic achievement for the SCR, but for the entire India.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is extremely important - Cartosat 2 - this is the satellite of India and it will help him in the planning of the pictures, resources, infrastructure, development assessment, urban development.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water is available in the country, how much it can be used, what should it be kept in mind, this new satellite artosat 2 will help us a lot.
Our satellite has sent a few photos as soon as they go.
He has started his work
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that all these campaigns have been led by our young scientists, women scientists and women scientists.
Such a strong partnership of youth and women is a very proud aspect in the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
They have always kept their objectives for the common people, for the service of the nation, for bringing innovative science and new records are also being created.
The more we congratulate our scientists and their entire team, the less we are
Shobhaji has asked another question and that is in relation to the security of India
India has achieved a great achievement, about it
This is not much discussed yet, but Shobha ji's attention has been noticed on this important thing
This mission of interception technology has achieved success by stacking the enemy's missile at a height of about 100 km from the ground during its trial.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security
And you will be glad to know that there are only four or five countries in the world that have this mastery
When we see new technology, there is a new scientific achievement then we feel happy.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life
And those who have special intellectual talent do not allow curiosity to remain in the form of curiosity, they also question within it, find new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And that becomes the reason for a new discovery.
They do not sit comfortably until they get the answer
And if we look at the development journey of thousands of years of human life then we can say that this development journey of human life is not a complete break.
Full break is impossible
Efforts to know the universe, the rules of the universe, the mind of the humans are constantly going on.
New science, new technology is generated from that.
And every technology, every new science form gives birth to a new era.
My dear youngsters, when we talk of the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in my mind that our youth should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientist causes a permanent change in the life of generations to come in the coming ages .
In the past, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a major Union competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Social useful innovation invites
Sometimes the problem also reflects the importance of science to solve .
This means that in society, people of this kind of role are very much in the country.
And our society is also becoming technology driven.
The systems are becoming technology driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
Large force is visible on digitization in the past
Gradually people are moving from cash to digital currency
Digital transportation is growing rapidly in India too.
In our country, Lucky Client Scheme, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme has received huge support
Nearly two months have passed, 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is heartening to note that under the Digi-Dhan Yojana so far 10 lakh people have been rewarded, more than fifty thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 1.
Under this scheme, more than 100 customers are those who have received a reward of Rs. 1 lakh each.
There are more than four thousand merchants who have received a reward of fifty-five thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, merchants, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it and they are getting the benefits.
When I asked his analysis, "Brothers and sisters, only the youngsters come to see that even the elderly people come and I am glad that those who receive the reward are 15 years old and they are seventy-seven years old.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysore expressed his happiness and wrote on NarendraModiApp that he received a reward of Rs.
Now they drive a car but in a way they have become ambassadors of this scheme.
All the passengers are given full time knowledge of digital
They keep talking with so much enthusiasm and encourage others too.
I will urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country and the Lucky Customer Scheme either Digi-Dhan Business Scheme - the rewards they have received from them that you should become its ambassador.
You should lead this movement.
Please take this forward and this work has a very important role in the fight against corruption and black money in a way.
Everyone associated with this work is a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way, you are a soldier of cleanliness.
You know that Lucky Customer Plan - 100 days when it will be completed.
14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On 14th April, a huge amount of crores of rupees will be drawn.
There are about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
The 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar has just passed.
This time the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and the BHIM.
Therefore, I would like to say that the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb has been strengthened.
I want to reach up to 125 crore households by connecting everyone to BHIM App.
The impact of the movement that has been going on for the last two-three months is that several towns and villages have achieved a lot of success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village enhances the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you something very happy today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to provide food grains.
The hard work of the farmers in our country has resulted in record food production this year.
All the indications are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there has been a wave in the fields like Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I want to especially thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voices of the poor and nearly two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land cultivated different pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service of the poor of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are particularly grateful for the way my farmers have worked hard on their heads and their record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, this has been going on in this direction of cleanliness by our country, by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations, by everyone.
In a way, everyone is seen to be aware of cleanliness in some form or the other.
The government is making constant efforts.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, under the leadership of our Secretary, a programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments was organised in Telangana.
And not just seminars in closed rooms in Warangal, Telangana state, but also using what is the significance of direct sanitation.
On 17-18 February, I had organized a Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise in Hyderabad.
Six household toilet pits were evacuated and the authorities themselves showed that the pits used by twin pit toilets could be used and re-used.
He also showed how comfortable the toilets of this new technology and there is no inconvenience in cleaning these toilets, there is no hesitation, which is a psychological barrier, it is also not hindered.
And we can clean up the pits of a toilet just as we can do more ordinary cleaning.
And this effort has resulted in a lot of propaganda by the media of the country, it has also given importance to it and it is natural when an ICD is being promoted.
If the ASH officer himself cleanses the toilet pit then it is very natural to take care of the country.
And if we look at this thing from the point of view of fertilizer then this is a kind of black gold.
We can see what is wealth from waste.
And that ' s proved
A standard two Pit Toilet for a six-member family - this model is filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily redirected and redirected in the second pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste deposited in the pit is completely decomposed.
This decomposed waste is very safe to handle and fertilizer is extremely important fertilizer NPK
Farmers are well aware of NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - this is full of nutrients and it is considered to be the best manure in agriculture.
The way in which the government has taken this initiative, others must have done a lot of initiatives like this.
And now , in Doordarshan , there is a special program of cleanliness news
The more such things will be exposed, the more it will benefit.
The government also celebrates the Swachhta Pakhwada Regular.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with them, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, is going to strengthen the cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March and two Ministries - Ministry of Shipping Transport and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - are also going to carry forward the Swachhta Abhiyan in the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the entire country feels a new energy, it increases self-confidence.
We all welcomed the performance performed by our Divyang players at Rio Paralympics.
India has made the country proud by becoming a world champion for the second consecutive time by defeating Pakistan in the field of Blind T-20 World Cup held this month.
I once again congratulate all the players of the team
The country is proud of the achievement of our Divyang colleagues
I always believe that brothers and sisters with disabilities are capable, determined, bold and determined.
Every moment we can get to learn something from them
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone
They are walking on foot and illuminating the country with their achievements .
Our women sportspersons won silver medal in the last few days
My best wishes to all those players
8th March Celebrates World Women's Day
Giving importance to daughters in India, increased awareness about them in family and society, increased sensitivity
Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao This movement is progressing at a fast pace
Today it ' s not just a government program
This has become a social sensitivity, a campaign for public education
During the last two years, this programme has added to the general public opinion, has forced people to think about this vivid issue in every corner of the country and has brought about a change in the thinking of people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When it comes to the news that the festival was celebrated on the birth of a daughter, so much joy comes.
In a way positive thinking towards daughters is causing social acceptance
I have heard that Uddalore district of Tamil Nadu has banned child marriage under a special campaign
So far more than 175 child marriages have been stopped
District Administration opens bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana and efforts are being made by the district administration to adopt orphaned girls, to ensure their education.
A campaign to educate rural-rural daughters is underway under every household knock programme in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to re-recruit and motivate the girls who had droped out by running their school campaign.
It means to say that this movement has also taken several forms to teach daughter Bachao-daughter
The entire movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are associated with him
He has been diverted as per local requirements
You ' re also actively involved .
You get me a lot to know
What is going on on on earth, village, what is going on in the mind of the poor, it reaches me
I am very grateful to you for your contribution
Yesterday, Shri Krishna Janma-Mahotsav was celebrated across India
Someone can imagine what kind of personality it will be today, even after thousands of years, every festival brings innovation, brings new inspiration, brings new energy and thousands of years old life is such that even today, who can give examples, inspires, everyone can find solutions to the problems faced by Shri Krishna.
Sometimes the task of lifting the rocks, sometimes lifting the food leaf, that is, a newness is felt in everything. And therefore, today, when I am talking to you, I pay attention to two Mohans.
A Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, and the other Charkhadhari Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan leaves the Yamuna coast, goes to the coast of the sea in Gujarat, stays in the city of Dwarka and is born on the coast of the sea.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan in the circumstances of that time, thousands of years ago, to avoid war, to avoid conflict, to fulfil his duties, his ability, his thoughts, his thinking, and the Charkhadhari Mohan also chose a path for freedom, to save the human values, to empower the fundamental elements of personality - has turned the war of independence into a form that is a wonder for the whole world, even today it is a wonder
Be it the significance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling among all the fluctuations in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and therefore Shri Krishna has also been known as Jagatguru Krishna Vande Jagadguruam
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and is discussing not only in India but also in the entire world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
He served those farmers who were being discriminated in Champaran, who served those mill workers who were not being paid due wages, who considered the service of poor, destitute, weak and hungry people as the ultimate duty of their lives.
Whoever, wherever needed, was always present for the service of Mahatma Gandhi
He not only emphasized on service but also on self-confidence associated with it
The meaning of the term ' service ' is that it should be done with joy - service Paramo Dharma :
But, at the same time, excellent joy, self-reliant: The feeling of this spirit is also inherent in service.
We can understand this from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual and the society, human and humanity, all this was
Whether it is Phoeni Carm in Africa or Tolstoy Carm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha in all places, in a unique way, they have always emphasized on social promotion community mobilisation.
It has been my privilege that I have got the opportunity to visit several important places related to revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to emphasize the organisational sentiments by serving
Social-Service and Community Mobilisation This spirit that we have to bring into our practical life
In the true sense, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No countrymen
and collectivity has its own strength
In the programmes of Gandhi 150, there should be collectivity and service.
Our ladies are club
However, all the stakeholders of the ladies and clubs of the modern era will work together.
can do a lot
Collect books, distribute old, poor, disseminate knowledge, and I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore enterprises.
There is no limit to those who come to the mind - just wish for good, goodwill, goodwill and complete dedication, and that too for the feeling of a unique happiness.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi are a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art Museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
The emotions from within your mind will be more powerful than any major literature. And maybe in today's times, in your eyes, the form of a Gandhi written by your pen, perhaps even more relevant.
A lot of programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But in this context one thing is very interesting which I want to share with you
Haripura Panels were particularly interesting in this
You will remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat where the incident of Subhash Chandra Bose's Presidential election was recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Prior to the Haripura session of Congress in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of the Shanti Niketan Art Building.
Gandhiji wanted him to show the lifestyle of people living in India through art and his heart work should be performed during the session .
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose artwork enhances the beauty of our constitution .
gives a new identity to the Constitution
And his art practice has immortalized the Constitution as well as the Nand Lal Bose
Nand Lal Bose visits the village around Haripura and finally creates some art canvas showing the lives of rural India
This precious artwork had a tremendous discussion in the nice
Once again, with the best wishes on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I expect someone from every Indian to take a pledge.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for someone else
This will be Bapu's good, true, authentic work
Mother India's sons, you will remember that in the last few years, we run Swachhta Hi Seva Abhiyan across the country for nearly 2 weeks before 2nd October.
This time it starts on September 11 .
During this time, we will leave our homes and work for Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdan.
Whether it is home or corridors, square-square or drains, schools, colleges and all public places have a great campaign of cleanliness.
Similarly, we have to end the use of single use plastic together.
This will save money and they will also be able to contribute to protecting the environment .
This time, on 2nd October, when we celebrate Bapus 150th birth anniversary, we will not only dedicate him to an open defecation free India but also lay the foundation of a new mass movement against plastic in the country.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day
I appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected then come forward for its proper disposal and disposal.
It can be recycled
It can be fueled .
Thus by this Diwali we can also complete the safe disposal of this plastic waste .
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit is in a way a gem of knowledge.
We can get what we want in life .
These days my contact has become very low , but I had a lot of contact before .
Stupid people call stones gems
Our culture has glorified a lot of food .
until We have changed the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborns, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Nutrition through modern scientific methods across the country is being made a mass movement under Nutrition Campaign
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes one thing was brought in my mind
A handful of paddy has become a big movement inside the nerve .
It collects a handful of grains from the people of Anganwadi in the days of harvesting .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
The donor becomes an aware citizen social worker in a way .
After that he himself becomes dedicated to this goal and becomes a soldier of that movement .
All of us have heard of food processing in every corner of India in our families
This is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
Diuid did not do solid food
In 2010, Gujarat thought that children should be given complimentary food on the occasion of new food processing so that people can be aware of it.
This is a great initiative, which can be adopted everywhere.
In many states people run date meal campaigns
If there is a birthday or auspicious day in the family, then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food, they go to schools and the family members themselves serve children.
share their joy and enjoy
A wonderful union of service and joy is seen .
Friends, there are many small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, in the absence of awareness, both the poor and the vulnerable families are affected by malnutrition.
Sept. Monthly Nutrition Campaign to be celebrated across the country
You must connect with it, get information, add something new.
If you bring a single person out of malnutrition , we bring the country out of malnutrition .
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there will be a lot of questions about this matter and that too in the last few weeks, wherever I have met people, there is also a mention of Man vs. Wild.
With this episode I have not only joined the youth of India but also have never thought that in this way I will become a place for my young hearts.
I never thought how many diverse things our country and the world ' s youth pay attention to
I never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the heart of the youth around the world .
And what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that whenever I got the opportunity to go as Prime Minister and the situation has become due to International Yoga Day that if I go to anybody in the world, some or the other five-seven minutes I ask questions about Yoga.
Perhaps there will be a great leader of the world who has not discussed with me about Yoga and has experienced me all over the world .
But these days a new experience is coming .
Whatever you get, wherever you get a chance to talk, they discuss about Wildlife, discuss about environment.
Tiger, ion, creatures and I'm surprised how interested people are
Discovery has planned to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their language
I hope that in such a scenario, this episode of Discovery Channel will be very helpful in familiarizing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in the sanskar Yatra of India. And now people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India.
But there is another interesting thing that some people ask me one thing with hesitation that Modi ji was speaking Hindi and Bear Grylls don't know Hindi then how would it be so fast
Is this edited later
This has been Shooting so many times. What has happened
They ask inquisitively .
Look, there's no secret in it
Reality is that technology was used a lot in conversations with Bear Grylls
So I used to speak Hindi but he used to hear English and due to that the dialogue became very easy and this is the wonder of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You must also visit the places related to nature and life.
I have said before, I must say that you must go to North-East in your life.
will expand within you
The country filled with diversity will also fill you with these diversities as a teacher, with diversity from within
Last month I had the privilege of issuing Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
Tiger population in India is 2967
A few years ago half of it was difficult
Tiger summit took place in Russia's Saint Petersburg in 2010 on tigers.
There was a resolution expressing concern about the decreasing number of tigers in the world.
It was a resolution to double the number of tigers all over the world by 2022.
We doubled our number of tigers in 2019 itself
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of protected areas and community reservoirs has increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister, the habitat of lions was shrinking in the forests of Gir.
Their numbers were decreasing
We took a number of steps in the pit .
In 2007, she decided to deploy female guards
Improve infrastructure to boost tourism
Whenever we talk of nature and wildlife, we only talk about conservation.
But, now we have to go beyond conservation and think about compassion.
In Our scriptures there has been a good guidance .
Therefore, we need to not only preserve our forests, vegetation and wildlife but also create an environment so that they can flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda ji on September 11, 1893
This young sannyasin of India, who shocked the human race all over the world, left a stunning identity of India within the world.
The words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893 forced the world to change the vision of looking towards India
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji had seen the form of India that Swami Vivekananda ji had to know the power of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that 29th August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
This will be a big interesting campaign for everyone, for children, elderly, youth, women and this will be your own.
But his nuances aren ' t going to tell me today
I want to make you aware of the fitness and set some goals for the country for the Fit India.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you in It India on 29th August.
Let us move forward with a new zeal, a new resolve, a new strength.
My dear countrymen, today we will meet again in the matter of mind.
I'll wait for your ideas, your suggestions.
Let us all come together to realize Gandhi's dreams of making India the dreams of the freedom fighters.
Let ' s enjoy the inner joy with a sense of service .
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
On January 26, we celebrated our Republic Day with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way this ritual festival also celebrates the future generations towards democracy, towards democratic responsibilities.
But still in our country, the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens - the depth of debate should be debated, the widespread discussion should not be held yet.
I hope that at every level, at every time, as much force is given on the rights, the same strength should be given on the duties.
Only on two tracks of rights and duties, India's democracy can move forward at a fast pace.
Yesterday is 30th January, the death anniversary of our lord Bapu.
On January 30, we pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping silence for 11 o'clock in the morning and 2 minutes.
As a society, as a country, 2 minute tribute at 30 January, 11 o'clock, this should be a simple nature.
Why not be 2 minutes, but there is also collectivity, resolution and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country, there is a simple respect for the army, the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the heroes and their families on various gallantry awards.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal - many categories.
When we know deeply about their courage, valour and valour, we are surprised, proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were all happy with the news of the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, the soldiers of our army in Kashmir who were engaged in the defense of the country received the brave-hearts due to avalanches.
I pay homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I keep talking about my mind continuously.
January, February, March, April - All these months are the months of criteria in every family.
There are eams of one or two children in the house, but the entire family is buried under the weight of exams.
So I was convinced that this is the right time that I should talk to students friends, talk to their practitioners, their teachers, because for many years, wherever I went, the examination was a big problem.
The family is disturbed, the students are disturbed, the teacher is disturbed, a very strange psychological environment is seen in every house.
And I have always felt that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk in detail with young friends.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere cannot be happy
Well, the question has been asked by the creation, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
This festival should be a festival of excitement and excitement.
There are very few people, for whom there is a clearance in the exam, for most people there is a prescribed exam.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a pressure.
The person who accepts the pleasure will be able to regret the pressurrection.
Therefore, I believe that the examination is a festival, take the exam as if it is a festival.
And when the festival takes place, when the festival takes place, the best thing that happens within us comes out.
The feeling of the society is also at the time of the festival.
This is the festival.
There should also be an atmosphere of festivals in the entire family, friends and neighborhood.
You see, this will be converted into pressure and pleasure.
Festival environment will make the burden free.
And I urge parents to create an environment for these three-four months.
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months of examinations are conducted.
It is the responsibility of all of us to change these three-four months every year in our own way, taking our traditions, taking the environment of our families and changing them to the festival.
And you must have seen that when you are happy and smiling, you find yourself relaxed easily and when you are relaxed, you can easily remember the old things of your years.
A year ago, what the teacher said in the classroom, the whole scene is remembered.
And you should know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you are in tension, then all the doors are closed, they don't go inside, they don't come out.
There is a stagnation in the thought process, it becomes a burden in itself.
You were the one who didn't tell me.
But whoever was inside came out immediately and came out because you were relaxed.
Therefore, if there is any medicine to recall memory then it is relaxation.
And I can say this with my gratitude that if there is pressure then we forget our things and relax, then we can never imagine, suddenly such things are remembered, they are very useful.
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge, your knowledge are suppressed and your tension gets rid of it.
And that is why it is necessary that A chapy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet. Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the examination in the proper-perspective.
It seems that he is a question of life and death.
The exam that you are going to give is the exam of what you have studied in a year.
This is not the test of your life.
What kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you are living, what kind of life you want to live, there is no exam.
In your life, in your classrooms and innovations, there must have been opportunities to pass through several tests.
Therefore, we have to give the exams something from the success of life, get rid of such a burden.
They went to the Air Force and became affiliated.
Assume that if he was disappointed due to that failure, he would have lost his life, would he get such a great scientist, would he not get such a big president
The numbers have become the most important.
Because of this, the competition has increased greatly, as well as the tension in the students has also increased.
I would like to be aware of your views on this current direction of education and its future.
By the way, he himself has given the answer, but Chaji wants me to keep something in it.
Marks and marks-sheets have a limited use.
Nothing happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have earned.
Life goes on whether you have tried to live whatever you have to go
Is there any synergy between your mission and ambition that you have got a sense of mission
If you trust in these things, you will come after you by pressing the marks and you will never need to run behind the marks.
You will have knowledge in your life, skill work, self-confidence and will power.
You tell me that your family will have a doctor and all the family members will go to him, they are family doctor.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case, do you see the marks-sheets of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge, his journey of success.
And that is why the burden of this number sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I should say that it is not just reading.
Its use is necessary for your criterion.
I was yesterday, where I am today, it is necessary to know.
But if you focus on marks, you focus on marks, then you gradually shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area and get only marks.
So, despite being promising in the exams, sometimes they fail in life.
Cha ji, one thing has also been said in the competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Most of the successful players have a characteristic of their lives that they compete.
If we take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years continuously breaking your own record, defeating yourself every time and moving forward.
He is a very amazing journey of life because he adopted the path of competitiveness more than competition.
Friends in every sphere of life and when you are going to give a leaflet, if you were able to read two hours earlier, can you do it for three hours
From within, that energy is born automatically.
If you are better then you will be careless, you will be filled with great faith.
If you are upset about it, then you will be sad and disappointed, you will be filled with jealousy, the jealousy that will feed you, yourself and if you are equal, you will never feel the need for improvement.
Just concentrate on this thing.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
S. Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the question of mathematics.
Once you will learn to accept, the maximum problem will end.
Acceptance opens the way for solving problems.
The expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting the situation gives an opportunity to open new paths and therefore accept what is there.
You will also be free of burden.
One of our acquaintances was in the hospital due to heart attack, so before the Lok Sabha of India, Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, he was also a MP, he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not come and asked a single question about his health.
As soon as they sat and came, what is the situation there, what is the disease, there is no talk, they started quizzing and in the first two-four minutes they made such an environment light.
In a way, we go to the sick person as we fear the disease.
I would like to say to parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought that in the days of exam, give children an atmosphere of laughter and happiness
You see, the atmosphere will change.
I got a phone call of a great amazing.
They do not want to tell their name.
Listening to the phone, you will know why they don't want to tell their name
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot tell my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
I had tried to copy once in my childhood, I started preparing a lot for this thing that I tried to find out how I could copy it, because of which a lot of time was wasted.
In that time, I could bring the same number by reading as much as I spent spending my mind for copying.
And when I tried to get closer, I got caught in it and because of me, many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is correct.
These shortcut paths become the reason for copying.
So the cash never profits, To Cheat.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard many times and again that don't make a copy, don't make a copy.
I am telling you the same thing again.
And once there was a habit of cash, there would never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
If the same creativity gives you the same time on the issues of your exam, then perhaps it is not necessary to duplicate.
The self-confidence that will increase with the results of its own hard work will be amazing.
This basic assumption is wrong, the root cause of the problem is that.
If there is an integral development, then there is a life outside the books and it is very huge.
This is the time to learn to live.
Someone should say that I will complete all the examinations first, I will play later, then I will do this, then it is impossible.
Have you ever thought that when all these things are in front of you then go out for two moments and look at the sky, look at the trees and plants, lighten your minds, you see, you will again come in your rooms and your books with a freshness.
Whatever you are doing, take a break, get out and go to the kitchen, there is something of your choice, if you find a biscuit of your choice, then you should eat and enjoy a little laughter.
Even if you don't have five minutes, but you break.
You will feel that your work is becoming simple.
I don't know if everyone likes it or not, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to breathe deeply.
If you come under the open sky, go to the terrace, sit down for five minutes in a deep breath, you see, the body will be relaxed at one go and the relaxation of the body that you experience is equally relaxed.
When I hold meetings in the elections, sometimes my voice sits.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - How many hours do you sleep
I said - Why brother, are you a doctor
No-no, say - It is related to your voice that gets upset by speaking at the time of election.
If you take full sleep then only your vocal cord will get a complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleep and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the significance of these things, you see, you will benefit.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but something will say that the Prime Minister has said, now there is no need to wake up and keep sleeping.
So do not do this, otherwise your family members will be angry with me.
And if your marks-sheet comes on the day you will not see them, I will show them.
So do not do that.
And that is why I would say that the PDF for prepared and PDF for play, the Person who plays, Shines, this is a very big medicine to keep mind, intelligence and body alert.
Well, young friends, you are preparing for the exam and I am holding you in mind.
Maybe these things will work for you as well.
If you can do it, if you can't, don't do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So, as I advise your parents not to be burdened, they apply to me too.
Make the criterion a festival to cross every criterion.
There will never be a criterion, criterion.
Take this mantra forward.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among the world's 4 largest Coast Guards with all its 126 Ships and 62 aircrats.
While fulfilling this ideal phrase, the youngsters of the Coast Guard are prepared day and night in adverse conditions to secure the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in the Coast Guard in our country, women are also performing their responsibilities equally by joining the shoulders and successfully.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard should be pilots, be working as bservers, not only do they take overcraft command.
Vidya is considered to be an opportunity to worship.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color gives Basanti Chola - this is the same inspiration.
My best wishes to my countrymen on this holy festival of Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in the matter of mind, AIR is always filling new colors with its imagination.
Since last month, he has started listening to the mind in regional languages immediately after the completion of my mind.
It has got wide acceptance.
People are writing letters from far away.
The talk of mind gives me a great opportunity to join you.
Many best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
However, it will be seen in the newspapers, new people are being caught everyday, notes are being caught, raids are being carried out, good people are being caught. How is it possible

Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border on the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but this Diwali experience was something else.
125 crore countrymen, in a unique way, it dedicated to the soldiers of the Diwali army, dedicated to the security forces, its impact was expressed on the faces of every soldier.
He looked filled with feelings and not only this, the good wishes sent by the countrymen, the security forces of the country were a wonderful response.
And they sent messengers only , and they were not involved .
Someone wrote a poem, somebody made a picture, someone made a cartoon, someone made a video, that is, every house had become a post of soldiers.
The work is going on, with your contribution, the feelings of the army personnel of the country will be compiled in this book by your imagination and your confidence in the security forces of the country.
A soldier wrote to me - Prime Minister, for the soldiers, every festival of Diwali is on the outskirts of the country.
Yes, but at the time of festivals, the house is remembered
But tell the truth, this time it did not seem
It ' s not like the festival and I ' m not home .
It felt as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feeling that has emerged between the security forces and the soldiers of our country in this Diwali, should it be limited on just a few occasions
I appeal to you that we, as a society, as a nation, as a nation, be it any festival or festival or be it the atmosphere of happiness, we must remember the soldiers of our army in some form or the other.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the army's strength increases 125 million times
Some time ago, all the heads of the village had come to meet me from Jammu and Kashmir.
I had an opportunity to talk to them for a long time
He had come here with some ideas about the development of his village, he had come with some demands, but when the talk was going on, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, all these things were natural.
And these heads of the village spoke so lovingly, so openly, everything was going to touch my heart.
I urged them to go and focus on the future of these children
Today, I am glad that all these Prime Ministers from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promises made to me.
and awakened all the distant people in the village
Just a few days ago, when board exams, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the board examination.
Inclusion of students in such a large number of board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education for a bright future.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm, but I congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I ask people's suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that all suggestions came in one way.
Everyone used to say that talk more in detail on 500- and 1000 notes
By the way, on 8th November, at 8 pm, while addressing the nation, I had discussed the introduction of a Mahabhiyan to improve the country.
Even when I had put this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision.
And I also realized that in our normal life , we have to face many new difficulties .
And yet I had said that the decision is so big that it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards the normal state.
The campaign for liberation from diseases that we have been facing for 70 years cannot be easy .
I understand your difficulties very well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation.
A lot of efforts are being made to confuse you, despite this, sometimes you have understood this path of truth and you have accepted this thing of the country.
Five hundred thousand notes and such a large country, billions and billions of notes of such currency, and the entire world is watching these decisions very closely, every economist is analyzing it and evaluating it.
The entire world is watching the success of 1. 25 billion people of India by facing difficulties.
There may be question marks in the mind of the world
India has only a reverence for the 125 crore countrymen, it is believed that 1. 25 billion Indians will continue to fulfill their resolutions.
And our country will emerge as gold in every way and as a citizen of this country. Your success has also been possible due to this.
All units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends and friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of various tensions, all these people are working very peacefully, as a sacrifice of service to the nation and as an effort to make a great change.
Start in the morning, when the night will be completed, don't know, but all are
And that is because India will succeed in it, this is clearly visible
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working between such difficulties.
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they appear two steps ahead.
Someone told me that there was an accident in Khandwa
Suddenly money was needed
I was glad to know that they had reached their home and the elderly so that they could be helped in the treatment.
Such numerous stories emerge every day in TV, in media, in newspapers, in conversations.
His strength was introduced .
Today, once again, he has taken that challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion countrymen, the collective goodwill of all, will make this nation a new strength.
But the evils are so widespread that even today some people do not have the habit of evil
Still, some people feel that this money of corruption, these black money, these unaccounted money, these anonymous money, some other way of finding a way and bring it back to the system.
They are looking for a non-lawful way to save their money
Sadly , they preferred to choose a way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by confusing the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing any work with them.
But, by kindness, don't play with the lives of the poor
Don't do that the name of the poor should come to the record and afterwards when it is checked, my dear poor will soon get into trouble because of your sin.
And the Anonymous property is so harsh law, which is being implemented in it, how difficult it will come
And the government does not want our countrymen to face any difficulty
Any Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh has telephoneed me with the fight against corruption and black money through this five hundred and thousand: - Sar Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of Village Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh
It is very commendable that the notes of thousands and five hundred have been closed by you.
Similarly, a phone call has come to me from Mr. Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: Modi ji Namaste, I am talking about Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka.
I want to thank you because you said good days will come, but no one thought that you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and thousand notes, seeing all this, taught black money and a lesson to the corrupt
Every citizen of India will never have a good day
That ' s why I want to thank you heartily
Some things get to know through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm of working is also greatly increased.
It is so enjoyable, so proud that what is the wonderful potential of the common man in my country
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass through there, they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, including service, sacrifice and authenticity
But I don't know that in the discussion on tea, there is marriage too
I came to know that on 17th November in Surat, there was a marriage that took place with discussions on tea.
In Gujarat, a daughter who came to Surat in Surat had only given tea to those who came to her marriage and did not do any water, no food programme, because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage.
The Baratis also considered him so respectful
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - they have contributed in their own way against corruption and black money through their marriage.
I also bless Navparineet Bharat and Daksha and I congratulate all of you for turning the occasion of marriage into a new occasion by converting it into a great sacrifice.
Tea-worker lives and Tea-worker gets money weekly.
Now the note of 2000 rupees was found, what did they do
The women of four neighborhoods got together and the four went together and paid a note of Rs. 2000, so they did not need a small currency because the four people bought and decided that they would meet the next week, then we will take account of it.
People are searching themselves
See how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people have got the immediate benefit of this campaign
The country will get benefits in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefit
Every municipality is hardly 50 of tax .
But this time the 8th decision led everyone to submit their old notes .
In 47 urban units, a tax of about Rs. 3,500 crore was received last year.
You will be surprised to know that he has deposited Rs. 13 thousand crore in this week.
Said three-seven thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too from the front
Now the money has come four times in those municipalities, it is natural that there will be arrangements for gutters in poor habitations, arrangements for water and Anganwadi will be made.
There are several such examples in which its direct benefits are also visible .
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmers are a strong pivot of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, among the difficulties, every citizen is adjusting himself.
But I want to especially congratulate the farmers of my country today
Now I was taking the sowing data of this crop
Whether it be wheat or pulses or oilseeds or oilseeds, I had a calculation up to the 20th of November, the sowing has increased considerably in comparison to the previous year.
In the midst of difficulties, the farmer has found ways
Government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority
Even after that, there are difficulties, but I believe that the farmers who are facing all our difficulties and natural difficulties, they always stand firm and stand up at this moment.
Small traders of our country, they also employ and increase economic activity
Millions of crores of rupees have been given to such small people through the Mudra Yojana, because these small businesses, millions of people do it and pace the business of billions and millions of rupees
But because of this decision , it was natural for them to have difficulty .
But I have seen that now our small traders are also serving the customers in their own way through technology, through mobile app, through mobile bank, through credit cards, through their own methods, on the basis of trust.
And I want to tell my small business brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you also enter the digital world.
You also download the App of banks on your mobile phone
You also keep PSL machine for credit card
I invite you that you can contribute a lot in creating a cashless society, you can create a complete banking system on your business, mobile phones and today there are many ways other than the notes, so that we can run business.
There are technical routes, safe, secure and quick
I would like you to just help in making this campaign a success. No, you should also lead a change and I believe you can lead a change.
I also want to tell the ladies and gentlemen, you have been exploited
There is a salary on paper and when given in hand, then the second is
Sometimes when the salary is complete, someone stands outside, he has to pay cut and sometimes he makes this exploitation a part of his life.
With this new system, we want you to have an account in your bank and deposit your salary in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
And once the money has come to your bank account, you too dont need a big smart phone on a small mobile phone. Nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-botoway. You can also pay the money from the same mobile phone.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become partners in this scheme because after all, I have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the disadvantaged, for the disadvantaged and the disadvantaged.
Today I specially want to talk to young friends
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 population, below 35 years of age
You young and youngsters of my country, I know, my decision has come to you.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you contribute a lot to positively pursue this
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true companion
We have had a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India, an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
You're not going to talk to me so much
The older generation does not have the experience of today's world.
Perhaps the elder brother in your family will not even know and parents, uncles and maternal uncles may not even know.
You know what happens, what happens, what happens online banking, how online ticket booking happens, you know
Things are very common for you and you also use
But today, the great work that the country wants to do, our dream is cashless society.
It's fine that 100 percent cashless society is not possible.
And I want your personal help, your time, your own resolve and you will never disappoint me, I am sure because we all want to change the lives of the poorest of India.
You know, how many opportunities are today for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking
Every bank offers online facility
Wallet means e-butwa
There are many types of cards available
The ordinary featured phone can also cause cancer.
Whether it is a washerman, seller of vegetables, seller of milk, seller of newspapers, seller of tea or seller of gram, everyone can use it comfortably.
And I ' ve also stressed on making this system more simple
All the banks are engaged on this,
My young friends, even after all this, a whole generation is unaware of it.
And all of you, I know very well, are active in this great task
The kind of creative message you give on WhatsApp - slogans, poems, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and jokes - I see all these things and the creative power of our younger generation in the midst of challenges, it seems as if this is the characteristic of the land of India that the Gita was born in the battlefield.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-G, I repeat, I need your help and you, I believe that millions of youngsters of my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business
You voluntarily want to bring this cashless society out of the dilemma of these notes, a campaign to free the country from corruption, a campaign to get rid of black money, a campaign to free people from difficulties and problems - you have to lead this campaign.
Once you will teach people how to use Rupay Card, it will bless you.
If you teach these systems to the common man, he will probably get rid of all the concerns. And if all the youth of India take this task then I dont believe that it will take longer.
Within a month, we can stand within the world as a new modern India and you can do this through your mobile phones, you can do it everyday in 10 houses, you can add 10 houses to it everyday.
This country has made a big revolution
My youngsters, I once again request you to take this campaign forward with great insistence.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, has been carrying forward the cleanliness drive.
It seems that the theme of cleanliness has spread in their veins and that is why he remembered the work of cleanliness even on the birth anniversary of his father.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and he has written a line of soil, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction
Harivansh Rai Ji used to introduce himself through it.
His son, Shri Amitabh ji, who is running a mission of cleanliness, has written to me, using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Taan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My introduction
I respectfully bow down to Harivansh Rai ji
I also thank Shri Amitabh ji for this kind of involvement in the matter of mind and furthering the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts and feelings keep me continuously connected with you through your letters, on MyGov and on Narendra ModiApp.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages it is going to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, many best wishes to you all on Diwali.
Deepawali festival is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country that in 365 days, in some corner of the country, some festivals are seen.
The person from far flung places will feel that like the Indian people, this is the second name of the festival, and this is also natural.
From the Vedas till date, the festivals that have been traditional in India have been a celebration of timely changes, we have seen the courage to end the tradition of Kalabahya festivals and the changes in festivals have also been easily accepted as per the time and society's demand.
But one of these things we can clearly see that this journey of the festivals of India, its expansion, its depth, its penetration in the masses, its original mantras are connected to the society.
Efforts should be made to expand the individual and personality, to expand the scope of our limited thinking, from society to universe and through these festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have gathered in the festival in a very scientific way.
Today the whole world discusses environment.
Nature-Destruction is a matter of concern.
The festival of India has been a ritual to every child, to strengthen the tradition of nature.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody's obligations are being celebrated.
Nowadays, we celebrate a holiday on Sunday, but the older generation, the labourer, the fisherman, you must have seen that the tradition was with us for centuries to celebrate Purnima and Amavasya.
That is, the tradition of celebrating our holiday with the universe and science was developed here.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours comes with a sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message of going towards light from Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamay - darkness.
The blind shadow of the society by burning the lamp of Deepawali, the blind shadow of the individual, the blind shadow of the individual, and that is the festival of lighting by burning the lamp of Diwali.
One thing we all know very well, go to any corner of India, go to the house of Amir-Sey-Americans, go to the hut of the poor, in the festival of Diwali, cleanliness drives in every family.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The poor will have their soil utensils, so the soil utensils also clean such that it has just come to Diwali.
Diwali is also a cleanliness drive.
However, the demand of the hour is that not just cleanliness in the house, cleanliness of the entire premises, cleanliness of the entire village, we have to expand and expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the boundaries of India.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated in some form or the other in all the countries of the world.
Many governments of the world, the parliament of that place, the rulers of that place are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
They have shared that picture with the world and have done it with great pride.
And what is the picture.
16 women MPs of Singpore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian saris and these photos have been viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
He had just come to the Prime Minister of New ealand, he told me that I have to go back soon because I have to attend Diwali celebrations.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light is also becoming an inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
Invites a very big accident in an attempt to gather many firecrackers and make a big noise.
Sometimes it does not even notice what things are there in the vicinity, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, the news of the accident, the news of the fire, the news of immortality, makes big concerns.
And a problem also arises that in the days of Diwali doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their family in large numbers.
That is not just one day.
Say Govardhan Puja, say Bhai Duj, say Benefits Panchami, and take it to the light of Kartik Purnima, in a way a long period goes on.
Along with this, we also celebrate Deepawali festival and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
The festival of Chhath-Puja in the eastern region of India is a very big festival.
In a way, there is a great festival, it lasts for four days, but it has a special feature - it gives a great message to the society.
But the saying is that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the flowing sun is also worshiped.
There is a great social message in it .
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali, Chhath-Puja - this is the time to convey my best wishes to all of you, but at the same time there is more time for me, especially to thank the countrymen, to express gratitude.
Over the last few months, the incidents that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting everything for our happiness and happiness.
On my emotions, the soldiers of the army, the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work, my heart and soul remain shadowed.
And one of the same thing was done in mind that it was dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign in Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to bow down my head and say that there will be no human being of India, in whose heart there is immense love for the soldiers of the country, there is pride in the army, there is pride in the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it is going to give strength to every countryman.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, we have become so enthusiastic and a message of yours.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, businessmen, shopkeepers, politicians, players or sportspersons, there is hardly any one left who has not burnt the message for the soldiers of the country or the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed this festival in the opportunity to express gratitude to the army and why not, whether it is BSF or CRPF or IDF.
Whether it is Endo-Tibetan Police, Assam Riles, Water-Servicemen, Army, Coast Guard, I cannot speak the names of all, innumerable.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, there is a new strength in that memory too.
Efficiency increases in a message and the country has shown tax.
I am really grateful to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did through art.
Sandesh to Soldiers have achieved so many things on this washtag, in a symbolic way.
I will like to read a poem by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, this is all, because you are, this is you, I tell you today, the reason for my freedom is you, you are the people of happiness, I sleep peacefully, because I sleep peacefully, because you are on the outskirts of the mountain Ambar and the moon of India bent on you, the moon of Sheesh bowing down to you, the Mountain of India and the army of India, the same is my blessings and blessings on you.
My dear countrymen, whose mother is also full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also full of army personnel, a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Come, we hear, what the family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Soldiers Campaign launched on Deepawali is providing a lot of incentives to our younger brothers.
I'm an Army family.
My husband is also an Army officer.
Both my father and Dather-in-law have been Army Officers.
So our entire family is full of soldiers and we have many such officers on the border who are receiving such good messages and are getting a lot of incentives.
And I would like to say that their families, their wives, along with Army Officers and Soldiers are also doing a lot of sacrificial work.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are found not only on the border but on every front of their lives.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from defecation in the open.
Sikkim was the first state, now Himachal is also going to be held on 1 November.
The youth of TBP, Shri Vikas Thakur, is originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So in the village he was probably going to have a village council at that time, he reached there and was being discussed in the meeting of the village, toilets were constructed and it was found that some families were unable to make toilets due to lack of money.
This development Thakur is an integral part of our patriotism.
And that is why Himachal Pradesh's pen-execution has come to an end.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youth.
I noticed that in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no road, it is difficult to reach that village after walking on foot all day. It is also very difficult to reach such a tribal Panchayat Idmalakudi.
People never go
Nearby, in the urban areas, the students of engineering came to know that toilets have to be constructed in this village.
The students of NCC cadets, NSSCs and engineering together decided that we will build toilets.
All the goods, bricks, cement, all these things were taken by the youngsters on their shoulders and went to those forests walking on foot all day long.
Work is going on at a very fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken up this task, the entire state, I am sure that the crocosine will be free soon.
How big changes will come, the theft will also stop, the benefits of the environment, our foreign exchange will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yeah, it would be difficult, the middlemen would be, the dishonest would be.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide to all of us.
Everything should be said to the country even today, how to go, the standard sets for it.
On the basis of this standard you decide.
The need of the hour is that we will have to address the aspirations of the poorest of the country.
We have to take one step after the other to get rid of the problems.
Why should not our old thinking be anything, but society must be freed from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now schools also have toilets for girls and toilets for children.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel discrimination free India.
There is vaccination on behalf of the government, but even then millions of children are exempt from vaccination and become victims of disease.
A mission of Mission Indradhanush vaccination, which has been engaged in combating the missing children, which enables the children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, the poor mother would cook food on a wooden stove and take 400 cigarettes of smoke in her body.
Efforts are being made to provide 5 crore households free of smoke free of smoke.
Small merchants, small businessmen, sellers of vegetables, sellers of milk, sellers of barbers and moneylenders used to be so frustrated in the interest of the moneylenders.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account, is a successful campaign to get rid of the interest holders.
The beneficiary gets direct money through Aadhaar.
It is an opportunity to get rid of these middlemen in the lives of the common man.
There is a campaign in which there is no improvement and change, the path from problem to liberation is being ensured and it is happening.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain touched me too: Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, Sardar Patel is on 31st day.
And as we all know how events took place in the country after their assassination.
Sir, I wanted to tell you how we can stop the events that are unfortunate.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, History is witness to the fact that after Chanakya, the Bhagirath work of uniting the country, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel did it.
A successful effort to bring India under a flag, the great man who did such a great Bhagirath work, the great man who bowed down to that great man.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, because of his priorities of unity, because of the annoyance of many, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for the sake of unity and on the birthday of Sardar, a page of injustice, history pains us all.
But, in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of this country.
We should also avoid scattered thinking and scattered trends, save the country too.
Sardar Saheb gave us an India, the responsibility of all of us is to make the best India.
The basic mantra of unity makes the strong foundation of the best India.
The journey of Sardar Saheb's life started with the struggle of farmers.
The son of the farmer was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in bringing the freedom movement to the farmers.
Sardar Saheb's successful endeavour was to make the movement of freedom as a shield in the village, his organization was the result of strength and skill.
But Sardar Saheb was just a person of struggle, not so, he was also a person of structure.
Today sometimes many people listen to Amul's name.
Today, people from outside India and India are familiar with every product of Amul.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a divine vision that he had imagined the function of cooperative milk producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is also the festival of light in the series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev, his education and initiation is a guide not only for the entire human race, but also for the entire human race.
Service, truth and goodness, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and goodwill were the original mantra.
Be it discrimination, be it superstitions, be it evils or be it the campaign to liberate the society was in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his associate when we were on the extreme limit of its deformity, untouchables, caste and caste.
Come, let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to quit discrimination, orders us to do something against discrimination, everyones development with this mantra, who can be our guide better than Guru Nanak Dev
I salute Guru Nanak Dev, this Prakash Utsav, then I salute him.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all on this Diwali and on the occasion of Diwali.
Your dreams, your resolutions are successful in every way.
I convey my best wishes to you all for your life of happiness and happiness.
Thank you very much.
In the last few days, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why I would like to tell the countrymen the same thing today and I would like to repeat what I had said on that day that the guilty will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We despise our army.
I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir especially today.
The citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the anti-national forces well.
And as the truth has started to understand, they have separated themselves from such elements and walked on the path of peace.
Every parents wish that the school-college should work completely as soon as possible.
The farmers are also feeling that the crops and fruits that have been produced should reach the markets across the country.
Economic business also runs well.
And for the last few days the business has started running smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems, there is a way to progress and also the path of development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem together, find ways and also pave the way for the future generation of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of this government.
To make law and order, the government has to take some steps.
Occasionally people who think differently from what we think are new ideas.
In the social media these days I get a lot of opportunity to know.
Every corner of India gets an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of every kind and it promotes the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshvardhan of 11th class kept a different kind of idea in front of me.
He wrote that I was very disturbed after the Uri terrorist attack.
But there was no way to do it and what could a small student like me do
So I came to my mind that how should I work for the country's interest.
And I resolved that I will study for 3 hours a day.
The work of the country can come, it will be a worthy citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, at such a young age in this atmosphere of resentment, you can think well, this is a matter of happiness for me.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also say that the resentment in the minds of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this world of spirituality in a very good way.
And he had inspired the common man of the country by giving Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan Mantra.
Another way of expressing patriotism among the sounds of a bomb is for every citizen, it was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
Even Mahatma Gandhi, when the movement of freedom was on intensity and there was a need for a halt in the movement, he used very successfully to motivate the intensity of the movement towards constructive work within the society.
All of us - the army should take responsibility, the people sitting in the government should perform their duty. And if we make a constructive contribution with the responsibility of the countrymen, every citizen, with the responsibility of this patriotism, then the country will definitely scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shriman T. S. Karthik has written to me on NarendraModiApp that the legends that had gone to Paralympics have created history and their performance is a victory of human spirit.
Shri Varun Viswanathan also wrote on NarendraModiApp that our athletes have done a very good job and you should mention it in the matter of mind.
You two, every individual of the country has had an emotional attachment towards our players in Paralympics.
Perhaps more than sports, this Paralympics and the performance of our players have completely changed the attitude of humanity, the attitude of looking towards Divine.
And I will never forget this thing of our winning sister Deepa Malik.
When he received medal, he said this medal has defeated disability.
There is a lot of strength in this sentence.
This time in Paralympics, 19 athletes including 3 women from our country participated.
When Divyang plays compared to the rest of the sports, physical ability, sports skills, this is the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be happy to know that our players have achieved 4 medals by performing the best ever so far - 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 silver medal.
The brother who received the Gold Medal, Devendra Jhajharia-Bhala, he brought the Gold Medal again and brought it again after 12 years.
And they were not Divya from birth.
They had to lose their hands because of the electricity current.
Just imagine, the person who receives the first gold medal at the age of 23 and receives the second gold medal at the age of 35, how much he has done in his life.
Mariyappan won the gold medal in Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of just 5.
The poor also did not come against their resolve.
Neither are they living in a big city, nor are they from the middle class rich family.
Despite passing through difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, the country was given a medal with the ability to resolve.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, it has been linked with his name to hoist several kinds of Vijayaptakayas.
Varun C. Bhati got a medal in high jump.
In our country, in our society, in our society, in our neighbourhood, these medals have done a great job to look at the divine brothers and sisters of our country.
Our condolences have been awakened, but the attitude of looking at these disabled people has also changed.
Very few people will be aware of the kind of valour they have performed in the Paralympics of this time.
Just a few days ago, there was a lympics competition at the same place.
Someone can imagine that the people of Divyang also broke the record of General Lympics.
This time it happened.
Abdellati Baka of Algeria has made a new record in the race of 1. 7 seconds in a race of 1500 meters from the records made by the gold medal winner in the race of 1500 meters.
Not only this, I was surprised that the fourth number of persons with disabilities who did not get any medal as a runner was running in less time than those who received gold medal in the general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all these players and in the days to come, India is moving forward towards making a smooth plan for Paralympics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
He also told me a portion, and I presented it to the people there, so people were surprised.
On that day, I had the opportunity to dedicate a book and collected successful stories of the lives of some disabled persons.
There were big motivational incidents.
The Government of India has recorded a world record on the soil of Navsari, which I consider important.
Within eight hours, six or six persons with disabilities who could not hear, successfully used machines to edit them.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for us to have a three-world record by the Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a nature, every citizen should become a duty, an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt should be created.
Now, when two years are taking place on 2nd October, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1. 25 billion countrymen.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we all can say that everyone has tried to move forward one step.
That means that the country has moved forward towards cleanliness.
It has also been confirmed, the direction is correct, the fruits are so good, they have also been noticed by a little effort. Therefore, everybody, whether it is a common citizen, whether it is a government office or a road, whether it is a bus or a rail or a railway or a college or a religious place, whether it is a hospital or a hospital or adults, whether it is a village or a village or a poor, all the farmers are contributing something within cleanliness.
Media's friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, the efforts have been fulfilled, and we will succeed, this confidence has also arisen.
It is also necessary and only then we talk about rural India, so far, about two crore seventeen lakh toilets have been constructed and intended to construct 1. 5 crore toilets in the next one year.
I had just gone to Gujarat, then I was told by the officials that Porbandar, who is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove Porbandar a complete target on October 2.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, best wishes to those who are trying to do this thing and I urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the sake of respecting mothers and sisters, for the health of small children.
Especially I want to present a scheme for young friends who are using technology nowadays.
Everyone has the right to know what the cleanliness mission is in your city and for this the Government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know, Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
These 1969 numbers - You will not only be able to know the condition of construction of toilets in your city by phone but will also be able to apply for toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor those young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent in the form of Swachh Bharat Ellows in the districts.
This cleanliness drive is not just limited to rites.
Cleanliness becomes a habit, it is not enough.
In today's era, health is associated with cleanliness. However, revenue model is also essential with cleanliness.
Estate to health should also be a part of it. Therefore, we have to move forward towards Estate to Employment along with the cleanliness mission.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost they prepare from the waste.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming provided this to them.
Those who want to improve the health of their soil, those who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizers, if they need such fertilizers in a few quantities.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan is contributing a lot in this work as Brand Ambassador.
It's like doing this.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers, Mayors of metropolitan cities, commissioners - all these together are just and just sanitation.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All topics are going to be discussed.
And I see that there are fresh reports for cleanliness continuously.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a Jagaran campaign to construct toilets.
He himself worked and he contributed to the construction of nearly 9 thousand toilets.
In the past, you must have seen that a team led by the Ling Commander Param Vir Singh had travelled from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar, swimming 2800 kms and delivered a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a one-year calendar by its departments.
Every department focuses on cleanliness for 15 days, particularly in 15 days.
In the coming month of October from 1st to 15th October, all three of them will work together to create a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two week of the month of October, 31st October to 31st October, 3rd Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries (DAFFI).
My citizens are also requested that if you have any relation with the work done by these departments, then you should also be connected.
You must have seen that these days the surveillance campaign of cleanliness is also going on.
Earlier, once the 73 cities were surveilled and presented the status of cleanliness to the people of the country.
Now there is a turn of the 500 cities with more than 1 lakh population and due to this there is a belief in every city that let us stay behind. Now we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness.
I hope that all our citizens should contribute as much as they can in this campaign.
The next 2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is taking two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, I urge you to buy something or the other of Khadi.
This time too, I urge that every family should have something of khadi so that the poor can get the water given by Diwali.
On October 2, while it is Sunday, as a citizen, can we connect somewhere in cleanliness
2 hours and 4 hours physically add yourself to the work of cleanliness and I tell you to share a photo of the cleanliness drive that you are involved in.
If you have video then share video.
See, once again this movement will get a new momentum and new momentum with the efforts of the people across the country.
Recalling the virtue of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a joy in giving it in life and nobody should recognise it or not.
This is their campaign to bring the needy people to their food, clothes and all these things together.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and used to donate the old toys to the families and the toys that used to come from the poorest of the poor people used to offer their offerings.
This is a kind of charity festival.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to the youngsters engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji and the centenary year of his birth is beginning today.
The principle of Sarvajan Hitay-Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya - this is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the welfare of the last person.
How did the poor person get the fruit of development
He had presented the entire economic agenda in two words of water to every farm.
The country celebrates their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
The focus of the society, the governments, everyone's attention, the benefits of development should be focused on the poor and only then can we deliver the country from poverty.
He is a symbol of the poor welfare year of the same century.
Inspired by all of us, I respectfully salute Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, the wealthy devotee of our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, I had started talking about Mann Ki Baat 2 years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
I had an authentic attempt to say that this should not be a programme to praise the government's work.
How the common man of this country inspires me
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the manner in which you have admired Mann Ki Baat, the manner in which you blessed me.
I am also grateful to AIR that they not only broadcast these things to me but also made every effort to reach them in all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who after writing letters, suggestions and knocked on the doors of the government, highlighted the shortcomings of the government and AIR has provided platforms for solving problems by making special programmes on such letters.
So the matter of mind is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, it has become a new opportunity for society-change.
I express my gratitude to everyone associated with making it a success because of this great satisfaction.
My dear countrymen, next week, the festival of Navratri and Durga-Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way, the same atmosphere happens in the entire country.
This is a festival of power and prosperity, the unity of society is the power of the country.
Whether it is Navaratri or Durga-Puja, how can it be a festival of worship of Shakti, the unity of society
How did the festival connecting the people
And that is the sadhana of true power and only then can we celebrate the victory of tax together.
Come, let's do the work of power, let's take the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar is the birth anniversary of Hockey's magician Dhyan Chand Ji on August 29.
This day is celebrated throughout the country as National Sports Day.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand Ji and also wish to remind all of you of his contribution on this occasion.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in giving India the gold medal of the Hockey Hockey Hockey.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked for Dhyan Chand ji - We scores goals like runs. Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player hit the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
There was only 10 minutes left to complete the match at that time.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of the injury to the round.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk of mind, there are several suggestions on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
I am seeing it very positive for the common man to have so much attachment to Rio lympics, so much awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something about it.
Outside of cricket, there is so much love for the citizens of India and sports, there is so much awareness and there are so many information.
Reading this message for me, it also became the reason for a great inspiration in itself.
A Shriman Ajit Singh has written on NarendraModiApp: Please speak this time on the education of daughters and their participation in sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals in Rio lympics.
Some Mr. Sachin writes that you are requested to mention the Indus, Witnesses and Deepa Karmakar in this matter of mind.
The medals we received, the daughters gave.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone, in any way.
It seems as if the daughters of the whole of India have taken the initiative to illuminate the name of the country.
Shikhar Thakur has written on MyGov that we could do even better in lympics.
He has written: Honorable Modi sir, first of all, congratulations for the two medals we won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention on whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need a long journey in sports.
Our parents still stress on focusing on studies and academics.
In society, the game is still considered a waste of time.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs motivation.
And no one can do this work well with you.
Similarly, Shriman Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on NarendraModiApp that there is a need to focus on extra-curricular activities especially by taking children and youth to sports.
Thousands of people have expressed this feeling in a way.
It can not be ruled out that we can not perform according to our hope.
In some cases it happened that those players who used to perform in India, those who performed in the sports here did not even reach there and only two medals were found in the medal table.
But it is also true that even if you do not get the medal, then for the first time in many subjects, the players of India have shown a lot of good work.
Now, in Shooting, our innovative Bindra ji stayed in fourth place and he missed the medal with a very small difference.
In Gymnastic, Deepa Karmakar also earned a lot - she was in fourth place and she missed medal due to very little gap.
But how can we forget that he is the first Indian daughter to quote for lympics and for lympic finals
Something similar happened with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna in tennis.
We performed well this time in Athletics.
After PT Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar qualifies for track field finals.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years the women hockey team reached the lympics.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached outer-inal in Boing, but could not get a bronze.
Many players, for example - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performance is good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we do what we have done, then we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a commitment.
The government of India will go into its depths and study what practices are being done in the world.
We will create a roadmap for what we can do.
2020, 2024, 2028 - With a far-reaching thinking, we have to plan.
I also urge the State Governments to create such committees and showcase what we can do within the sports world, what each state can do, what state can prefer one game or two games
And I urge every citizen of India to send suggestions on NarendraModiApp to those who are interested in it.
Write to the government, discuss the association and give its memorandum to the government.
State governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers' Day.
I also learned a lot from these small children.
I also had 5th September Teachers' Day and for me, education day was also there.
But this time I have to go for the G-20 Summit so I felt that today I will express my feelings and feelings in my mind.
The mother's place in life is as much as the teacher's place.
And we have seen such teachers who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
He spends his life for his disciples, for his students.
These days after Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichand ji is discussed all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what a good teacher is.
Today I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher than a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication to sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
The contribution of the teacher in our lives is always felt.
5th September is the birthday of Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji, former President of India and the country celebrates it as Teachers' Day.
He reached any place in his life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Sometimes I think, I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our ero in our small villages.
But today I can say with happiness that one of my teachers - now they are 90 years old - even today their letter comes to me every month.
And I am surprised that even at the age of 90, he writes with such beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad. Because of this whenever I see somebody's good letters, I feel great respect in my mind.
You are on NarendraModiApp, photographing with your teacher, any incident with your teacher, any motivation of your teacher, you must share it.
See, the contribution of the teacher in the country is very valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh festival is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a disintegrator and we all want our country, our society, our family, every person and his life to remain uninterrupted.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh festival - this is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh festival, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening and made a festival of social rituals.
And, through the public Ganesh Utsav, there should be a wide range of discussions on the issues that touch society and life, the programmes should be composed so that the society gets a new energy, a new pace.
Even today, not just Maharashtra, public Ganesh festivals have started taking place in every corner of India.
All the youngsters also make a lot of preparations to do this, there is a lot of enthusiasm.
And some people have still made a lot of efforts to follow the spirit that Lokmanya Tilak ji had kept.
They hold discussions on public issues, essay competitions, colorful competitions.
They also highlight the issues that touch the society in a very artistic way.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through the public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth right.
Suraj should be our priority, can we not convey the message of this mantra to the public Ganesh festival
Come on, I invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of the society.
Festival fills a new life in the life of a person and society.
Life is impossible without festival, but it has to be shaped as per the demand of time.
This time I have seen that many people have specially written Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja on those things.
And they are worried about the environment.
Someone is Shriman Shankar Narayana Pacific, he has said with great insistence that Modi ji, in the matter of mind, explain to the people that do not use Ganesh ji's idols made of Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of village pond
POP-made images are not favorable to the environment.
They have expressed a lot of pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to you all, why not come back on the old tradition of Ganesh idols and statues of Durga by using soil.
It is also the service of God that protects the environment, protects our rivers and ponds, protects the small creatures of this water from pollution in it.
Ganesh ji is disturbed.
So we should not create such a Ganesh ji, who creates disruption.
I don't know how you will take these things.
Several such institutions, individuals work hard and propagate for the soil of Ganesh.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
There is a time between Durga Puja.
Now we should decide that the idols that our old families used to build will also get employment and the pond or river will be made from the soil, then the environment will also be protected.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred Mother Teresa on 4th September with the title of Saint.
Mother Teresa had put her whole life in India to serve the poor.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa receives the title of Saint.
On 4th September, an official delegation led by the Government of India, our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also be sent there.
We have to learn something from the saints, sages, saints, great men every moment.
We will continue to find something or the other, we will continue to learn and do something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then how big a change comes.
Janshakti is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India, in collaboration with 5 State Governments in the past, made a successful effort to connect people for clean Ganga, for cleaning Ganga.
On 20th of this month, those people were invited to Allahabad who were the heads of the villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women too.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of Ganga coast took oath in the witness of Ma Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of going to the open in their villages of Ganga coast, will run a campaign to make toilets and the village will contribute completely in Ganga Safai that the village will not allow the Ganga to be dirty.
I congratulate these Prime Ministers for coming to Allahabad for this resolution, someone from Uttarakhand, someone from Uttar Pradesh, someone from Bihar, someone from Jharkhand, someone from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India, those Ministers who realized this imagination.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the 5 states that they have taken an important step in the eradication of the Ganga by adding manpower.
My dear countrymen, sometimes things touch me very much and I have a special respect for those who imagine it.
On July 15, more than seventeen to hundred schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children of seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it had so much effect that after receiving the letter, when the school came to power on the second day, the parents caught him with a letter to the teacher and the parents had promised that he would make toilets by the date of the dawn.
Congratulations to those who made this effort and also congratulated those students and their parents who decided to take the letter of their children seriously and make them toilets.
This is what inspires us.
Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen years old in Koppal district of Karnataka, has done satyagraha against her family.
They say that they had left their food and that too was not for asking for anything for themselves, not for bringing good clothes, not for eating sweets, but for daughter Mallamma that there should be toilet in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, the daughter was stuck on jid, she was not ready to leave her satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had done a satyagraha for toilet, then see the specialty of the village's head Mohammad Shafi that he spent eighteen thousand rupees and made a toilet within a week.
Look at the strength of this daughter Mallamma's life and look at the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
This is the manpower that opens the doors to solve the problems.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become resolved.
Some Indians have made it their constituency.
But everyone is associated with it in some form, everyone is contributing.
His competition will be and the reward will be given to those who will be victorious on the 2nd of October Gandhi Jayanti.
Hey, nowadays you can make a film with your mobile phone America.
Come on, go ahead, you are my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to deepen our relations with our neighbours, our relations should be comfortable and our relations should be alive.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President Hon'ble Pranab Mukherjee launched a new program in Kolkata, AIR Friendship Channel.
Now many people will feel that the President should also inaugurate a Radio channel.
But this is not the channel of common radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
They will share content and enjoy the English-speaking people on both sides.
People to People's Contact contributes a lot to All India Radio.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for their involvement with us for this work.
I also congratulate AIR friends for giving their contribution in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the work of the Prime Minister, but I am also a person like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me more.
Such emotional events also give new energy, new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of India to do something or the other.
In the past, I got such a letter, touched my mind.
A 84-year-old mother, a retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
If he had not forbidden me to declare my name in his letter, I had a feeling that today I should talk to you by giving him his name and he wrote that when you had appealed to leave the Gas Subsidy, I had left the Gas Subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
The letter of the Prime Minister of India for me is not less than a Padma Shri.
Dear countrymen, you will be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those people who left the Gas Subsidy and to give a letter to them.
My effort is to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter came to this mother and he wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of the stove and that is why I am a retired teacher and in a few years my age will be 90 years and I am sending you a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that you put such poor mothers in the work to get rid of the stove smoke.
You can imagine that as a common teacher, the mother who passes on the retired pension, when you give 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers and sisters to get rid of the smoke of stove and to give gas connection.
The question is not about Rs. 50 thousand, the question is of the spirit of that mother and such daughters are their blessings, which makes me confident and strong for the future of my country.
And he didn't even write me a letter as Prime Minister.
I salute that mother and also salute these daughters and daughters of India who have been suffering from hardships and always do some good to somebody.
My dear countrymen, we were disturbed due to famine last year, but this month of August was constantly filled with the difficulties of floods.
There were frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the units of the Local Swaraj Institutions, social institutions, citizens have made every effort to do as much as they can.
However, among the news of these floods, there were some news that needed to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, let's go together, how big can we get
This will be remembered for the month of August this year.
In August 2016, a large number of parties, all the parties, all the parties together, did not give up a single chance against each other, and almost 90 parties in the entire country, in the Parliament, all the parties together passed the GST law.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And this is an example of how big work is done by all the parties in one direction.
In the same way, whatever happened in Kashmir, in relation to the situation of Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together talked about Kashmir with one voice.
He also conveyed the message to the world, conveyed the message to the separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And we all believe that everybody in Kashmir, whether it belongs to a young man or a security personnel, it is ours, it is ours, it belongs to ourselves, it belongs to our country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, we all have the responsibility to give greater emphasis on unity, expose more and more and then the country can make a bright future.
I believe in the power of 1. 25 billion countrymen.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi this morning and I believe that in the days to come, the color of sports in the entire country will give the color of zeal to every young man.
We all know that in a few days the world's largest games are going to be Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to repeat our ears.
Our hopes and aspirations are abundant, but the work of encouraging and encouraging those players in Rio is also of 1. 25 billion countrymen.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India organized a very good event in Run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Khilo.
We should also do something or the other to encourage our players in the days to come.
Whatever is the hobby of eating, everything has to be left.
I am ready to do this work on your behalf.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready to become a postman to deliver your message to these players.
If there are no research and innovation, then as the stagnant water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to live in the world without research and innovation, then we will be able to turn into a changing era and therefore the government has taken several steps to attract science to the new generation, research and innovation towards technology.
And that's why I say - Let us aim to innovate and when I say let us aim to innovate, then my AIDS cannot afford it.
If we want to prepare new generation innovators then our children will have to join them and therefore the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever schools will have such tinkering ab establishment, they will be given Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs will be provided for maintenance during five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous Incubation Centre, then there is a system for innovation, start-ups, to bring it to a position.
Similarly, India is battling many problems.
We see problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technology solutions.
We have called upon an Atal Grand Challenge to the younger generation of the country to find ways of technology, research, innovation and bring solutions.
The Government of India wants to promote the technology discovered to solve our problems by giving special prizes.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worried about famine and these days rain is also enjoying rain, the news of floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are making a lot of efforts by joining shoulders to assist the flood victims.
Even if there is some difficulty due to rains, every human mind gets frozen because there is rain and cultivation in the center of our entire economic activity.
Sometimes such a disease comes that we regret for life.
Engue can be avoided.
Keep in mind a little hygiene, be cautious and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children and this is not the case of engagement in the poorest of the poor.
Engue comes first in a happy and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen advertisements on IT but sometimes we remain indifferent to awareness on it.
The government, hospitals, doctors - they will do their jobs, but we should not enter our houses, our territories, our families and be cautious about the diseases caused by water.
My dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention to another problem.
Life has become so turbulent, it has become so racing that sometimes we dont have time to think for ourselves.
If you are sick, then you feel that you will recover quickly and that's why someone puts antibiotics in the body.
Immediately the disease gets rid of it, but my dear countrymen, the habits of taking antibiotics on these routes can create a very serious problem.
Maybe you can get relief for a few moments, but without the advice of doctors, we should stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course of the day the doctor has asked for.
The bacteria that spread TB and Malaria are bringing such changes in themselves at a fast pace that medicines have no effect.
In medical language it is called antibiotic resistance and therefore it is equally important to follow the rules of antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
The concern of the lives of the mothers in our country is sometimes very sad.
About 3 crore women in our country take pregnancy every year, but some mothers die during pregnancy, sometimes the mother dies, sometimes the child dies, sometimes both the child and the mother die.
It is fine that in the last decade, there has been a decrease in the rate of untimely death of the mother, but still a large number of pregnant mothers can not save their lives.
During or after pregnancy, blood deficiency, delivery infection, high BP - When does not know which problem destroy his life
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be checked free of cost in government health centers.
The lives of both mother and child can be saved and I specially told the gynecologist if you cannot provide these services free of cost for poor mothers on 9th of a month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not spend twelve days in a year for the poor
I believe you will definitely join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world - Climate Change, Global Warming and Environment - is very concerned about it.
It is collectively discussed in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Lord Krishna also discusses the tree in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, worrying about the tree in the battlefield also means that we can guess how much its importance will be.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says - Ashwattha: I am a peepal in all the trees.
Venus policy says - Nasti original Anushadhan - There is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates, gives it a wire in the world like a tree child.
Therefore, parents wishing for their welfare plant good trees and follow them like their children.
Whether it is our scripture, the policy of thanksgiving or the discipline of the Mahabharata, there are some people in today's generation who live up to these ideals.
A few days ago, an example of Pune's daughter Sonal came to my attention, he touched my mind.
In the Disciplinary Festival of the Mahabharata, it is said that the tree fulfills the responsibility of the child even in the Parlok. Sonal has taken the initiative of fulfilling the wishes of the society, not just his parents.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, married his granddaughter Sonal in a big motivational way.
Such a scene that touched the mind was in that picture.
This idea came to him and presented a mango plant at the wedding, see how good the love of nature appeared.
In a way Sonal's marriage became an immortal legend of nature and I extend my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatre ji for this innovative endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there used to be a large number of pilgrims visiting the temple of Ambaji in the month of Bhadra, once a social worker organisation decided that those who visited the temple will plant them in Prasad and they will ask them to see that this is the prasad of Mata ji.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we ruin our land by fenced our fields, why not we cultivate timber in the place of that fence.
Today, India has to bring billions of trillions of trillions of trillions from abroad to build houses and urniture.
If we plant such trees on the edge of our farms, which are used for urinary and houses, then after fifteen-twenty years we can sell it by cutting it off from the permission of the government. You and that can also become a new source of income for you and you can also avoid importing timber.
In the past, many states have launched a lot of campaign using this season, the Indian government has passed an AMPA law just now, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to go for plantation.
I have been told that the Government of Maharashtra has planted nearly two crore plants in the entire state on July 1, and next year they have pledged to plant three crore plants.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, the desert - has done such a big forest festival and has pledged to plant twenty five lakh plants.
Twenty-five lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big accomplishments they have taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green coverage by 2029.
There is also a very bright tradition of the One Festival in Gujarat.
This year, Gujarat has taken up many such projects as Amra Forest, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest as a One Festival and has launched a campaign to plant millions of trees.
I am unable to mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and when there is a foreign travel, then there is a diplomacy, trade, discussions about security, many motivations, all this has to happen.
But for me the journey of South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela when they remember South Africa.
When non-violence, love, forgiveness in the world - these words fall on the ears, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces appear before us.
During my visit to South Africa, I had gone to the Phoeni Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit the train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled in the train and the train that had laid the foundation stone for making Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to tell you, I got the opportunity to meet such great personalities who had spent their youth for equality and equal opportunity for the society.
He had fought with Nelson Mandela on his shoulder and fought for the war. He had spent twenty-two years in prisons with Nelson Mandela.
In a way, he had sacrificed his full strength and I was fortunate to see these great personalities, Shriman Ahmed Kathara, close associate of Nelson Mandela, Shri Laloo Chiba, Shriman George Bezos, Ronnie Kasrills.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they were ready to live for those who lived.
Even after doing such a great penance on their faces, it was not visible anywhere.
A kind of duties - the symptoms of duty in the Gita and not the symptoms of the duties, they appeared to be absolutely literate.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no bigger mantra for any society and government.
Equality and greed, these are the ways, which lead us towards a bright future.
Want a good future for children.
The priority will be different, but the path is the same and that is the path of development, equality, equal opportunity, equality, feelings and feelings.
Let us take pride in our Indians who have shown the basic mantras of our lives even in South Africa.
Being a woman, I'm very sorry for her family.
And as technology is doing a big role in the economic system, those who misuse it also come to the ground.
You might be confused sometimes and they write a letter to you so well, as it seems, it is the right letter.
Any leaflet makes a letter pad, your credit card number, debit card number and your account becomes empty through technology.
This is a new fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I think that we should avoid this joy, stay alert and if there are such false things then we should share our friends and make them a little aware.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought good things in my mind and you must have experienced it all, but perhaps you might not have seen it as seriously, but I think there is a need to see it.
My dear countrymen, if the Parliament session is going on these days then I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country during the session of Parliament.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students of Aligarh came to me.
Artificial paintings have been done at the station.
Moreover, the plastic bottles or coil cannons that were lying in the village were discovered and collected by them and planted them with soil and planted them and made them virtual guardians.
And by making this virtual garden in plastic bottles towards the railway station, it was completely renewed.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you must see the station.
Nowadays, these reports are coming to me from several railway stations in India and local people are presenting their area on the walls of the railway station through their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of how a change can be brought about by public participation.
Congratulations to all those working in this way in the country, special felicitations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with you, there are festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in temples, worship houses and you will also be associated with the festival outside the house.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a special festival of importance here.
Like last year, can not you offer Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Think, give a gift to the sister, who will really protect her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal, can create an opportunity to do something for the country.
The whole country should be colored with the color of the freedom fighters and once again feel the joy of freedom all around.
This environment should be made by all of us and the festival of freedom - this is not a government programme, it should be for the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope that you too will do something good with the inspiration of patriotism.
Send his picture to the NarendraModi App.
Make an environment in the country.
Dear countrymen, on 15th August, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I get a privilege of talking to the nation.
There will be some things in your mind, which you would like to keep your point as intensely from the Red Fort.
I invite you, the thoughts that come in your mind, which feel that as your representative, as your Prime Servant, I must tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write and send me.
Whatever is spoken from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of hundred and fifty million people.
I invite you, let us remember the virtues of the freedom fighters, remember the great men who spent their lives for India and proceed ahead with the pledge to do something for the country.
Many greetings to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I am also grateful to AIR because he has made a successful effort to present this mind in regional languages at 8.00 in the evening.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later convey their feelings to me through letters, telephones, through MyGov website, Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
My interaction with you people is very useful for this thing that how much the government should be active in terms of public interest, how much the work of public interest should be.
I hope that by becoming more active, you will certainly emphasize on how democracy can be run with public participation.
The heat is increasing.
Nearly the maximum part of the country is experiencing the fierce fire of heat.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, the trees were cut and in a way the human race destroyed nature and paved the way for its destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions and concerns for the environment all over the world.
This time, United Nations has kept this topic on World Environment Day for Fero Tolerance for Film Film Film Trade.
It will have to be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, we have to discuss water and how our forests should grow.
Because you must have seen that in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir-Himalaya in the past, there was a fire in the forests.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - Although there has been a tradition like the government, I could do a meeting of all drought-affected states, but I did not do it.
What states have to say, listen to them closely.
Generally, in the government, how much money has been spent from the Government of India and how many expenses have been spent - it does not matter much closer.
It was also surprising for the officials of our Government of India that many states have made excellent efforts regarding water, regarding the environment, to deal with the situation of drought, to deal with the animals, to the affected persons and in a way to every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, it was felt that there was a focus on this problem, on the long-term situation, on what permanent solutions should be to deal with.
In a way, it was also a learning experience for me and I have asked my NITI Aayog to work on how to take the best practices in all the states.
Some states, particularly Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat has made a lot of use of technology.
I would like to further bring the special successful efforts of the States through the NITI Aayog to us and the States.
Public participation is the basis of a great success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give some offerings and even a little prasad falls, there is anger in the mind.
Take him up and apologize to God five times.
This water is also the offering of God.
If a drop is also ruined, then we should suffer.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important and water irrigation is equally important. Therefore, per drop-more crops, micro-irrigation, minimum water crops.
Now it is a matter of happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, someone is using drip-irrigation, someone is doing sprinklers.
Some states have successfully used drip-irrigation for paddy and rice cultivation and due to this their yields also increased, water was also saved and wages were also reduced.
When I heard from these states, there are several states which have taken very big targets, particularly Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a great job in drip-irrigation and their efforts are to add 2-3 lakh hectares each year to micro-irrigation.
If this campaign was run in all the states then farming would also benefit a lot and water would also be accumulated.
Our brothers of Telangana have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna river very well through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology and ground water recharge in the Neeru Progress Mission.
In the mass movement created by Maharashtra, people are also sweating and giving money.
I really feel that this movement will be of great help to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh Balram Pond Scheme - nearly 22 thousand ponds are not small data
Rajasthan and Gujarat have launched a big campaign to revive them as water temples where there are more older times.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister's Water Supply Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is water problem.
He has launched a massive campaign of heck am.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have campaigned in the direction of preventing ten to ten, twenty-two kilometers of water by making small obstacles in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - we decide, even a single drop of water will not be wasted.
And this is not just a matter of farmers
This is a matter related to the villages, the poor, the laborers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the rich and the poor. Therefore, if the rainy season is coming, the water should be our priority. And this time when we celebrate Diwali, we should also enjoy how much water we saved and how much water we saved.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
What a precious treasure is the gift of God
Media gave a detailed account of the problem of water in the past.
I hope that Media should guide people towards saving water, run a campaign and become a participant for the everlasting release of water crisis. I also invite them.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to make a transparent India.
If we have to bring a lot of systems from one corner to the other corner of India, then our old habits will have to change a bit.
Today, I want to touch a topic that if you help me, we can successfully move forward in that direction.
If you want salt, then give so much vegetable in return.
Business used to run from the barter system itself.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards cashless society.
We can also get the money and the money through the electronic technology system.
You can buy things, you can also square the bill.
And this will never raise the question of the theft of one of the pockets.
There will be no concern about keeping accounts and automatic accounts.
The beginning will seem to be a bit difficult, but once it gets a habit, then this system will become simple.
And this is the possibilities that we have launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana these days, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country have been opened.
We can move forward towards this cashless society while coordinating with Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM), JAM.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given with Jan-han account.
In the coming days, this card is going to be used in terms of credit and debit.
There is no need to remove money from the pocket, count it.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever the initiatives taken by the Government of India, how to make payment through a PSU, how to get the money
It will be very easy to maney transactions through your mobile phone and it is heartening that N.P.I.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your door.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and put a habit then we will not need this currencies, notes will not be required, money will not be required, business will run automatically and this will lead to a transparency.
See, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who thought that so many mobile phones would be in our hands.
Gradually became a habit, now he can not live without it.
It may be that the cashless society also takes the same form but it will be better if it is in less time.
My dear countrymen, whenever there are games of lympics and when the games start, then we sit in the headball, how many we were left behind in the gold medal, we did not get the silver mill, we didn't run from the bronze, this remains.
Encouraging and encouraging our players going for Rio lympics, everyone in their own way.
Writing a song, creating a cartoon, conveying some good wishes, encouraging some game, but the entire country should create a very positive atmosphere towards these players.
The result will come - will come.
It becomes a great strength in itself when the player feels that 125 crore Indians are standing with him, he becomes very proud.
The suggestions that I have received from all over the country, and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of Hotball has started to appear in the entire country.
Many people are making their own teams by taking initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Maybe many people will not play, but thousands of lakhs of youngsters of the country are so interested in the game, it was a pleasant experience for me.
We know the attachment of cricket and India, but I have seen that this attachment to Hotball also indicates a very happy future in itself.
So, for Rio lympics, we have created an atmosphere of excitement and enthusiasm for all our players in the coming days.
Everything should not be done by the test of victory and defeat.
India has made its identity in the world with the sportsman spirit.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something in creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and enthusiasm for our sportspersons.
Over the last eight-ten days, new results are coming from somewhere or the other.
I am talking about those students who worked hard for the year, gave them exams, 10th, 12th, one after another results have started to come.
It is clear that our daughters are showing valour.
It's a matter of happiness.
My best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
I would like to once again tell those who have not succeeded that there is a lot to do in life.
If there is no result according to our wish, then no life is stuck.
We should live with confidence, we should move forward with confidence.
But a big new kind of question has come to me and I had never thought about this.
But I was surprised that everybody in the house told me this thing, hey man, four marks used to come more, you would have 90 percent.
I mean, my family and my friend, my teacher - no one was happy with my 89.33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, man, you had 90 percents for four marks.
Now I cannot understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this all in life
Wasn't that good what I did
Did I also fall short
I do not know, I have a burden on my mind.
Gaurav, I have read your letter very carefully and I feel that perhaps this pain will not only be of you but of millions and millions of students like you because it has become an environment that finds dissatisfaction with it rather than satisfaction with what has happened. This is another form of negativeness.
By finding dissatisfaction from everything, we can never take society towards satisfaction.
It would have been better if your family, your friends and friends had appreciated your 89.33 per cent then you would have decided to do more by yourself.
He has written to me Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, almost like this.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I don't remember the poem completely, but I had read it a long time ago, a poet had written that I made a picture of pain on the anvas of life.
I wish that any single audience would have shed tears on the picture of my pain.
This was the words of poetry, I do not remember it anymore, but if there is a poem a long time ago, but this was the feeling.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will say so much to you that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, keep listening, but keep on talking about yourself and keep trying to do something better.
But if you do not satisfy what you have got, then you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of great success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success does not make the ladder of success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
But I want to say this thing more than the neighbours and parents and companions that please do not impose your expectations on them by pleasing with your children.
Friends, Does life ever fail
Whoever cannot bring good marks in the exam, he goes a long way in the sports, goes ahead in music, goes ahead in the artwork, goes ahead in the business.
God has given a wonderful mode to everyone.
Just recognise your inner strength, stress on it, you will go ahead.
And this happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santoor.
There was a time when the santoor instrument was connected with the Dolk Music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who touched him and today made an important instrument of the world.
The clarinet - clarinet was in a limited place in the entire area of our music.
Most of the princes and princes used to have their place in the gate.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan touched the clarinet, today the world has become the best instrument, it has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on the health of our poor families also imbalances the tracks of life.
And it is true that the cost of not being sick is very low, but after being sick, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life, so that there is no financial burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for saving cleanliness from the disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can do cleanliness.
And the second for which I constantly urge you is Yoga.
Some people call him Yoga too.
21 June is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction for yoga throughout the world, there is a reverence and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have an invaluable gift to us, which we have given to the world.
Yoga gives the strength to live a balanced life to the world suffering from tension.
Preventiveness is better than curfe. Being healthy, balanced in the life of a person associated with Yoga, being rich in strong will, living a life full of unbelief, concentration in every work these are easy achievements.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just an event, it should be expanded, its place in the lives of every individual, every person should spend 20 minutes, 25 minutes and 30 minutes in his daily routine.
And for this 21 June Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes the collective environment becomes the cause of a change in the life of a person.
See that, get it done in your village, get it done in your locality, get it done in your city, in your school, in institution, even in Even offices.
Start a month from now, see, you will become a partner on June 21.
I have read several times that if yoga and pranayama are collective in many offices in the morning, the efficiency of the entire office increases so much, the cultivation of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
I urge you not to stay behind anywhere.
Your health is very important to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I am constantly connected with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Dear countrymen, greet you all again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Namaste
Mann Ki Baat, April 2016
Please change this condition. Ravi ji has expressed great anger but I believe that perhaps he is not angry with me, he is angry with the situation.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that print only positive news on the first page of the newspaper, he used to say this thing continuously. A few days ago, a newspaper had written to me. He had said that we have decided that on Monday we will not give a single negative news, positive news.
This time too I have seen that many letters, comments, phone calls have been received. There are many stories, suggestions, inspiration. Everyone wants to do something or the other.
You will remember the last time I had talked about a book on the stories of Premchand ji and we had decided to share something with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was seeing a large number of people shared information on a variety of books
I am glad that people are discussing and discussing books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, lifestyle and many such topics.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many more books
But one thing I have to admit is that I can ' t give time to read too much books .
But there is a need to get an opportunity to know about many books if you write and write.
But with this experience of the last one month, I feel that we have to carry it forward.
Why shouldn't we make a permanent box corner on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read a new book, write about it, discuss it and you can suggest a good name for our box corners.
Friends, It seems that when I had touched this point in the matter of water conservation, but perhaps today I am feeling that water conservation was a matter of touching your heart even before I said it was a favorite topic of the common man.
And I feel that the hearts of India have shaken these days about water .
Several scholarly and effective efforts are being made across the country regarding water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods
Media has started several innovative campaigns on water conservation
The government, the NGOs are doing something or the other at the war level.
Looking at the power of collectivity, the mind feels very good and is very satisfied.
Villagers donate labour and give a definite direction to the waterfall flowing from the mountain
That too pure indigenous method
This has not only stopped the soil erosion and the waste of the crop, but the fields are also getting water.
You will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to prepare its water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, the cultivation of crops is being promoted, which require less water and there is no harm to the farmers.
I would particularly like to congratulate the Haryana Government for interacting with the farmers and motivating them for low-water crops, apart from traditional farming.
Now is the time for festivals .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
Every section of the society reaches fairs .
We can deliver the message of water conservation in these fairs very effectively, exhibit exhibitions, street plays, festivals as well as message of water conservation.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm and especially the achievements of the children, their exploitations give us new energy and that is why today I want to talk about some children and these children are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronish Ganguly and Ala-Manda.
You will also be filled with pride and zeal by what I will tell about them.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world
It seems that death is standing at the gate, but all these ten children have defeated not only cancer, cancer-like deadly diseases, but have illuminated India's name all over the world in their exploitation.
In sports, we often see that the players become champions after winning tournaments or winning the medal, but this was a rare opportunity, where these people were champions before participating in the sports competition and they too were champions of the war of life.
In fact, World Childrens winners games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a unique sports tournament in which young cancer survivors who have emerged from cancer in their lives take part.
Competitions like Shooting, Hess, Swimming, Running, Hotball and Table Tennis were organised in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won the medal in this tournament.
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists, in March, had launched A-Sat and after that there was not much discussion of big and important news like A-Sat in the emergence of the Chandrayaan-2 elections.
While we achieved the ability to kill Satellite, three to hundred kilometers away from the A-Sat missile in just three minutes.
India, the world, the fourth country to achieve this achievement and now, on 22nd July, the entire country, with pride, saw how Chandrayaan-Two moved towards space from Sriharikota.
Photos of the launch of Chandrayaan-Two filled the countrymen with pride and zeal, happiness
Chandrayaan-two, this mission is special in many ways
Chandrayaan-two will further clarify our understanding of the moon
This will enable us to get more information about the moon in detail but if you ask me what two big lessons I got from the Chandrayaan-Two, then I will say, these two lessons are Faith and Wearlessness.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be glad to know that the handryan-two is completely Indian-colored.
This is Indian with Heart and Spirit
is completely an indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when it comes to doing something new in the new sector, it will be possible to do something new.
Just as our scientists, in record time, day and night, corrected all the technical issues and launched the handryan-two, it is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
We all should be proud of it , and in spite of interruption , they have not changed their time .
We have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that we have the ability to overcome it.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the students of the country, with the young friends, about competition and invite young women from the country.
I request young friends, students to participate in this ui Competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with their stake.
I urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious
For these victorious students, there will be a historic event in their lives, but for this you have to take part in the ui Competition, get the highest marks, you have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our minds have given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired the mind.
Five years ago, the journey started today is setting new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in cleanliness, but the way the cleanliness campaign has been successful in public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 1.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty
Just a few days ago I was watching the story of Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in Media
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but beautiful some time ago
He started with Lodhi Garden dustbins with his team
Through the street art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the ver Bridge and the school to the slums, when they began to swing their skills, the people also got together and in a way this process started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh
There is no voice in the colors and lines, but the indradhanush made from these pictures proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making waste from waste.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This event belonged to Mohammad Aslam, brother of Shopian of Jammu and Kashmir.
He likes to hear the talk of mind
I am happy to state that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in June
I think such programmes should be organized every three months
At the same time, the programme should also have online monitoring arrangements.
In my view, this was the first such program of its kind, in which the public spoke directly to the government.
Brother Mohammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it my curiosity to know about the Back to Village Programme increased and when I got to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also know about it.
This program shows how enthusiastic the people of Kashmir are desperate to join the mainstream of development
In this programme, for the first time, the officers who had never been seen directly from the villages, themselves came to their doors to understand the obstacles in the work of development and solve the problems.
The programme covered a week and in almost four and a half thousand panchayats of the state government officials gave detailed information about government schemes and programmes to the villagers.
How can Panchayats be further strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of ordinary human beings  The villagers also openly told their problems .
Friends, this programme was not a government feedback that the officers returned after roaming around the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat. This gave them an opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other things were also included to make this program interesting
Sports Competition for Children under Khelo India
The same Sports Kits, MNREGA job cards and SST fertilizers were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir became openly involved in this festival of development
It is a matter of happiness that the Back to Village programme was also organised in remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one day and a half to climb the hills through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their welcome that they stayed in the villages for more than two days .
It is very pleasant to organize Gram Sabhas in these areas, participate in a large number of people and prepare plans for themselves.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, awarded the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of the month of Sawan in one of his poems as follows:
People from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Sawan in their own way throughout India.
Whenever We look around us in this weather , it appears as if the earth had covered a green sheet .
All around, a new energy starts getting transmitted
In this holy month, many pilgrims visit Kanvad and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this time, the symbol of the love of brother and sister also comes to the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
You will be happy to know that this time most pilgrims have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
Since July 1 till now more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave .
More than the number of pilgrims who had joined this journey for 60 days in 2015, this time they have joined in just 28 days.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I would like to especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who return from the journey are convinced of the warmth and spirit of the people of the state.
All these things are going to be very useful for tourism in the future .
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half since the Chardham Yatra has started in Uttarakhand this year.
After the horrific disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty is visible during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and travel cannot be a teacher bigger than that.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Sawan will communicate with you new energy, new hope and new hopes.
So leave India in the month of August with the memory of it .
I would like you to make some special preparations on 15th August to seek a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
On the other hand, this is the time when there is heavy rains in many parts of the country.
By the way, when we see TV, the only aspect of the rain looks flooded, flooded water, traffic jam
The second picture of the monsoon, in which our farmers, shining birds, flowing waterfalls, greenery covered land, you have to go out with your own family to see this.
Both rain, freshness and happiness brings together my best wishes that this monsoon continues to fill you with happiness.
My dear countrymen, many greetings to you all
Today, people of Christian community are celebrating Easter across the world.
I convey my best wishes to all the people on Easter.
And for some people there will be a criterion because on the one hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, the T-20 ricket world up will be waiting for the match of India and Australia.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A good momentum is visible.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I convey my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
65 percent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports.
Time is a new revolution in sports.
24 teams of the world are coming to play in India.
India won the Gold Medal in 1951, 1962 Asian Games and India was ranked fourth in 1956 Lympic Games.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we walked on the lower foot, went back, fell and fell.
Cootball is an opportunity. Can you give me your suggestion
I consider a huge opportunity to brand India globally.
I consider the opportunity to identify the youth power of India and not the meaning of what was found in the middle of Match.
By preparing for this host, we can decorate our power, express our strength and we can also brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on this, NarendraModiApp
My dear students, you must have thought of tourism during the holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time too, I had urged you people to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, language, eating and drinking do not know what to see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you go out to see, you will watch for a lifetime, you will watch
I am fortunate that I have got a lot of opportunity to visit.
When the Chief Minister was not there, the Prime Minister was not there and you were as young as you, I traveled a lot.
I think it's a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope that when you visit these holidays, can you contribute in cleanliness
Maybe it's not happening very scientifically but it's happening.
Can you also emphasize on cleanliness on tourist destinations as a tourist
I believe my youngsters will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism as compared to the world.
But we should decide that if we have to emphasize our tourism then we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the world's tourism to us and provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of young people of our country.
Whether it is government, institutions, societies, citizens, we all have to do this together.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, I don't like the holidays to come in the same way.
You also think in this direction.
Would you let your holidays, the important years of life and its important time go like this
I have an idea to think of you.
Can you make a pledge to add a new thing to your personality in holidays
If you don't swim, you can make a pledge on holidays, I can learn to swim, I don't have to drive a cycle.
Even today, I type the computer with two fingers, so will I learn typing
How many skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why shouldn't we plead in our powers
Just imagine that there should be a big clases in it, there should be no trainer, very big essence, it should not be a big budget.
You should also assume that I will make best of waste.
Look at something and start making from it.
Prime Minister, you said during the last summer holidays that the birds also get heat, so we should keep water in a utensil and keep it in our balcony or roof, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I enjoyed it, on this pretext I became friends with a lot of birds.
I request you to repeat this work back in the matter of mind.
And I didn't think that today I will say something on this subject but that Abhi had reminded me that last year I was in the pottery outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi, a child.
He called me and remembered a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friend.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved those birds very much.
He wrote in his poem - will not let you go away, will fill the courtyard with donations and fill the hod, we will fill the sweet and sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi Ji.
I congratulate Abhi and also express my gratitude that you have remembered me very importantly.
Shilpa Kuke from Mysore, he has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
They have said that those who sell milk near our house, those who sell newspapers, postman come.
Sometimes those who sell a utensil pass through there, those who sell clothes pass through.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer days
Have we ever watered it
Shilpa, I am extremely grateful to you, you have put a very sensitive topic in a very simple manner.
It is true that this thing is small but if the postman came to the house in the middle of the summer then he would like to drink water.
Well, this is the nature in India.
But Shilpa I am grateful that you observed these things.
What is the situation of the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the period of good crop these days, what are the medicines suitable
Moreover, there is a button that connects you directly with agricultural scientists and connects you with experts.
If you put any of your questions in front of him then he answers, explains, explains to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters should download this farmer's facility App on their mobile phones.
Does your work come out of it
And still if you feel some shortage then you should also complain to me.
But we also have to think about what will happen without water
Whether it is our ponds, the way water flows in our ponds, the way water flows in the ponds, where waste and waste or some other waste, water stops coming and due to this the water conservation is slowly decreasing.
Can we prepare those old places for more water conservation by digging them once again
If the water is saved in the first rain, if the water is saved, the ponds are filled, if our rivers are filled with drains, then the rain becomes rough then our loss is reduced.
This time you must have seen that 5 lakh ponds and fields have been constructed.
MNREGA has also emphasized on creating essays for water conservation.
There will be many such villages in the country, many such progressive farmers will be there, many such aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more fertilizers has made our mother sick and we are the sons of Mother Earth. How can we see our mother Earth sick
This fertilizer is similar, however good fertilizer, but if we use more and more fertilizers then it will become a cause of waste.
The more the water will be saved the more the farmer will benefit, the more life will be saved.
My dear countrymen, there is a World Health Day on 7th April and this time the world has focused on beat iabetes on this theme.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes enters, a lot of illnesses followed by the Kurupi guests enter their homes and their bodies.
It is said that in 2014, there were about six crorediabetes in India.
The reason for 3 percent deaths is that diabetes was found.
And there are two types of diabetes having a Type-1, Type-2. Type-1 dynasty, hypereditary or parents, so the child gets it.
And due to Type-2 habits, due to age, due to obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, so 7 stars have been kept in World Health Day.
We all know that our life style is the biggest reason for that.
Body labor is decreasing.
The name of sweat is not O-Nishan, it is not going to happen.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from the 7th
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we do not hesitate to make medical checkups.
And then, after a very bad situation, it comes to mind that yes, I had a very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was small, I used to be scared when I heard the name of TB.
But there is a lot of TB patients compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that which can be checked soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this direction.
You check once.
And this disease can go.
Just get the right treatment and the treatment continues till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat it whether it is TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But this is not done by the government, the doctor, the medicine unless you do it.
And that is why today I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important occasions are coming in the month of April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Bhimrao Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate that on 14th April this year, I am fortunate to visit Baba Sahib Ambedkar's birthplace.
Baba Sahib has given us a lot to become an excellent citizen.
By walking on that path as a great citizen, we can pay a great tribute to them.
In a few days, Vikram Samvat will start.
Different states are celebrated separately.
I convey my best wishes to all for the New Year.
You can hear at your own time.
You can hear on your own mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
The youth of India takes time to get information about it and see it on TV.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have not got the opportunity to go.
As before, they dont go to the same routine, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
There is a possibility of a lot of employment through tourism.
Your self-confidence will increase so much by identifying your personality.
This will probably be a thing in your colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download this farmer's facility through App in your mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weight in your palm.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for the rest, heat has been an opportunity for the holidays but it becomes an opportunity for the farmer to sweat even more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gets ready to prepare his farm so that he does not want to waste even a drop of rain.
The time for the farmers to start the season of farmers is very important.
That food looks bad, huh
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were afraid but now we have become careless about TB.
My dear countrymen, greetings
You might have heard of my mind on the radio, but the brains would have been thinking that the exams of children are starting on the same day. Some people's 10th-12th exams are probably starting on March 1.
So the same will happen in your mind too.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally concerned about your children's exams.
But if we change our way of looking at exams and exams then perhaps we can be free from worry.
I had said in my previous mind that you must send me your experiences and suggestions on NarendraModiApp.
I am glad that teachers, those who have been doing a very successful job, such students, parents and some thinkers of the society have written to me a lot.
Secondly, there were thousands of things that I believe that this is probably a very important topic.
But most of us have limited theme to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
The suggestions that have been received on my App, it seems that these topics of students should be discussed in a very large and continuous manner in the entire nation.
Today, I want to talk to my parents especially with the test takers and their teachers in this regard.
I will tell some of the things I have heard, which I have read, which I have been told.
I will add whatever I think.
But I believe that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for those students who have to give exams.
I want to recite to you the message he has sent to the youth of India who have a sense of humility. - Namaskar, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that the exams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
My only message is that your parents, your teachers, the rest of your family members and friends will be there.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask how your preparations are going on, how many experts will score you.
I would like to say that you yourself will have some target set for yourself and you will not come to the prescribed prescribation of someone else.
You must work hard, but set a realistic achievable target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to include a solution.
And those targets I always tried to achiev.
My focus was on ball pages and targets automatically became sloughy-slowly adopted.
I will tell you that it is very important for you to be positive.
Positive thinking will follow positive results.
So you must be positive and give you good results, this is my full hope and I would like to give you best wishes for the exams.
Friends, see what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Don't press it under the weight of the expression.
You have to make your future.
You decide your goal by yourself, decide your own target - free mind, free thinking, free power.
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why do not we compete with ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our previous records
You see, no one will be able to stop you from proceeding and when you break your previous record, you will not expect anybody else for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be satisfaction from within.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a game of marks.
Where did you reach, how much
Do not get stuck in that account.
Life should be linked with a great purpose.
A dream should be followed, resolved.
These tests, whether we are going to be right or not, they account for it.
And that is why if we keep dreaming of this huge, then the examination will become a joyous festival in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
If you take a very big objective and sometimes it will be less than expected, then there will be no disappointment.
And to force, to force, and to try.
Thousands of people who have written me smaller than my mobile phone on my App.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that there is a healthy mind in a healthy body.
Students should also take care of your health along with your studies so that you can write well in the exams.
Now, on the last day, I will not say that you should start punishing and go for three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that how is your routine especially during the days of exams
Anyway, 365 days of our journey should be conducive to our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has specially urged him to sleep on time and revision early in the morning.
Entrance sheet and other things should be reached prematurely at the examination centre.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said that I do not dare to say this because I am a little indifferent to gold and my friends also keep complaining to me that you sleep very little.
This is one of my shortcomings, I'll try to fix it too.
Sleeping is as important as your day-long activities and this is possible.
Otherwise, some people have a habit, talk about long telephones before sleeping.
And when I talk about gold, don't think I'm asking you to sleep for eams.
I am talking about gold for a stress-free state to give you a good exam on the time of exam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not be that the marks should come down and the mother asked why the son, if he comes down, then say that Modiji had asked to sleep, then I was asleep.
Will not do this
I don't believe you.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if one or half part of our body suffers a bit.
Not only this, our routine also gets exhausted.
And that's why we don't consider anything small.
You see, do not trap yourself in the habit of compromising what is prescribed.
Determine it, do it.
You must have seen these two kinds of people.
There is a negative impact on the outcome of the paper that comes in its tension.
On Vishwanathan Anand, he will tell his experiences.
You must have seen that their eyes are not seen here and there.
Sometimes we used to listen or not, how did they look at the bird's eye in Arjun's life
In the same way, when we see Viswanathan playing, his eyes are at a greater target and he expresses the peace within.
It is true that it is difficult to say that if someone says it then there will be peace within it, but it should be tried.
If you are not talking to friends or are walking alone, you are encouraging, you are shaking a lot of books, you cannot be quiet.
You imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and look very good things below.
But suddenly a stone hits and water starts shaking in the water, then what looks good below, does it look like
If the water is calm, then how deep the things are, they are visible.
But if the water is turbulent, then nothing looks down.
You will not be able to find that treasure if there is a turbulent mind.
If there is a calm mind, it will emerge from your treasure and your exam will become very simple.
Sometimes I try to understand by concentrating more and more.
Then I feel, no, no, I'll relax a little, so I'll be fine.
So I have developed my own technology.
I'll do a lot of deep breathing.
I breathe deeply.
Three times I breathe deeply, the time goes 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my mind is completely calm and is ready to understand things.
Maybe this is my experience, you can also work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If parents are also educated in the house and even if there are teachers in it, then write the entire paper again, tell me what happened, what happened
Man, I made a mistake.
Hey man, I knew this, but I did not remember it.
We get stuck in it.
Refresh the memories of old laughter.
Sometimes you have gone somewhere with your parents, remember the scenes there.
Just leave them and spend half an hour.
Rajat ji's talk is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting it in the present context, is trying to reach Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to the revered Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you one more thing today.
I see that this time people have discussed Yoga in their experiences.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that somebody in the world whom I meet in these days does not get a little time, somebody does something or the other.
Friends, I must say this very day, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least exams, so do not do it today.
Do then do it.
But it is true that Yoga is a very big key to the development journey of the inner world, whether it is a student or a successor of life.
Simple key is simple.
You must pay attention to it.
Yes, if you will be aware of some yoga in your neighborhood, you will ask them that if you have not done the first yoga in the days of exam, then you will tell two or four things that you can do in two-five minutes.
See, if you can
Yes, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you are very quick to go to the examination hall.
Why do these things mess up
Why not manage your entire day's time so that if there is a stop in traffic, we can reach on time.
Otherwise such things create a new tension.
And one thing is that the number of times we have received, the question papers which are instructions, we sometimes feel that it will eat our time.
It's not like friends.
You should read those instructions closely. Two minutes or three minutes or five minutes, there will be no harm.
But with the confidence of the same paper, now I have this paper, I dont have any new questions, I have to deal with so many questions and when I started thinking again, he has written that I understood this paper so easily, for the first time I felt that it does not come to me, but if I have read the same thing again, then I have not come to mind whether the question has been kept in a different way, but this is the same thing that I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems difficult to understand the questions.
I emphasize that you read the questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match those questions with what you know. You see, those questions will be simple even before writing.
It is a matter of happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our very respected scientist CNR Rao have stressed on patience.
In very few words, he has given a very good message to all the students.
Whatever I take half an hour to say, they say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of scientific mind.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
What they have said is firmness, loyalty, dedication, determination.
If you are standing, then fear will also be scared.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do good.
Now on my App, a message enthusiast Dabus has shared his exam expertise.
He said that there is a constant effort in his family to create a positive atmosphere at the time of exam and this discussion was also held in his fellow families.
Together, the positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji said, the positive approach, the positive frame of Mind positive energy is highlighted.
Why don't you be at any stage of life, excellent examples, truthful events also inspire a lot, give a lot of strength and create a new path during the times of crisis.
We all read about Thomas Elva Edison, the inventor of Electricity Bulb, in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates the lives of our people.
It is said that there is a possibility of success in failure too.
J. K. Rolling is an excellent example that success can ever be achieved by anyone.
Harry Potter series is popular all over the world today.
But it was not so from the beginning.
How many problems they had to face
Rolling himself had said that in the difficulties, he used to put all the energy in that work, which really meant for him.
Nowadays, not just the students, but the entire family and the entire school becomes the teacher.
But without the support system of parents and teachers alone, the situation is not good.
If we become a team, if we move ahead in a planned manner with the same thinking as a unit, if we are a teacher, partners, even senior students then the examination becomes simple.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on App, he has complained that parents should never put pressure on their children to ask for more marks.
Just encourage to prepare.
They should be relaxed, they should worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not put the burden of his expectations on children.
This is right.
I don't want to say more to the parents today.
Please do not pressurize.
If he is talking to some of his friends, do not stop.
Build a light-hearted environment, create a positive environment. See how much confidence your son or daughter will come.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Knowledge, science, technology should become an easy part of our development journey and this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, sometimes successes take a long time and when success comes, the vision of watching the world also changes.
Perhaps you might have been very busy in the exam, so maybe there might have been a lot of risks in your mind.
But I also want to repeat this thing to my countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a very big and important host in the world of science.
The scientists of the world worked hard, the generations came, they did something or the other, and almost after 100 years they succeeded.
The gravitational waves were highlighted and detected by our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the last century, but is considered a great discovery for Physics.
But as an Indian, we all are happy that the sons of our country, the promising scientists of our country were associated with it in the process of all the discoveries.
I want to congratulate and congratulate all those scientists today.
Our scientific efforts will be made to pursue this host in the future.
There are two such arrangements in the world, India is the third.
By joining India, this process will get a new momentum, and new momentum.
India will surely be an active partner in the process of this important scientific host of human welfare among its limited resources.
I once again congratulate all the scientists and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I write a number to you, from tomorrow, you can hear my mind from this number by missed call and listen to your mother tongue.
I also have to give eam tomorrow.
125 crore countrymen are going to take my examination.
But yes, you must have seen, I must have heard how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Just get my exam tomorrow, let's start yourself.
And if we all succeed, then the country will also succeed.
Friends, Many best wishes to you too.
Free from the stress of success and failure, move forward from the free mind, stand up.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2015
I have a lot of vision on this portal.
No, we have to bring about a change in the requirements of India, if a poor person labours, he has a physical labour, but if a young man makes such a thing through innovation that the poor get a little comfort in the labour then I consider this as a start-up.
Then I got the idea in my mind that perhaps we feel that he is disabled, but with experience he feels that he has an extra power, an extra power. And then I came to my mind that why shouldn't we use the word Divya at the place of disabled persons in our country.
When we celebrate Republic Day on 26th January, can we commemorate the greatest sacrifices made by the citizens and the children of schools and colleges in our city on 26th January Can we commemorate the cleanliness, cleaning of that complex, better sanitation and best amenities on 26th January
Dear Countrymen, Namaste.
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated holidays very well.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with new enthusiasm, business employment will also have started.
Christmas preparations will also start on the other hand.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes the festivals come to use to fill the wounds, and sometimes the festival gives new energy.
But sometimes when there is a crisis at this time of the festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
Every corner of the world constantly reports about natural calamities.
Neither have you ever heard nor have you ever thought about such natural calamities.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
In our own country, in the last few days, the extremely rainy and unseasonal rains and long-term rainfall, particularly in Tamil Nadu, and the states have also been affected.
Many people were killed
I express my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State governments gather with full power in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works with shoulders.
Now a team of the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I believe that despite this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, he will start moving forward at a very fast pace and he will continue to play his role in pursuing the country.
But when they look at the crisis all around, we need to make a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, the natural calamity used to be part of an agriculture department, because then more natural calamities i.e. famine was limited to here.
Today its form has changed.
After Nepal's earthquake, I spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
There has been a good beginning.
I have got the phone of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab District Jalandhar.
We do organic farming here and guide a lot of people about farming.
I have a question of how those people who set fire to these fields, how to guide them to the puzzle or the shrub of wheat so that the micro-organisms of the mother Earth are being spoiled and how the pollution is happening in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab can get relief from this.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
One thing is that you are a farmer who cultivates organic farming.
And you do organic farming yourself. Not only this, you understand the problem of farmers well.
And your concern is correct but it is not just in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of our people in the whole of India and traditionally we follow the path of burning the remains of our crop.
Second, what are the measures, there is no training.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come towards the cities, a lot of noise started to be heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves have a biological manure.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the ground is burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters should think for a moment that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidneys should be good, but what would happen if the skin above the body is burnt
Similarly, the residues of these crops do not burn only thin stumps, this earth's skin burns.
The layer above our land is burnt, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And that's why we should make positive efforts.
Even if this thumb is pressed into the ground once again, it becomes fertilizer.
Or if you put some water in a pit by piling it in a pit and putting some water, then the best kind of organic manure comes in.
I once got an opportunity to talk to the farmers who cultivated bananas.
And he told me a great experience.
Earlier when he used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crops were over, he had to spend Rs. 5,000, 10 thousand, 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the bananas.
And till the people who took it did not bring a tractor-actor, they kept standing like this.
However, some farmers have developed 66, 8-8 inches of that chin and have buried it in the ground.
So the experience came that there is so much water in this banana thread that if there is a tree, if there is a plant, if there is a crop then there is no need to get out for three months.
Those who had to spend the first time in cleaning the chin, today the demand for that chin has increased.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, International Day of Persons with Disabilities will be remembered throughout the world on 3rd December.
Last time I had discussed the Organ Confederation in Mann Ki Baat.
I had also discussed the helpline of NEET for organ donation and I was told that after that, phone calls grew nearly 7 times.
Very well-known people, including film actress Raveena Tandon, joined it.
Organ Convention can save valuable lives.
Angadan brings immortality in a way.
When the organ gets a new life from one body to the other then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation from this
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness on this area and in the true sense the needy will get the best help because these help cannot be received from anywhere unless they donate.
As I said earlier, December 3 is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally disabled, they are also rich in an immense courage and capability.
Sometimes the pain occurs when they sometimes ridicule.
Occasionally a sense of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision and change our vision towards them then these people can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to go through.
If we get a little trouble then we sit to cry.
Then I remember that my crisis is very small, how does it live
And that is why all these are the source of inspiration for us.
Their will power, their way of fighting with their lives and their desire to convert the crisis into strength is also capable.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 years old.
In 1996 Kashmir, Javed Ahmed was shot by the terrorists.
Lost a part of the intestine and intestine.
The spinal cord of serious nature has become injurious.
The ability to stand on his feet always went to the house, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
The injury of terrorism also did not bother them.
His own zeal, but the biggest thing is that without any reason, an innocent person has suffered such a great problem, youth has been in danger, but no resentment, no anger has changed this crisis into sensation by Javed Ahmed.
He offered his life in social service.
The body does not accompany, but for 20 years they have been immersed in children's studies.
How did the infrastructure improve for the physically handicapped people
How to develop systems for disabled persons in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, I am talking about Javed but the lamps of such inspiration are burning in every corner of India.
Are giving new lights to live, showing the way.
On 3rd December, everyone remembers and inspires them.
Our country is so vast.
There are many things in which we are dependent on the governments.
For the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the dalit, the oppressed, the deprived and the deprived, there is a constant link between the government and the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes there is a bad experience in life with some government babu.
And that very bad experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout our life.
There is a truth in it, but sometimes millions of people sitting in this government do the best thing in terms of service, dedication and dedication that never comes under our sight.
Sometimes we don't even know because it is so easy that we don't know that a government system, a government office is doing this thing.
ASEA workers in our country which are networked across the country.
We have never heard of the discussions between the people of India regarding the ASEA workers.
But when I am the world's famous family entrepreneur of the Bilgates Foundation, his success in the world has become an example.
We had given joint Padma Vibhushan to both such billgates and Milindagates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
Whatever he has earned throughout his life and time of his retirement, he is spending in working for the poor.
Whenever they come and meet and those who have got the opportunity to work with the ASEA workers, they appreciate them so much, and they have so much to say that what kind of dedication they have to do to the ASHA workers.
He explains how much enthusiasm is there to learn new things.
In the past, the Orissa Government has specially honored an ASA worker on Independence Day.
A small village of Balasore district of Orissa, Tendagaon, is a hope-worker and the entire population of the schedule-tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Manisingh, a hope-worker of this village, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this length.
If you get to know about a small fever from home to home then reach it.
Based on the primary arrangements that have been taught to him, it is necessary to get treatment.
Emphasis on every household using pesticide mosquito nets.
As soon as the child sleeps properly and as much as the care should be done, the ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh continues to work with full dedication to save the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he fought with malaria, prepared to compete with the whole village.
How many Jamuna Mani will be
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We'll see a little bit of them with respect.
Such people become the biggest strength of our country.
How do the happiness and misery of the society become big partners
I salute all such ASEA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to see it.
See not only this, look at others also, read it and maybe you want to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
-Books should be discussed and if an enthusiastic young man goes to the schools in the neighborhood and tell the children of the eighth, ninth and tenth grade to see that this happened here.
So you can become a society teacher in a true sense.
I invite you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is concerned about climate change.
He is also concerned about climate change, global warming and drug addiction and it is getting acceptance as a standard before doing everything.
Earth's temperature should not increase now.
It is also the responsibility of everyone.
I had once said that one should shut the street lights on the night of full moon and bathe in the light of the full moon for an hour.
You should experience the light of that moon.
When a friend sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see it, I felt like telling you this thing too.
In Kanpur, a woman does not seem to be able to read more than a woman.
But one such thing is being done by someone who may not have thought.
He is working to give light to the poor using solar power.
He is fighting with darkness and illuminating his name.
She has formed a committee of women and has planted a plant of solar energy and she provides lanterns for a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
About Rs. 3-4 per day is spent but the entire household remains illuminated and this noorjah keeps working on recharging the lanterns with solar energy throughout the day.
Now see what the big people of the world will do for climate change, but a noorjaha may inspire everyone, it is doing such a thing.
And anyway, Noorjahan means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I also congratulate Lee Text because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the nation and the world.
Many congratulations.
Abhishek ji thanks
The message you sent to me from Gorakhpur.
Pradhan Mantri MRA Yojana fund the funded.
Those who do not get the money get the money.
By the way, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But in such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got 42 thousand crore rupees from the Pradhan Mantri MRAY scheme.
Whether it is dhobi, barber, seller or seller of milk.
Small businessmen and I am glad that there are 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And mostly the SC, ST, B are the people of this class who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told about his enthusiasm.
I also have a lot of news.
Someone just told me that there is a Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
He received a loan of Rs. 8.5 lakh from the bank under the MRA scheme.
And they started the business of sewage dress, cleanliness.
I had said in relation to my cleanliness drive that cleanliness drive is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosale did it.
They have brought a tanker and I was told that in such a short span of time they also returned the bank.
Finally, this is our intention under the MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Mamta Sharma of Bhopal that she got 40 thousand rupees from the bank from this Prime Minister MRA scheme.
He is working to make a wallet.
And she makes a wallet but earlier she used to get more money from interest and used to run the business with great difficulty.
Now, due to his good amount of money coming together, he made his work more good.
And due to the extra interest earlier and due to the excessive expenditure that he had spent on these days, this money came into his hands and almost a thousand rupees per month.
And his family started growing a good business gradually.
But I would like the plan to be more propagated.
All our banks are more sensitive and help more and more smaller people.
These people actually run the country's economy.
People who do small things are the economic power of the meaning of the country.
We want to emphasize it.
Good, but to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed an India-Best India.
These are things that should be constantly aware of social life.
Internal Vigilance is the pride of liberty, the unity of the country should continue.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, I want to make it a scheme.
MyGov had sought suggestions on it.
What is the structure of the programme
What are the people
How to increase public participation
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
Some big priests have also been declared.
You should also put your creative mind.
How can this mantra of unity integrity be made to connect this mantra with each and every Indian
What kind of plans are there, what kind of program
Whether it is a living or a magnificent person or a vibrant person, it is easy to connect everyone.
What should the government do
What do you do Civil Society
There may be many things.
It's fun to wear clothes, but I urge you to exercise.
I would urge you to use these good weather for some time or the other to keep the body healthy.
And that is why we should create an environment in the family, a festival of the family, an hour together.
So there is a good weather, then there is a good habit.
Once again I got the opportunity to join you all with the words of mind.
Today, the fifth one-day match between India and South Africa is going to play in Mumbai.
This is the series which has been named Gandhi Mandela series.
Therefore, the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all the players
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of AIR.
Congratulations are to be given that when I started talking about mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with reverence.
I have to talk about Kerala once again.
The students of Saint Mary Primary School of Chittoor, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
One, these girls have made a picture of India-Mata with their thumb marks, on a very big cloth.
He has sent me the image of India-Mata, India's map.
First I was surprised why he made a map of India with his thumb mark.
But when I read his letter, I realized how good symbolic message he had given.
These are the girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
They are also trying to make people aware in their area and their mission is Angadan.
They are running a mass awareness campaign for organ donation.
He has also done dramatic stages by visiting many places so that the understanding of angles spread among the people.
Angadan became a trend and trend.
These girls have written to me in the letter that you appeal to people about organ donation in your mind.
He says Angadan should be made a festival.
These days I also have a lot of messages on phone calls.
Devesh of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyes need light.
On the death of a road accident, the organ of the body can be donated.
There are many legal confusions too.
States have also been tried to guide in this direction.
Some states have made a very good effort to reduce the paperwork and speed it up.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the front line in the field of organ donation.
Many social institutions, several NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
In order to promote organ transplant, a National Urban and Tissue Transplant Organization (NET) has been established.
A 247 helpline 1800114770 service is also available.
And it has been said here that the joy of renouncing Tyakten Bhunjitha is very good in this mantra.
In the past, we all had seen on TV that a poor contractor, hawker and his wife were transferred to GB Pant Hospital in Delhi.
And this wiver was specially taken from Lucknow to Delhi.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Angadan Mahadan
We must fulfill this feeling and we must emphasize this thing.
Dear countrymen, we just celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days Deepawali will also celebrate the festival.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-fourth is also celebrated.
For the first time on the soil of India, such a huge scale is being organized.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
One of the largest conferences of African countries outside Africa is happening.
The relations between India and Africa are deep.
The number of populations that India has, the same population is from African countries.
And both of us are one-third of the world's population.
And it is said millions of years ago, it was the same territory.
Later these two pieces were divided from the Hindmahasagar.
There is a lot of equality between us.
And nearly 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural relations, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very important role in training the youngest generation of African countries.
More than 25 thousand African students have studied in India.
And today there are many leaders of African countries who have studied in India.
So how deep we have.
And from that point of view this Summit is very important.
Generally, when the summit is held, then the heads of different countries meet.
Similarly, there is a meeting of heads in a Summit.
See, it is our endeavor that these people should also meet.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the KRD Ministry, did a very good programme.
The programme was organised to enhance the participation of the children of those who have affiliated schools in the BSEs.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
Thousands of schoolchildren wrote about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the Memorials of Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace from Porbandar, an exhibition, Mobile Exhibition from Porbandar, is reaching Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, the villagers saw it.
There were very good types of creations in this competition.
I look at a composition, I like it, so I want to tell you.
But what is the opportunity to connect the people, it clearly shows us.
I congratulate the dignity, all the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and the RM.
On August 15, last time I had proposed a proposal regarding the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Staying in a big mind.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
In which where these ideal villages are happening, the head of the village, the collector of the area, some MPs of the country, the Indo-Government, all the state governments together discussed the topic of the ideal village scheme.
Under the influence of these leftist militants, many areas of the area have been wasted.
But our MPs are very senior and sometimes Deputy Speakers have also been in Parliament, Shriman Karia Munda ji and tribals have spent their lives.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate the Hon'ble MP Shri Karia Munda ji.
I got the same news from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself spent himself in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose the village panchayat for the ideal village through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the system is happening, but they have done a very special innovative job.
Shriman Ruvala ji started the Kurtai Kut Sugarcane festival in the village on 11th March.
The people of all the areas united in it.
How can the village be made the center of economic activity, how can the village market itself
His efforts to build an Adarsh village as well as a self-reliant village are truly acknowledged by Shriman Ruwala ji.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be so that there is no talk of cleanliness
Savita Rai from Mumbai has sent a message through a telephone. Every year we clean our homes for preparations for Diwali.
We should clean this Diwali along with our homes as well as the outer environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I want to remind you my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, specially the media of our country launched a massive campaign and after Diwali all the firecrackers were seen and they said that this is not right.
So it is true that we should do as much as we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today I want to especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
And I also saw how many kinds of activity was going on.
How many people are working themselves like the One Like One Mission for this.
How many places are there in our country that are kept so clean.
All these things were exposed and I congratulated the commendable work of the India TV Group at that time.
However, since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan, I have seen that Shriman Ramuji Rao from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, especially Shriman Ramuji Rao is very old but his enthusiasm is not less than a young man.
He added about 51 lakh children from around 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks, cleanliness drives in many places.
Now these news shows the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat in itself.
ABP News has started this programme in the name of India and has highlifted the awareness about cleanliness and trained the countrymen.
Our country has hundreds of channels, thousands of newspapers, everybody, I am not able to take the names of everyone because of lack of time, but this campaign has been launched.
And that is why Savita Rai ji's suggestion that today the entire country is accepting this task and is moving it forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor Shriman Shanmuganathan, he has written to me a pinch and wrote a pinch to mention me of Mavalyannong village in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the past several years, this village has been taking a lead in cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this sanitation.
And it is said that a few years ago, he received the award as the Leanest Village in Asia.
That is why we all believe that our country will definitely be clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say that 1. 25 billion countrymen will be proud of it. See, we have freed our mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on 15th August that there are some things where corruption has gone home.
When a poor person goes for a small job, no one knows about the recommendation of someone- do they have to suffer and how the brokers' group grabs money from them.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who examines a person in an interview of one minute or two minute.
And I had announced in this regard that why shouldn't we finish the tradition of interview
My dear young friends, today I want to proudly say that the government has completed the entire process and there will be no interview for recruitment in Group D, Group C and Group B posts of the Central Government.
January 1, 2016 will be implemented
We will not make any obstacles in the process where the process is going on, but, it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
My best wishes to all young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget we had announced an important plan.
Gold in our country has become a part of social life in a way.
Gold is considered to be the medium of economic security.
The key of crisis time has been considered as gold.
Gold can become the economic property of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am glad that we are going to launch important schemes before the promise we made in the budget, in the festival of Diwali and when Dhanteras and people especially buy gold on that day.
We have brought the Gold Monetization Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as you deposit your money and get interest.
We used to keep the first gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now you will keep in the gold bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Can the countrymen now become a gold property or not
Can't gold be converted into a vibrant force from Head-Money
That's what we have to do.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
Another thing is that in the Sovereign Gold Bonds, there is no golden ladder in your hands.
You'll get two and a half thousand rupees in return for that paper.
So we are starting this.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will put this scheme of security in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold queens.
Around 70 years have passed since the independence of Ashok Chakra, but till now we have been using the Foreign Gold Coin or the Gold Bullion Bars.
Along with this, 20 grams of gold will also be available for the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on October 31.
Ek Bharat Shresth Bharat
After remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of entire India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot for India's unity.
Iron-male has introduced his strength as a man.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but his dream of uniting India was his dream.
Geographically he showed taxes, but the mantra of unity should be the medium of our contemplation, behaviour, expression.
Several sects, many sects, many dialects, many castes, many environments, our country full of diversity and this diversity is due to which we are proud.
If there was no diversity then perhaps we would not be able to do the beauty we are proud of.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity are the herbs of development.
Over the last several years, on October 31, there are Run for Unity programmes in many corners of the country.
I have heard that this time too, its plans are being made around, people are preparing for the race for unity with enthusiasm.
The race of unity is the race for development in the true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development race is also a race of unity.
Let's pay tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Push forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, now all of you will be engaged in the preparations for Diwali, there will be cleanliness in the house.
New things will be purchased.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated separately in every corner of our country.
I extend my best wishes to you for the holy festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come to mind.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I have to visit Britain.
I am very excited for my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such sections of the society, be it Dalits, Adivasis or Backward, those promising children who go abroad.
I am confident that when such children of India go to study in the UK, this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage area for them, it will become an inspiration land and learn something in life but later on it is the message given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that in my visit to Britain, I am specially thrilled, the subject has been entangled for several years and now that building becomes a property of 1. 25 billion countrymen, if Baba Saheb Ambedkar is associated with it then you can imagine how much happiness it will be for people like me.
I am going to get another opportunity in London, unveiling the statue of Lord Visveswara.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Visveswara did for democracy and for the Employment of Women is a really learning aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Visveswara on the soil of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India thought centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are related then the heart of all of us becomes thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are connected with the talk of mind.
Through telephone, I get your suggestions through MyGov.in.
There is also discussion on AIR in your letters.
Government officials are called and discussed.
Some people write their problems, efforts are also made to solve problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
Some languages have got the privilege of learning, but still there are so many languages that where did I learn
But still I am grateful to AIR that at 8 o'clock in the night, he broadcasts this matter in the regional language of every state.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the thing is of my mind.
I was completing one year in the past. Today we are entering the new year.
My best wishes to my dear countrymen once again.
Jai Hind.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2015
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
On the other hand, the Parliament of India is also discussing for the sanitation of India and on the other hand, on the one hand, the Parliament and the infants of this country should talk about sanitation, on the other hand what could be the good fortune of a bigger country than this.
The institutions of local Swaraj - whether it is Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, municipality, municipality or state - everyone has to work on it. We have to carry forward this movement with deficiencies and we have to move forward in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we should work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi. And you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
And I was surprised that the girl, the entire Gita was stubborn, but the biggest thing was that when I asked her, she used to interpret it in English, interpreted it in English, used to define it in Hindi. I asked her father, she said, she is speaking from the age of five, I said, I have learnt
He said, We don't even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, only the Gita reads and does anything
Once again, I got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about the mind.
In the far south, people are dyed in the festival of Onam, and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes related to social security for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short time, in a comprehensive proof, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small suggestion that we should give this security scheme to our sisters on the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The fat information that I have received is that eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since the launch of the scheme.
And I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider it auspicious sign.
I also convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a large scale a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
ero balance was to open an account but the poor saved and saved the amount of Rs.
The mainstream of the economy is the banking sector and this system has reached the poor house, hence the bank-friend's plan has also been emphasized.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
And now thousands of people have become entitled to overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
And the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again, I congratulate all the concerned and I urge all the poor and poor brothers and sisters to open the bank accounts that you should not break the ties with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it anymore.
I'm bringing you up, now it's your job to hold him.
All of our accounts should be active
But in a very short time, the enlightened, all my citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again Gujarat went on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brotherhood is the right path and we have to walk on the path of development by joining the shoulder.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of Sufi tradition.
They got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I am telling the truth that the way I got the opportunity to listen to them, in a way a music is ringing.
The choice of their words, their way of conversation, that is, the generosity in the Sufi tradition, in which there is a musical rhythm, all of them have experienced me among these scholars.
I liked a lot.
Perhaps the world has become the most important to reach the true nature of Islam.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition, which is associated with love and generosity, will bring this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity and will also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any sect, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days, and I consider this invitation as my good fortune.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are coming to Bodh Gaya, and are going to discuss global issues related to humanity, I have also received an invitation in it, and it is a matter of great happiness for me that those people have invited me to come to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodh Gaya.
I am going to have the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya along with these scholars from all over the world. It is a moment of joy for me.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you about Mann Ki Baat.
I have already mentioned this topic in the matter of mind.
You must have heard me in Parliament, you must have heard in public meetings, you must have heard in the matter of mind.
I have come here once again to say that the government's mind is open on the issue of a dispute regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers. I have been saying this repeatedly.
This means that the situation before my government was formed has now been restored.
But one work was incomplete and that was 13 such points which had to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought it in the Ordinance but the issue was also entangled in these disputes.
Ordinance is ending, but the 13 points which are directly benefitted by the farmers, the direct economic benefit of the farmers, we are implementing these 13 points under the rules so that the farmers do not suffer losses or the economic losses. Therefore, we are completing the 13 points which were left in the previous law and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not a slogan for us. This is our mantra - the welfare of the village, the poor farmers. And only then we had said on 15th August that we will not only be created by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare but we have made the decision of which we have taken very fast.
I have to say one more thing that two days ago the war of 1965 took fifty years and when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is natural to remember Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan Mantra too.
And it is natural for all those martyrs to remember the tricolor flag of India, its valour and valour.
I salute all the stakeholders of the victory of 65 war.
I salute the heroes.
And the events of such history continue to inspire us.
Just as I had the opportunity to meet the people of Sufi tradition last week, there was a very pleasant experience.
I had the opportunity to talk to the dignitaries of the country for hours.
I am glad that in the field of science, India has been doing excellent work in many directions.
Our scientists are actually doing the best type of work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these amendments to the masses.
How to convert the principles into equipment
How to add Lab to Land
He has to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that he was also a very inspiring person for me.
And I have seen how many young scientists were talking to them, how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said in my mind last time that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are plenty of opportunities and many possibilities.
I keep getting many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Shriman Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I specially want to tell my young friends that I had asked the Red Fort on 15th August that why this interview for lower level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also one of the reasons for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on 15th August that I want freedom from the tradition of interview below one level.
I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has been 15 days but the government is moving forward very fast.
Information is being sent and the decision will be implemented soon that small jobs will be exempted from the interview.
The poor will not have to run for recommendation.
There will be no deployment or corruption.
These days there have been guests from many countries of the world in India.
For health, especially for the mothers and children, the All to Action for their Action Plan was contemplated in the land of India in collaboration with 24 countries of the world.
This was the first time outside the US, this program was held in another country.
And it is true that even today, nearly 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die in our country at the time of delivery and immediately after that.
This is worrying and scary.
Well, the improvement is enough.
India has started to appreciate internationally, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborn children.
Brothers and sisters, nowadays news of dengue continues.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And that thing that I am talking about a clean India is directly linked to it.
We see advertising on IT but we don't care.
Advertisement is printed in the newspaper but our attention is not taken.
There are ways to maintain cleanliness in small things in the house with pure water.
There is widespread public education in these things, but we do not notice and sometimes it seems that we live in a very good house, we have a very good system and we do not know that we have water filled somewhere and somewhere we invite dengue.
I would urge all of you that we should not allow death to be so cheap.
Life is very precious.
It is not okay to become the cause of water illiteracy, sanitation and death.
Free investigation facilities are available for dengue at around 514 centers across the country.
Since time, it is useful to save life and cooperation with you all is very important in it.
And cleanliness should be of great importance.
These days, festivals are celebrated in our country in a way from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why not add every festival to cleanliness now
You see the rituals will become nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to tell you a good news, I always say that now we will not get the privilege of dying for the country, but it has got the good fortune of living for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
In America, Race Across America is a cycle race, it is very difficult, it is about four thousand eight hundred kilometers long race.
This year these two brothers won this race.
See how everybody is making efforts to pursue the country.
And this is the case, when such incidents are heard then the chest gets tired.
Occasionally, due to perception, we commit great injustice to our youth.
And the old generation always feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this series has been going on for centuries.
Experience in relation to my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth, then we also get a lot to learn.
I have met many youngsters who say that Bhai, I have taken a fast in life on Sunday.
Some people say that I have kept a day ycle-day in a week.
It's good for my health too.
And I also enjoy my youth.
Nowadays, bicycle runs in many cities in our country and people who promote bicycles are also very much.
But they are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today when two youngsters of my country hoisted the flag in the US, I like to mention the direction in which the youth of India think.
I want to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra, particularly today.
I'm happy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - The land of Indu Mill in Mumbai - had been hanging for a long time to build his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand inspirational monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who will continue to inspire us to work for Dalits, victims, exploited and deprived.
But at the same time, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has also been purchased.
When the Indians travelling around the world will go to London, the memorial that Baba Saheb Ambedkar is going to build there will be an inspiration for us.
I salute and congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My dear brothers and sisters, You must tell me your thoughts before the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, because I believe that democracy runs with public participation.
The country can move forward only by joining the shoulder.
My best wishes to you.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely help in sowing kharif.
And a matter of happiness has come to my attention and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should also have pulses, there should be some oil in vegetables and so on.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, on July 26, Kargil is marked as Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The country's farmer's relationship is as much from the land as the youth of the country.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was heavy on hundreds of enemies.
I salute those brave soldiers who have failed their enemies by not taking care of their lives.
Kargil war was not fought on the borders only, every city of India, every village contributed to this war.
This war fought for those mothers and sisters whose young sons or brothers were fighting against the enemies in Kargil.
Those daughters fought, with whose hands, the peacock did not land.
And that is why, today on Kargil Vijay Diwas, I salute all these soldiers for centuries.
I consider myself very important from the point of view of July 26, because in a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we started MyGov on July 26.
Our resolve to increase public participation in democracy, to connect the people with the work of development, and today it is a pleasure to say that after a year, nearly two crore people saw MyGov.
Nearly five and a half lakh people made their comments, and the most happy thing is that more than fifty thousand people suggested on PM applications, they took time out, mind applyed the work as important.
Now the matter is small, but no one has ever noticed this in the government, nor was it thought about it.
But the government seriously considered the suggestion of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee, and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, those people who are formed, those who become taglines, programmes are composed, policy is created, MyGov has very positive suggestions.
There is an experience of a new tree in the governance system.
There is experience of a new consciousness.
These days I have started suggestions on MyGov, what should I say on 15th August
Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Daughter-daughter, speak on daughter-daughter, speak on Clean Ganga, speak on Swachh Bharat.
But this gave me an idea, what should I say on August 15 this time. Can you send me suggestions
You can send a letter to MyGov, write a letter on AIR and write a letter to the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe that perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on 15th August should be suggested by the people.
I believe you'll send good suggestions.
One thing I want to express my concern.
I do not want to give any preaching nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibilities of the units of the state government, central government or local Swaraj.
Just two days ago, I looked at an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was suffering for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people keep writing to me on the fact that you should say something on the road safety.
Conscious of the people. Hoshakote Akshay of Bangalore, Amay Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidari of Karnataka.
And when you look at the data, the heart shakes.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to accident, due to road accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes.
And the biggest concern is that nearly one-third of those who die are young people between 15 and 25 years of age and one death shakes the whole family.
The government should do whatever work should be done, but I request my parents, whether they run a two-wheeler or run a four-wheeler, the atmosphere of focus should also be increased in the family.
There is another project for us, it is going to expand further, it is going to be expanded, it means that who will not pay the money for the first fifty hours, who will not pay the money for the first time, who will get the best service from Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia highways to those injured in the road accident, we are giving priority to how to get the best service from them.
To provide information about accidents across the country, toll-free 1033 numbers, ambulance arrangements, all these things are after accident.
We all are really very dear to see one life, one life is very dear to see it in the form of an accident.
Sometimes I say, become an employee worker.
Some incidents have come to my notice in the past, I felt good that I should talk to you, sometimes the person is tired of doing a job, and for a few years it is okay, pays, works, this is the feeling.
I liked this great example of how life can be brought to my work too.
Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art and his ability can be linked with his work.
Maybe Vijay Biswal's paintings will be discussed in the coming days.
Moreover, one more thing came to my mind - the entire team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh and the entire group started a work that touched my heart and I like this thing.
He started Operation Malaysia - Now someone, listening to it will be something else.
See how Raksha Bandhan has changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Sometimes these small things enjoy my heart, so I am sharing with you.
There is a small village by crushing in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have tried to make toilets for the last few months.
And now no person has to go to the open in that village.
He did this, but when the entire work was completed, the entire village celebrated such a big festival as it is celebrated.
These best examples of how the society is changing the values in life, how the minds of the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, regarding the questions of North-East.
However, the people of North-East are also very much active.
They keep writing a lot, it's good.
But today I want to tell them that there is a separate ministry for the Northeast.
They will go to the districts, go to the villages, meet the local government officials, talk to the people's representatives, talk to the citizens.
They will listen to the problems, they will also do what the Government of India has to do to solve the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And the officials who come to taxes also feel that how beautiful state, how good people, now they have to develop this area only by solving their problems.
If you return with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very easy to understand the problems there.
So, a good effort, an effort to go far and wide from Delhi to the East, which I am saying Act East Policy, this is the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all are proud of the success of the Mars Mission.
But sometimes this idea also comes that today if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to be ahead then one or half of the 100 students will be found who will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern to reduce the trend towards science.
There is a great need to take interest in innovation, encourage them, know their capabilities.
I am also telling the IAS officers of the government that if you have gone ahead by writing so much, you should also go to a school college near yourself for two or four hours a week and talk to the children.
Your experience, your strength will certainly be used for this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have started this and in the coming years, we will get 24-hour electricity to the villages.
If the children of the village also have to study in the days of examination, then there is no problem of electricity.
If there are small industries in the village, then electricity is available.
Today, even if we need to charge mobile, we have to go to another village.
The benefits that the cities get should be met by the villages.
And that is why we have started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme.
I know that such a large country, lakhs of villages and villages have to reach far and wide.
But, it is only for the poor to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, I have decided to talk about a lot of things.
In a way, our country has the opportunity to celebrate the month of August, September and festivals.
There are a lot of festivals.
My best wishes to all of you.
You must send me suggestions for 15th August.
Your thoughts will be of great help to me.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had prayed to you people that if you go anywhere in the holidays, if there is a memorable picture then the Incredible Infrastructure
When I said, I didn't think that such a massive result would be.
Millions of people posted photos, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
I can say that more than one scene can be seen, India is full of diversity.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers or seas.
Perhaps the Government of India has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big thing that you people have done.
And I also felt so much that I also re-tweeted it.
We will continue, the world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see it.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister, but sometimes the person within me loses himself from all other positions.
21st June, International Day of Yoga, I can say that my mind has been agitated in the same way as I had put this topic in the NCE.
We can say with the claim that the sun never sets in the world of yoga practitioners.
The way Yoga has been honoured by the world by laying the footpaths, the way the world has taken it on its shoulders, who will not be proud of it.
The mind became frustrated.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sean River and the Field Tower are very glorious, they preferred that place to do yoga and gave it the place of equality.
People in New York did yoga on Times Sure.
If we talk about Australia and Sydney then the picture of Pera House comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time by placing yoga as per per pera House.
Whether it is North America, Silicon Valley, Milan's eumo athedral, it is a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, the NPE-Keeeping Force also performed very well in Yoga.
Even in India, our soldiers were doing yoga on Siachen, white ice sheet, and Yoga programmes were organized by the Navy in the sea, all around, wherever our Navy ships were.
Delhi has registered its position in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogapath.
I am grateful to the country and the world, and I can say that this was not a programme.
It seemed as if every corner of the world had a new curiosity, a new joy, a new eagerness, a new engagement.
A few days ago, when I had tweeted a photo on Twitter, a family from Vietnam summed up a small child, it was so favourable that it became so popular all over the world.
Everyone, male and female, adults, villages, developed countries or developing countries, everyone has joined.
Yoga became a reason for connecting the world in a true sense.
But I feel one thing, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very keen to know India.
A curiosity towards India has increased.
The values here, the traditions here, the legacy here, the world wants to know.
It is the responsibility of all of us that we should share this legacy of ours without logging the world and familiarize the world.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that what is new in our things, what is new in it, like our family values, we don't know that India's family values are very big for the world.
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
There are many things that our ancestors have given us and the best that the world has the right to do.
The success of International Yoga Day has brought a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give the best yoga teacher to the world.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from the world on a platform.
Introduction of institutions related to yoga, information about yoga gurus, information about yoga.
If you want to learn yoga then you can learn where to get Yoga teachers, where to prepare a database and I believe that you can do it.
Come on, let's start somewhere, this will also become a new power.
I have seen the events of the past few days, the government, the running government, once the targets are set, we have seen the results in the past few days.
And when there was disappointment all around, we should not forget that one voice was heard from all around a year ago, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government, sometimes nobody pays attention to it.
In 2-5 years, when a small news comes in the newspaper, so much so that in one corner, a small department, but he leads Yoga Day.
And the small departments in the world have organized such a big task.
If the goal is in front, then how much the small unit works, it is a sample.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved people from Yemen.
Within hours, how did the people of India reach Nepal to help, when the government was working to open a Jan Dhan account in the bank, the people of all the banks came to the ground and in a short span of time crores of countrymen were linked to the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed for toilets in schools from Red Fort and I had said that we have to complete this work by August 15.
The work that was not done in 60 years was a great courage to call for one year, about four and a half lakh toilets were built, but today I can say with satisfaction that it is delayed on 15th August, but it is not complete, but people have completed the work of making toilets in nearly-about schools.
I mean government, people, government officials, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month we launched three public security schemes, I had done it from Calcutta.
There has been very positive results in such a short time.
There has been very little work in terms of public safety in India but due to these three schemes we are putting a huge jam.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these people but we have to move it further.
Raksha Bandhan festival comes in August.
On behalf of Raksha Bandhan's brother, sister can have a very big gift.
Let us all make efforts to fulfill this resolution by joining me.
When I talk about mind, many people send me suggestions too.
This time I should say something for the monsoon, many people have sent such suggestions.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyaanshu Gupta ji, he said that you must tell something about the mind for the monsoon.
They have sent good suggestions.
You can also enjoy hot pakodas, bhajiye, corner and tea in the rain.
But as well as the sun's rays give life, the rain enables our lives.
The water of the village should remain in the village, the water of the city should remain in the city, this should be our resolve and efforts should be made to stop the water.
And rain water stops and if there is a recharge in the ground then problems of the year are solved.
I always tell the people that if you visit Porbandar in Gujarat and if you visit Mahatma Gandhi's house then there is a tank inside his 200-year-old house in the geography where rain water was arranged to go straight there.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was stored in the house by collecting rain water.
We can also do it.
All of us should be planting trees, planting trees in this rainy season through social organizations and youth in large quantities.
And I give a suggestion and I have a direct experience, a successful experience.
This is my total rural technology.
When you plant a plant, then put an old soil pot in the garden of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill water once in a month, it will also run.
I keep telling the farmers to plant trees instead of fencing on the edge of your farm.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the rainy days, diseases spread a lot.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria start flourishing and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
Urge to drink pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of care we will do will be far away from us.
Water should also be required, rain should also be avoided but disease should also be avoided.
Our countrymen, we have just launched three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities eligible for life.
In the same way, there should be a country that can equalize the world.
There should be such a smart city in the country and on the other hand, the poorest of the poor should also have their own house to live in. And the house should also have electricity, water, toilets and schools to read nearby.
In 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, we want to give home to the countrymen.
With these three things, we have started a big scheme.
I am confident that all these schemes will work in bringing about a change in urban life.
I myself have been associated with you all through social media, many new ideas keep meeting me with you people and also get good information about the government.
But sometimes a person sitting in a remote village also touches our hearts.
You know, a daughter-saving-daughter education program is going on from the government.
But when the government's program is made by a person, society, village, then how much increases its strength.
In the past, Shriman Sunil Jaglan ji, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village in Haryana, took him a very fun filled initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to children.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
Highest in Haryana
But the Sarpanch of a small village of Haryana gives such a turn to the Beti Bachao Abhiyan, then the mind is very happy, and a new hope is awake.
That's why I express my happiness.
But this incident has also inspired me and therefore I also urge you to post the selfiewithdaughter with your daughter, well with your daughter.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao will write a tagline that gives strength to this idea and write a good line, it can be done in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue, any language.
The very motivated tagline that I will be from it will be selfie of your daughter and I will retweet you.
In a way, all of us can teach daughter Bachao-daughter and convert this into a mass movement.
The work that was started by brother Sunil from Bibipur village of Haryana and let us all move ahead and I urge you to post the selfiewithdaughter.
Best wishes to you all in this rain, please enjoy the rain.
Make our country green.
You should continue the practice of Yoga not for one day but for the International Yoga Day.
You see, you'll see the advantage of it.
Make it a part of your life, do it.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere, keep sending photographs.
The country and the world will know how much diversity our country has.
I felt that it has been very low in respect of handicraft.
We have to reach the world, to bring the characteristics of India around.
And we have a simple medium, we'll definitely reach.
My dear countrymen, today I will only meet next time for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
He used to listen, repeat, repeat and sometimes become an inspiration for his own words and inspiration for his own people.
You can imagine how it must have been in the middle of the period.
Perhaps, this wasn't a lifeless program
This programme was lifestyle, adoption, mental attachment, heart-related connectivity, and because of this, the time spent between me and me felt very difficult.
I was missing something every moment and when I talk about my mind, the words may be mine, the voice is mine, but the story is yours, the meaning is yours, the grace is yours.
was feeling an emptyness
But this Sunday has waited a lot
Well, it's got a chance.
Several messages have come in the last few months in which people have said that they are missing Mann Ki Baat
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to the world
This is my important journey to the yum
For me, this silent dialogue with you was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath
Most people have derived political meaning from it
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me
In a way, I went to meet me.
I will not tell other things today, but I will definitely do that because of this shortcoming of Mann Ki Baat, in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given the opportunity to fill something.
The rest of your curiosity - I think I ' m going to discuss it .
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your efforts to strengthen a positive thing, I feel consistently in your point of view.
The letters that come to mind, the inputs that are received are completely different from the routine government functioning.
In a way your letter also becomes a cause of inspiration for me and sometimes becomes a cause of energy .
Sometimes my thought process is used by some of your words
People, if they keep the challenges facing the country and society in front of them, they also tell solutions.
If someone writes for hygiene , he is resentful of filth but also appreciates the efforts of cleanliness .
If someone talks about the environment, he feels pain, but at the same time, the experiment that he himself has experimented tells him the experiment he has seen and the imagination that he has in his mind also depicts.
It tells us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
Need to incorporate those strengths and talents, provide opportunities, implement them
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that in the progress of the country, 130 crore countrymen want to be connected with strength and activism. And I must say one thing that I get so many letters, so many telephone calls, so many messages are received, but the element of the complaint is very low and someone has asked for something for himself.
When I analysis these things you can imagine how much pleasure my heart will be, how much energy will I get
Actually I'm not here - you've brought me, you've set me up and you've given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this spirit, let's go ahead with the talk of mind
When the Emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to political circles, it was not limited to politicians, the movement was not limited to prison bars.
During the Emergency, every citizen of the country had started feeling that something had been taken away.
Recently, the Mahaparv of Democracy, the massive election campaign, the rich and the poor in our country, were all ready to decide the future of our country with joy in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, its amazing factors are also ignored.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted.
This number may seem very common to us, but if I say in terms of the world, if we leave China, more people than any country in the world were voting in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, almost double
The number of total voters in India is more than the population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness and vastness of our democracy .
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the worlds largest democratic election in history so far
You can imagine how big resources and manpower would have been required in conducting such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees became possible with hard work day and night
In order to successfully complete this Mahayagya of Democracy, where about 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces performed their obligation, 20 lakh policemen from different states also laboured.
The hard work of these people resulted in more voting than last time .
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big
All this was done so that it can be ensured that no voters are deprived of their franchise
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was created for just one female voter.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India
The polling station is located at an altitude of 15000 feet in Lahaul-Safiti area of Himachal Pradesh
Besides, there is also another proud fact in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted like men with enthusiasm.
The percentage of voting of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are 78 women MPs in Parliament
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process, and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth, don't book, I was urging you to give books instead of flowers in welcome.
Since then , people have started giving books in enough space .
However, I could not find much time, but during my stay, I got an opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His stories include the mood of the whole of India
When I was reading the story of his drunkenness, my mind went to the economic inequalities prevailing in the society itself.
The story of the zamindar's son Ishwari and the poor family's Bir learns that if you are not cautious then when the effect of bad company gets over, it is not known.
The second story, which touched my heart, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, so much mature at such a young age
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his grandmother with a pinch from the fair, then in reality, human sensation reaches its peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a great truth of life, child Hamid played the part of old Hamid, old Amina and girl Amina.
Such a great story is the night of Poona
In this story a live depiction of the irony of a poor farmer ' s life was found .
Even after the destruction of its crop, the light farmer is happy because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter
Although these stories are almost a century ago, but their relevance still feels the same.
After reading them, I had a different kind of feeling
When it is talking about reading, in any media, I was reading about Kerala's Akshara Library
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the middle of the dense forests of Idukki.
P. K. Muralidharan, a primary school teacher and P.V. Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling the bundle and putting it on the back
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
Millions of people of every age group participated in this campaign of reading books
In today's digital world, at the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take some time out and place the book in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy a lot and write about whatever book you read on the NarendraModi App so that all listeners of the mind will be able to know about it .
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country are thinking about issues which are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Pawan Gaurai of Belgavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water is of great importance in our culture
You give your blessings like your mother , i . e . your grace pours on us .
Due to lack of water many parts of the country are affected every year .
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from rain in a year is saved in our country .
I am confident that like other problems, we will also address this crisis with public participation, manpower, capability, cooperation and resolve of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping the importance of water paramount
This will enable faster decisions on all water related issues .
A few days ago I tried to do something different .
I wrote a letter to Sarpanches across the country to Gram Pradhan
I wrote to the village heads that to save water, to accumulate water, to save rain water, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and discuss with the villagers.
I am glad that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month millions of people have laid down their lives in thousands of panchayats .
People in village-village resolved to collect one drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
Listen, what is my name Dilip Kumar Ravidas, the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Cuttackmasandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand
The people there are once again ready to play their active role for water conservation
My best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, all the Sarpanches, for their activism.
There are several Sarpanchs across the country who have taken up the task of water conservation
In a way the entire village has become an opportunity
It seems that the people of the village have now gathered in their village, as in the competition to build water temples
As I said, collective efforts can get big positive results
There cannot be a single formula for dealing with water crisis all over the country .
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that is to save water, water conservation
Drinage lines are being cured in Punjab
This effort is getting rid of the water logging problem
The construction of the tank in Thimmaipalli (Thimipalli) of Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, small ponds built in the fields have brought about a major change.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are doing a great job together on rainwater harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we are united and striving hard, we can also make it possible.
When people will connect, water will survive
Today through Mann Ki Baat I am requesting the countrymen 3
My first request is to start a mass movement for water conservation just as the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement.
Together we should resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is God's offerings, water is the form of Paras.
First used to say that iron becomes gold from the touch of Paras .
I say water is Paras and from Paras, from the touch of water, new life is created
Start an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Tell about water related problems, as well as propagate ways to save water.
I specially urge the people of different regions to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is film industry, sports world, media companions, people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organisations, people associated with stories, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awaken the society, add society, join society
You see, we will be able to see changes in front of our eyes
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for the protection of water in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share those traditional methods of water conservation
If one of you had the opportunity to visit Porbandar and Pujya Bapu's birthplace then there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu, there is a water storage tank of 200 years old and even today there is water and there is a system to stop rain water. So I always used to say that whatever Kirti Mandir goes to see the stalks of that water.
Let us connect with water conservation by creating a list of more and more methods and motivate people for water conservation
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShakti hashtags
My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude for one more thing and also express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again in Yoga Day with the activism, enthusiasm, three-four generations of each family celebrated Yoga Day together.
Awareness for Holistic Health Care is increasing the month of Yoga Day.
Everyone, in every corner of the world, if a yogic lover welcomes him as soon as the sun emerges, then there is a complete journey of sunset.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to the Submarine, from air-force to aircraft carriers, from Agyms to the hot desert, from villages to cities, not only was yoga done everywhere, but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities, common citizens of many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a happy family
We all know that healthy and sensitive individuals are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures that
Therefore the promotion of yoga is a great task of social service
Should not he be honored by recognizing such a service
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards for excellent contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been given to organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, who has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roi of Italy who started Sarva Yoga International and propagated Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in themselves
If this is a matter related to yoga, can Indians stay behind
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honored and dedicated to Yoga for the last several decades.
It is a very important journey for me to connect with your thoughts .
Let us continue to meet, talk
Listen to your feelings, keep watching, keep understanding
Sometimes I try to live those feelings
Keep your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Come together and enjoy the talk of mind and keep on fulfilling the responsibilities of life
Then once again next month we ' ll meet again for the talk of mind .
Thank you very much to me
This season is also of heat on one side, so it is also of some kind of grief.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2015
Mann Ki Baat, December 2014
And I have done a special one-hour programme and I have seen that there was no programme for the evils of the government, there was an anxiety and I believe that in a way there was a jeopardy of getting out of the problem and that is why the atmosphere of a good discussion has started.
Have you ever thought
Imagine
This is the money of drugs if they go to the terrorists
With these money , if terrorists buy weapons .
And with the same weapons , a terrorist will shoot bullets in the chest of my countrymen .
My country's soldiers will be martyred
Have you ever thought that the person who killed the mother's red, the life-loving mother of India, the life-loving person of the country, the soldier's chest has been shot, isn't it
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their secular progress with our children
Modiji, are you not tired
One month is very long .
Many incidents take place in the country and the world .
You all celebrated Diwali with fervor and enthusiasm .
Festivals are celebrated from time to time in life, whether it is poor or rich, whether it is from village or city, everybody has his own greatness in the life of the festival.
Sometimes they think that people are useless , people have nothing to do . Our country is like this .
I talk of my last mind and today I say that it is very important to change this thinking. Our country is not like this, people of our country are not like this.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead, the governments are far behind.
And when I say with experience that perhaps governments also need to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I see that these young people are committed to do something or the other of India, they are looking for opportunities.
and doing it in its own way .
I had said last time, buy at least one khadi cloth.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become a khadiher . But I learned from the Khadi stores that sales grew by about a hundred percent of the Hundred and Twenty - five percent in a week .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in a week from 2nd October to 1st October , as compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the Indians .
Cleanliness. One can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of a mass movement.
There are plenty of expectations and must be .
And a good result is coming to me, cleanliness is now seen in two parts.
One of the old filth that is dirty is a government machinery. What measures will people sitting in the government do for it
There is a very big challenge , but you cannot run away from responsibility .
All governments have to take steps for this responsibility because public pressure is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect that is very exciting , enjoying and satisfying the mind . The common man feels that let ' s quit earlier , we will no longer filthy .
We ' re not going to be in a new shit .
He has sent a mail to me at my gov.
He was going to visit his.Railway, his own experience said. He said that I used to go to the railway earlier, this time also I went to the railway but I see that people keep eating and drinking in every passenger.Railway, keep throwing paper and paper. Nobody throws it, not only did they find that there is a dustbin in the box, put garbage in it.
And when he noticed that there was no provision in the railways , he himself collected his garbage in the corner .
He said it was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharat ji for delivering this information to me .
But I see that the biggest impact has been on small children .
Hundreds of families talk about the fact that if our child still eats chocolates somewhere then the paper takes it immediately .
I just saw someone in a social media that someone had written. Today's my hero. And in today's hero, he gave a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone has started feeling that our country, we will not be dirty.
We ' re not going to be filthy .
Whatever they do, they feel embarrassed, and somebody gets to touch them immediately.
I consider this auspicious sign .
It is also a good thing that people from all walks of life meet me these days.
Somebody talks about cleanliness, somebody talks about education, somebody discusses social reforms.
Someone is discussing our family life being destroyed .
I think that if such a merchant comes first , he will talk to the Government about his selfishness .
But I see a major change .
They talk about their selfishness less, they talk about taking some responsibilities related to society.
These are the things that I see by adding, I am aware that we are moving forward in the direction of a very good change.
If a poor family of mine is not sick , there will never be any economic crisis in his life .
If he is healthy, he will work hard, earn and run his family.
And that is why my hygiene is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we can serve the poor better or not we cannot do dirt or not, the poor gets good.
I have also seen that those who are working in this field are sending me their success stories .
But two things came to me from my Government .
After my request the officers of H . . . Ministry felt that we should also do something .
And the officers made a plan together .
See how a change in government starts .
One he decided that if he wants to go to technical education then he has planned to give special scholarship to him by enjoying such a thousand good specialty-abled children .
I congratulate all the officers of the department for their ideas .
I had the opportunity to visit Siachen in the past .
I spent my life in the midst of the dying soldiers for the country of Diwali .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because of them, we are able to celebrate Diwali, so I went among them.
I experienced how many difficulties he lives.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say one more pride .
The youth of our country work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamity by putting a bet on life anybody gets ready to do any courage to protect us .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got an opportunity to keep a tea-water programme from the youth of our country, the youth, the youth and the sportspersons.
I got a new energy .
Their zeal, I was watching that our arrangements and facilities are very low compared to other countries, but they were talking about doing more with excitement and enthusiasm rather than complaining.
For me, the programme of tea and drink was very inspiring for these players.
On one hand, I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say it with my mind.
And I believe that the countrymen have faith in my words and trust in my intentions.
But today , once again , I want to repeat it on my behalf .
As far as black money is concerned, black money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your Principal servant, this is the Artificial of Fath for me.
The money that has gone out of the poor of India should come back by pie, this is my commitment.
There may be differences in opinion about the ways and methods.
And democracy is natural , but I assure you that we are on the right path , on the basis of what I understand and what I have .
Today, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows how much money is outside.
Everyone keeps telling different figures in their own way .
I do not want to get confused with those figures , my commitment is that there are two rupees , five rupees , crores of rupees , billions of rupees are that whichever is rude . This is the money of the poor of the country and should come back .
And I assure you , there will be no dearth of my efforts .
No action will be taken .
Just keep me blessed.
Whatever I have to do for you, whatever I have to do, I will continue to do.
I assure you this .
I have received a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, even if I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this feeling.
He has told me that you must discuss this matter in your mind .
I agree with their suffering .
Whenever I talk about the next mind, I will definitely discuss this drug addiction, this drug mafia and how big a crisis can be faced by the youth of India next time.
If you have some experience in this regard, you have some information, if you have saved the children of this addicted habit, if you have played a good role in protecting some of your government officials, if you give me any such information then I will talk to the countrymen about these good efforts and we will together create an environment in every family that no child should go on this path due to frustration, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am handling matters with which the Government comes first in the dockyard .
But how long will we hide things
I am also daring . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do so .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were saying that give us suggestions, give it on the face book, give it on Twitter, send e-mail.
But there are very large sections of the country, who don't have this, what they do.
Your point is correct .
All of them do not have this facility .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind then you listen to me on the village-village radio, then you will send a letter of mind, AIR, Parliament Street, New Delhi. If you give some suggestions then you will definitely reach me.
And I must take it seriously . Because active citizens are the biggest capital of development .
You write a letter, mean you're very active.
For the sake of my mind, your mind should also be connected.
Maybe you ' ll write a letter .
I will try, then talk to you next month.
My effort will be, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, at 11 o'clock in the day.
So I ' m going to be able to reach you .
Gradually the beginning of cold is taking place .
There is a very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijayadashmi.
My best wishes to all of you on Vijayadashmi.
I will try, if possible, I will talk to you twice a month or once in a month.
Further, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, it will be Sunday and if the time is 11 o'clock in the morning, you will also be convenient and I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in reaching my mind.
The festival of Vijayadashmi which celebrates today is a festival of victory for good on evils.
But a gentleman from Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai, he sent me a mail, he said that in Vijayadashmi we should resolve to eliminate the ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to him for his suggestion.
Everyone must think that by defeating the greater evils of ourselves, but as a nation, I feel that on the holy festival of Vijayadashmi, we all resolve to liberate from dirt and attain the victory by eliminating dirt, we can make this resolution on the festival of Vijayadashmi.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they themselves will upload their videos in social media and they will invite nine more people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, the talk of Khadi comes in very natural meditation.
You know, our scientists have successfully used Mars in the least expenditure, successfully.
There is no shortage of our strength, only we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
Swami Vivekananda often used to tell one thing.
Once, the child who had gone with the lioness had grown up now.
He said what you're doing.
You are a lion.
They have raised me.
Look at my voice, look at my conversation.
So the lion said that let me show you who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and said to him with his own face - Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am also a lion, you are a lion and as soon as the self-esteem awakened from within him, he also became a lion like that lion, a lion among the sheep.
The element within him woke up.
Swami Vivekanand ji used to say this.
My countrymen, 125 crore countrymen have immense power and immense potential.
We need to recognize ourselves.
We need to recognise the strength within us and then as Swami Vivekananda ji had said, we will walk with that self-esteem and with our true identity, we will be victorious and our nation will also be victorious and successful.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps that was a very emotional, inspiring event in my life.
God may have liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the whole nation.
Later, I was so emotionally touched that I used to do different Olympics for specialized children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come, their parents used to come, I used to go to myself.
And that is why I liked Gautam Pal's suggestions that he has given me and I felt that I should share with you all the suggestions that I have received.
A story gives me more attention.
You knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we dont stand by ourselves, even those who show the path will not be found.
We will not find the finger holders.
We will have to start the movement and I am confident that 1. 25 billion people are capable of walking, they will continue.
Many suggestions that come to me for a few days, people send big interesting suggestions.
I have been told by some people that when they start small scale industries, the process of registration should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for him.
Some people have written to me and sent children to teach skill development from fifth grade.
Someone has written to me that there should be a dust bean within every hundred meters, if there is a system of cleanliness.
Some people have written to me and sent me that polythene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I further tell you that if you send me a true event anywhere, which is positive, which inspires me, inspires the countrymen, if you send me with such true events then I will definitely talk about the mind, I will definitely bring the things that have touched my mind to the countrymen.
All this is my intention to interact with me. Come together, let us serve our Mother India.
Let us take the country to new heights.
As it comes to mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came in my mind today.
Then when I meet, I will meet on Sunday. I will meet at 11 a.m. but I believe that our journey will continue, your love will remain.
If you want to tell me something after listening to me, you must send me, I will like it.
I was very happy to talk to you today and radio. It is such a simple medium that I will be able to reach far and wide.
I will reach the poorest of the poor, because the strength of my country is in the slums of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers and sisters, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
The country will move forward with your trust.
I express my faith.
I believe in your power, so I have faith in the future of India.
Starting the talk of mind today is full of mind
10 days ago, India-Mata lost their heroic sons
These valiant heroes, we spent ourselves in protecting 1. 25 billion Indians.
The countrymen could sleep in peace, so these brave sons had kept one night and one night.
In the Pulwama terror attack, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, people across the country, and people have shock and resentment
Condolences have emerged around the martyrs and their families
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives in the defense of Mother India.
The challenge facing the country is to forget all casteism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger, stronger and decisive.
Our armed forces have always been introducing unique courage and valour .
In order to establish peace , where they have shown wonderful ability , the same attackers have also been given answers in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
The army has taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their helpers
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational words of his family have emerged through the media have further strengthened the spirit of the entire country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this hour of grief also inspires us all.
They said , They will send their second son to fight the enemies , and they will fight .
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has also tried to join his only son RP
When the body of martyr Vijay Shoren , wrapped in a tricolor , reached the ruins of Jharkhand , the innocent son said that I too would go to the army .
The sacrifice of this innocent today expresses the feeling of children and children of India
Similar feelings are being seen in the houses of our brave martyrs.
Our single brave martyr is not an exception, his family is not an exception
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the parents of Kangra's martyr Tilakraj or the six-year-old son of Shaheed Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would request the young generation to learn and understand the responsibilities shown by these families.
What is patriotism, sacrifice and tapasya, we will not need to go towards the old events of history.
These are living examples in front of our eyes and this brightness is the reason for the inspiration for the future of India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that was waiting for us till such a long time of independence is going to end.
The curiosity and curiosity of the countrymen is very natural about this.
Udupi on NarendraModiApp, Shri Omkar Shetty of Karnataka has expressed his happiness on preparing National War Memorial.
I was surprised and suffering that there was no national ar Memorial in India.
A memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there must be a memorial in the country.
We decided to build National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, i.e. on 25th February, we will deliver this national military memorial to our army.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
This new monument has been built just close to the heart of Delhi where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present.
I am confident that going to the National Military Memorial for the countrymen will be like going to a pilgrimage site.
National Sainik Memorial symbolizes the gratitude of the nation towards the supreme sacrificed soldiers after Independence
The design of the memorial displays the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers
The concept of the National Military Memorial focuses on our concentration fields, four cycles, from the birth of a soldier to martyrdom.
Amar Chakra's flame symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier
The second circle is the gallantry cycle that shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers .
It is a gallery where the bravery of soldiers on the walls has been triggered .
After this, the sacrifice cycle shows the sacrifices of the Circle soldiers.
In this , the names of the soldiers who sacrificed the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in the golden letters .
After this the protector cycle demonstrates safety
This circle has rows of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and are convincing the citizens of the country that every guard is stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe .
Overall, the National Military Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, express their gratitude and research on them.
Here is the story of the sacrifices that have sacrificed their lives for the country so that we can survive so that the country can survive and grow .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Paramilitary Forces in the development of the country
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our view that we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security .
I hope you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go, share your pictures on social media so that others get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this holy place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, for the sake of Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments keep getting me read through different means.
This time when I was reading your comment , I got a very interesting comment from Atish Mukhopadhyay ji .
He has written that on March 3, 1900, when the British had arrested Birsa Munda, his age was only 25 years old, it is a coincidence that Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also on March 3.
And he further writes that these two personalities are entirely from two different family backgrounds that enriched the legacy and history of Jharkhand .
In the matter of mind , Birsa Munda and Jamshedji are like saluting the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand in a way to pay tribute to Tata .
These two great personalities have not extended Jharkhand's name to the whole country.
The whole country is grateful for their contribution
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality for guidance, then that is Lord Birsa Munda
And the British seized them while they were asleep .
Do you know why they resorted to such cowardly action
because the British who created such a great empire were afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had shaken the British rule equipped with guns and guns only with his traditional arrows
Indeed, when people get a motivated leadership, then the collective will of the people is overwhelming on the strength of weapons.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
They did all this in their little life .
In the life of the deprived and the exploited , the sun brightens .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the age of 25
The son of Mother India like Birsa Munda has taken place in every part of the country.
Perhaps there will be a corner of India that no one has contributed in this war of independence that lasted for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize his existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave big institutions to the country
Jamshedji Tata was truly a vision, who not only saw the future of India but also laid the foundation for it.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is essential for the future.
Not only that, he also established many world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai was born on 29th February.
As you all know , this day comes once in four years .
Easy, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
In independent India , the record of presenting the highest budget in Parliament is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai .
Morarji Desai led India in a difficult time when the country's democratic fabric was at risk
Morarji Bhai Desai shook himself in the movement against emergency to protect democracy .
For this he had to pay a heavy price even in old age .
At that time the government arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
During his tenure only 44th Constitution Amendment was brought
This is important because the 42nd Amendment brought during the Emergency, which included reduction in the powers of the Supreme Court and other provisions that violated our democratic values was returned.
For example , 44th Amendment made provision for publication of proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies in newspapers .
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored. This amendment also provides that the fundamental authorities under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be violated even during the Emergency.
For the first time such arrangements were made that on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, the President would declare the Emergency and it was also decided that the period of emergency cannot be extended more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was killed in 1975 by implementing the Emergency could not be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma Awards.
Today we are moving towards a New India. In this we want to respect those who are doing their job in the grass-root level exclusively.
With their hard work, they are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
Indeed, they are true workers, who are selfless in public service, social service and above all in the national service.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who is this .
In a way, I consider it a great success because these people aren't on the front page of TV, magazine or newspapers.
They are far from the world of glare, but they are people who do not care for their name just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : Karmasu Kaushalam lives the message of the Gita in a way .
I want to tell you about a few people like this .
You must have heard about Odisha's giant hero, he is not only called Hanal Man of the Disha, but the giant hero cut the mountain with his hands in his village and made a canal for three kilometers. With his hard work, he ended the problem of irrigation and water forever.
Take Abdul Gafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job to revive the traditional pathogen painting of Kutch.
They are doing a great job of bringing this rare painting to the new generation .
The Tree of Life art work created by Abdul Ghafoor was given to former US President Barack Obama .
Among the recipients of the Padma awards, Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata.
This is a unique thing in themselves , as they spent their whole life in the service of the heavens .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and exploited through the Colongium Movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated community based small financial system
Even at the age of 100, he is training people around the world in Yoga and has so far made 1. 5 thousand people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, famously known as Lady Taran in Jharkhand, bravely worked to take iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites not only saved 50 hectares of forest but also motivated ten thousand women to unite and protect trees and wildlife.
It is the glory of Jamuna ji's hard work that today on the birth of every child, 18 trees and 10 trees are planted on the marriage of a girl.
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, even though he himself is Divya, it is difficult to get such an example for the upliftment of women with disabilities. By establishing an institution called Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, they are engaged in the virtuous work of making blind children self-reliant.
The story of the farmer's aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, that is, the story of Princess Devi is very inspiring
She has set an example in empowering women and making farming profitable.
Kisan Aunt added 300 women from their area to the Self Help Group and motivated them to make economically self-reliant
He trained the women of the village along with farming and other means of employment. The special thing is that they have done the work of connecting technology with agriculture and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time that the Padma Awards given this year have received Padma awards to 12 farmers.
Usually very few people associated with agriculture and very few people who do direct farming have come to the list of Padma Shri .
This is a living picture of changing India in itself.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk to you about a heart touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Nowadays, wherever I am going, my endeavor is to meet some beneficiaries of PM-JAY-PM Jan Arogya Yojana.
He was treated with this scheme and he became healthy and he became the head of the house, he became a victim of hard work and he was unable to work for his family. This scheme benefited him and he became healthy again.
Brothers and sisters, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big a change is coming in the life of the poor .
If you all know any poor person who is unable to get treatment because of lack of money , tell him about this scheme .
Different education boards across the country will initiate the process for examination of boards of Class  and II in the next few weeks
I extend my warm greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who take the exams.
A few days ago, a very big event was held at the Format of Town Fall in Delhi.
One of the special features of the Exam Pe Charge was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination .
There are many aspects which can certainly be beneficial for the students .
If all the students, their teachers, parents can see the recording of this entire programme on YouTube, then greet all my exam warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, this cannot be the case with India or with regard to festivals.
There is hardly any day in our country which has no significance, which has no festival
because we have this legacy of thousands of years old culture
After a few days the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday then its special significance is felt in our temple .
He discussed many topics and his self - confidence was really impressive .
During the interaction, when I was talking to a pragmatic young man, he said, "I am a stage artist, I mimicry in entertainment programmes, so I asked whom do you mimicry
So he told me that I mimicry the Prime Minister
So I said to him , " Show me a little bit , and it was a pleasant surprise for me . " So he did his entire mimicry in the way I speak of my mind , and he spoke of mymicry .
I was glad to hear that people hear not only the words of the mind , but also remember it on many occasions .
I was really impressed by the power of that divyang young man
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to join you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through radio , I ' m coming from millions of families every month .
Many times talking to you, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on your phone, I feel that you have accepted me as part of your family.
It has been a very pleasant experience for me
Friends, election is the biggest festival of democracy
Next two months, we'll all be busy in the fray for elections
I myself will also be a candidate in this election
Respecting the healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May.
That is, with the strength of your blessings after the election, once again through the words of the mind, I will start talking to you and I will keep talking to you for years.
Once again I thank all of you very much
Shri Sivakumar Swami ji, Doctor of Shri Siddhaganga Math in Tumkur district in Karnataka has not been among us
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us Kayakwe Kailas i.e. to perform his obligation while working hard, is like being in the residence of Lord Shiva, Kailash Dham
His reputation was as a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer
He put his whole life in the way that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
In every way the welfare of the farmers was a priority in the life of Swami ji.
Siddhaganga Math regularly organised animal and agricultural fairs .
I have often got the privilege of receiving the blessings of the supreme lord Swamiji .
In 2007, our former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam visited Tumkur on the occasion of Centenary Year Celebrations of Shri Shivkumar Swami ji.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for the lord of God on this occasion .
This poem of Dr Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math beautifully.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
The EC was the foundation day on 25th January, which is celebrated as National Voters Day.
It is natural for every countryman to be proud of the Election Commission by seeing the scale organised in India.
No work is left in our country to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, has a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote
It is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission when they hear these things .
Keeping in mind that one voter, that voter gets an opportunity to exercise his franchise, the entire team of EC employees goes to far-flung areas and arranges voting - that is the goodness of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continued efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all security personnel, other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that young people born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders .
Now they are going to be part of the decision making process in the country
It's time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the young generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to vote .
It is my duty to vote together - this feeling should flourish within us
For any reason in life, if you are unable to vote, there should be great pain
Sometimes there should be some misunderstanding in the country
I urge the celebrities of the country to create awareness amongst the people by running a campaign to ensure that we are all together to voter registration or to vote on the day of polling.
I hope a large number of young people will be registered as voters and their participation will further strengthen our democracy
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some amazing, unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is polygamous
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I got the privilege of inaugurating a Museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You know that many such rooms, buildings were closed since independence within the Red Fort.
The rooms of the closed Red Fort have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and IITs.
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history lies.
The stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the ramparts of the museum inspires us to enter into history.
At the same place, the brave sons of Bharat Maa Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillo and Major General Shahnawaz Khan were prosecuted by the British Government.
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji at the Red Fort, at the Kranti Mandir, I met Netaji's family members with a very special cap, cap.
Netaji used to wear the same hat
I kept that cap in the museum, so that the people coming there should also see that cap and take inspiration from it for patriotism.
Indeed , the valour and patriotism of its heroes needs to be brought differently to the new generation again and again .
Just a month ago on 30 December I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands .
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because it is the tradition on 15th August.
This was the occasion to complete 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organiser
A brave soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom
Let's go to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian
For many years it has been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do this thing.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence
Together we talked a lot about Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhash Bose
I am glad that many places associated with the great heroes of India have been developed in Delhi .
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir connected with Baba Saheb Ambedkar
If you come to Delhi you must visit these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too, I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered radio as an important means of connecting with people. Similarly, Netaji also had a deep connection with radio and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations also broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The programmes broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes gave great strength to the warriors of our freedom struggle .
A museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir .
This is an attempt to tell Indian art and culture very attractively .
There are 4 historical exhibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works of three centuries old .
Excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloz Mukherjee have been exhibited in the museum
And I specially urge you to go there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
Now you might be wondering that art is happening here and I am talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore .
You still have to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as an author and a musician .
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to most of his works
He believed that the person who sees his painting himself understands that painting, know the message given by him in the painting from his perspective.
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, in Russia and in the United States.
I hope you will definitely visit their paintings in the Kranti Mandir
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
There was such a saint - Saint Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on February 19
The twins of Sant Ravidas ji are very famous .
Sant Ravidas ji used to offer greater messages through a few lines .
He said that there is a caste in caste, which can not be added to the people of Ketan, unless the caste is split on the banana stem, then the leaf under the leaves and in the end nothing comes out, but the whole tree is over, in the same way humans have been divided into castes and humans have not been.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, then it is not appropriate to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi .
Sant Ravidas ji through his messages tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life
It will not be wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of labour prestige to the world .
He used to say that if your mind and heart are sacred then God in your heart lives .
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced the people of every section, whether the Maharaja of Chittor or the queen of Meerabai or all of them were his followers.
I once again bow down to Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight the aspects of Indias space programme and its future.
He also wants me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think further than the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your ideas and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad where I got the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space program contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching space.
The Kalam set created by our students on 24th January has been launched
Sounding rockets created by university students in Odisha have also made several records.
The Space Mission has been started in the last four years since the independence of the country till 2014.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft
We will soon register Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign
Our country is also using space technology to protect lives.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, space technology is getting a lot of help in all these.
NAI devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which is helpful in their safety as well as in economic growth.
We are using space technology to improve the delivery and accountability of government services
Housing for All, Housing for All, about 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been geo-tagged in this scheme.
Along with this, about three and a half million properties were also geo-tagged under MNREGA.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It has a great contribution in our better relations with many countries of the world .
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has given a gift of development to our neighbouring friendly countries.
Through its extremely competitive launch services, India today launches satellites not only of developing countries but also of developed countries.
The sky and stars are always very attractive for children .
Our space program gives children the opportunity to think big and move beyond those boundaries which were considered impossible till now.
This is a vision for our children to watch stars as well as to inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that all the young and young players who have played this time in Khelo India have come forward.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports will be strengthened i. e.
This time players from every state have performed well at their own level in Khelo India.
The life of many medal winners is inspiring .
They live in a parking shed with their family
At the same time, the captain of the Under-21 women's kabaddi team of Maharashtra, Sonali Helvi is from Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother promoted the skill of Sonali
It is often seen that daughters do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi
Despite this, Sonali chose kabaddi and performed excellently
Asansol's 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw is the youngest gold medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games
Akshata Baswani Kamti, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka wins gold medal in weightlifting
He credited his victory to his father, his father is a farmer in Belgaum
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is a New India of the resolve of youth power.
These stories of Khelo India are telling that people of not only big cities have contributed to the creation of a New India, but also the youth and children coming from small towns, villages and towns, have a huge contribution.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty contests.
But have you heard about the toilet shining contest
Over 50 lakh toilets have also participated in this unique contest lasting nearly a month.
The name of this unique contest is clean beautiful toilets
People are making their toilets clean as well as colouring them and making some paintings. You will also be able to see all the photos social media from Kashmir to Kanyakumari from Kutch to Kamrup.
I call upon all Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in our Panchayat

Today, in collaboration with the people of India, India is looking forward to open defecation long before 2nd October, 2019 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat have also contributed a lot in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat and that is why you are happy to share that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and sanitation coverage in rural India has crossed 98 and toilets have been provided to nearly nine crore families.

Here he demonstrated his firmness towards justice .
Today, I would like to say that one thing that touches my mind in the eedback of Mann Ki Baat, the maximum people said that when we listen to the mindset of all the people of the family then it seems that the head of our family is sharing our own words with us when I heard it widely that I am from you, I am from you, I am from you, I am from you, you have made me bigger and in a way I will continue to join you as a member of your family, I will continue to join you again and again and again with your words of mind.
