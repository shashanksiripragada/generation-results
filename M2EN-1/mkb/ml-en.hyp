Mann Ki Baat 2019 October
My dear countrymen, you are greeted.
Today is Diwali's holy day.
At present, Diwali is being celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special feature of this festival is that not only the Indian community but also the governments of many countries, citizens and socio-economic organizations of the country celebrate Diwali with joy and joy.
Thus, there is a microcosm of India.
Friends, Tourism Festival in the world is an attraction for tourism.
In our country, every region has its own diversity, and people from other countries are particularly interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something different for this Diwali in the last Mann Ki Baat.
I used to say: Come, let us celebrate Diwali this time, the women power and achievements of India, that is, we should respect Laxmi of India.
Immediately, stories of inspiring in the social media appeared very much.
My mother is my strength.
My mother took responsibility for five children when my father died in 1990.
Today we have five brothers in good work.
My blessings to your mother.
Geetaswamy, who is active in Hindi, says that she has been led by the people of Assam Rifles, the daughter of the bus conductor, Major Kushboo Kanwar, Bharat Lakshmi.
Kavita Tiwari has her daughter Bharatlaxmi and her own strength.
She's very proud that her daughter is a good artist.
The daughter got a good rank in the CAT exam.
Megha Jain writes about a 92-year-old man who has been distributing free meals at Gualior Railway Station for years.
Meghalaya, the humility and compassion of this Laxmi is a great inspiration.
People shared many such stories.
You must read, inspire and share what you have...
The emotion of that poetry is a consciousness that the words of that poem have been written in the seventeenth century about what we say now.
The greatest words, the greatest imagination, the greatest thought of this poem in the leaflet.
Pinnida Parmegongdon, who sacrificed his daughter Bhrigu on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Jasulidan... because of his daughter Parvati, Bhrigumuni was famous because of his daughter Lakshmi.
Our daughters are our pride.
Our society has a strong personality, a bright future because of the glory of these daughters.
Dear countrymen, on 12 November 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I can never forget what I went to the gurudwaras of Vancouver and Tehran.
I have many things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev who can share with you, but it will require several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stood firm against many evils like that.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji brought his message to the world far away.
He was the first to travel in those days.
He went to many places and enjoyed everybody with his laziness, humility and behavior like a common man.
The great religious journey of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is called Udasi.
With a message of harmony and equality, he visited north, south, east and west, and witnessed people, sages and sages everywhere.
It is believed that the famous saint of Assam, Shankerdev, has inspired him.
Rajgir, associated with Buddhism, went to holy places like Gaya.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has gone to Sri Lanka in Southern India.
During the journey to Beedar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is a famous place in Bihar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji .
During a journey like this Guru Nanak ji had travelled in Kashmir and surroundings in northern India.
It has established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet and the people of that place considered him a Guru.
He is also a priest in Uzbekistan.
As part of his visit, he has also visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He holds a place in the minds of millions of people and follows his advice with due respect.
A few days ago, diplomatic representatives from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which was the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
The diplomats also had the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple and to know about Sikh traditions and culture.
After that, many Ambassadors also shared pictures there in the social media and wrote about good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember October 31.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the birthplace of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel had the ability to assimilate the people, and also emotionally compete with those with discriminatory opinion.
Sardar Patel has seen and studied every small thing in depth.
He was indeed a personality of hunger.
It was also good for the organization.
He was skilled in formulating plans and improving the war strategy.
While reading and listening about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, he will be able to understand how deep his preparations were.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country participated in the Congress Mela in Ahmedabad in 1921.
He was responsible for all arrangements related to the Mahasam festival.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
I'm sure nobody has a problem with the water.
He spoke to the farmers and asked them to make Khadi bags.
Farmers made a bag and sold it to the representatives.
Representatives have no fear of stealing shoes because of their shoes in these bags.
On the other hand, there was a lot of increase in Khadi sales.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution.
He spoke of the greatness of ensuring Mauli rights, thereby ensuring a variety of variations in the caste-modern region.
Friends, as the first Interior Minister of India, Sardar Patel has done a very hard work and history of uniting the nations.
It was Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty to note everything.
In 1947, our neighbour's eyes fell on the island of Lakshadweep, and they shipped there with the flag of that country.
With this attention, Sardar Patel, without losing any time, has initiated drastic action.
He directed the brothers of Arkot Ramaswamy, Arkot Laxmanaswamy, to bring the people from Thiruvananthapuram to Lakshadweep and to raise the Tri-World Flag in Lakshadweep.
Soon there was a tri-flag flew, and the neighbourhood of Lakshadweep's neighbourhood was devastated.
After this incident, the brothers and sisters of Sardar Patel have been instructed to ensure that all necessary help is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep plays an important role in the development of India.
This is an attractive tourist destination.
I hope you all visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, I had dedicated the Statue of Unity to Sardar Patel for the nation and the world.
It's the tallest statue in the world.
For the double height of the US Statue of Liberty.
Every Indian is proud of the tallest statue in the world.
Every Indian is proudly elevated.
You will be happy to note that more than 26 lakh visitors have visited the Statue of Unity within a year.
The people there have started farming of dragon fruits and I believe that it will become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a study.
We are witness to how a place is developed as a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There people from all over the country and abroad.
Several arrangements are being developed on their own after travel facilities, housing, guides, environment friendly arrangements etc.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, no Indian should be proud of the fact that the Time Magazine has given the Statue of Unity a great place in the world's top 100 tourist destinations.
I hope you all go to see the Statue of Unity for a while from your precious time.
However, my request to all Indians who find time for the journey must go to at least 15 tourist destinations and stay at night.
Friends, as you know, from 2014 to 31st October every year, we are celebrating political loneliness.
On this day, we send a message to protect our country's unity, integrity and security at any cost.
On 31st October, we are also organizing a formal unit like every time.
It will be attended by all sections of the society, at all levels.
It is a symbol of this country that the Red For Unity is going in the same direction and wants to achieve the same goal.
Likewise, there is a special interest and zeal in the recent fight between the people.
The phone unit is also a beautiful opportunity.
Running is beneficial for mind and brain and body.
Therefore, not only for the body but also for the unity of the mind and cultural India and for the new heights of India...
So, if you live in any city, you can find out where the phone for unit is going.
I hope you all will definitely run for India's unity and your fitness on October 31.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has called for unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, our society was always very active and cautious to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around, there are many examples of persistent efforts to enhance mutual harmony.
But often the problems of the society, its contributions and the rapid disappearance of memories.
A lot of people in a variety of ways went to the field.
What kind of parties were playing games to gain in their own way from around
What kind of language is spoken to warm the atmosphere
Efforts have been made to stir up different sounds.
We remember what some plaintiffs and some phrases said to be self-supporting and what irresponsible things have been said.
While honouring the court's emergence with immense pride, there is no way to create an atmosphere of warmth and pressure on society anywhere.
We have to remember these things forever, which gives us immense strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of duty.
This is an example of how strong the voice of unity gives the country.
It was a major setback for the country.
Today, I pay my homage to that great woman.
My dear countrymen, if you hear a story of every village far away, if you can hear a story from every village, from the north to the south, from the east to the west, in every corner of India, then it is about cleanliness.
Every individual, every family, every village, every village, is inspired to have their own comfortable experience of cleanliness because this effort for cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
There are 125 crore Indians who have the right to accomplish it.
But it's a comfortable and attractive experience.
I guess I heard you too.
The world's highest battlefield is 50-60 degrees mines.
There's only a place called oxygen in the air.
It is a great adventure to live in the midst of such challenges in such a negative situation.
Our brave-hearts are not only waiting for our borders in such an entirely contradictory environment, but also performing a Swachh Siachen programme.
We know these Siachen glaciers are the source of rivers and water.
Therefore, in order to undertake a cleanliness campaign here, it means to ensure clean water for those living in the valleys and they use water in rivers like Nubra, Shyok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is an opportunity to awaken the spirit of our people.
If you do it, you buy something new, and bring something from the market, it's going on in the family at least.
I once told you to try to buy local goods.
If we get the things we need in our village then we don't have to go to Taluk.
I don't need to go to the district if I get to Talluq.
The more we try to buy local goods, the more Gandhi 150 himself becomes a great opportunity.
We have to buy something that has been supplied by the hands of our neighbours and shaped our minerals.
I urge you to buy local items with the good wishes of Diwali.
Look, we can see how great we can play to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes the cause of inconvenience is a fire.
There may be burns.
I appeal to all of you to control yourself and celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.
Many good wishes.
Thank you very much.
Man Ki Batt, September 2018
No Indian will be proud of the soldiers of our army about our armed forces.
Every Indian, in any region, in any species or in any language, is always enthusiastic to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, the hundred and fifty crore people of India celebrated the day of the invasion of our army with pride.
We recalled the surgical strike in 2016, when our soldiers responded to those who were arrogantly arrogant in the face of terrorism against our nation.
More and more citizens of the country, particularly the younger generation, have organised our armed exhibitions in different parts of the country with the idea of knowing what our strength is.
Our soldiers wanted to know how capable we are and how we can save our lives and save our people.
The day like Parakram Parva reminds youngsters about the proud tradition of our Armed Forces.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
It is certain that our army will respond to those who try to ignore the atmosphere of peace in our country.
India is always committed to commitment and commitment to peace.
In the twentieth century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace in the two world wars.
And remember that we had nothing to do with that war.
It was an attack by our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the most peacekeeping nations of the United Nations.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmets for decades.
My dear countrymen, things in the sky are different.
On October 8, we are celebrating Air Force Day.
I congratulate all the air warriors and their families for their service to the nation from the depths of the heart.
In 1947, when the invaders from Pakistan launched an unprecedented attack, the Air Force ensured that Indian soldiers and warplanes have reached the battlefield at the right time to rescue Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
No one knows about the 1971 Bangladesh Freedom Fight.
The role of the Air Force is ineffective in relieving Cargil from the mercenaries in 1999.
In the Tiger Hill, the enemy's bases were bombed and air force dumped them.
I am grateful to the Air Force for the satisfactory actions taken by our Air Force, whether it is risky or risky.
India can proudly say that in the Indian Army, not only the strength of men in the Armed Forces, but also the strength of women.
How to save Tommy was disturbed by the country.
You know Abhilash Tommy is a very brave hero.
He is the first Indian to the world with a small boat without the help of a modern technology alone.
For the past 80 days, he was on his way to the ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Sea, but the terrible ocean storm created him an accident.
But this valour of the Indian Navy has been fighting the sea for several days.
He stayed in the midst of the sea without eating and drinking.
I don't agree to a failure to life.
I spoke on the telephone when Abhilash was saved from the sea, a wonderful example of courage, determination and transition.
His courage, determination, determination and the power to overcome and succeed will certainly inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, everyone knows what is the significance of October 2 for our nation.
On 2nd October this year, there is a greater significance.
From now on, for two years, we are going to organize various events across the world as a hundred and fifty winner of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis thoughts have inspired the whole world.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was strengthened, he revived the thoughts and prepared a new version.
His thoughts have been placed in front of the people about the rights of the renowned Bapu farmers, the villages and the workers, and many issues such as cleanliness, education etc.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
The revered Bapu was a mass organiser.
It was his characteristic that he wanted to join people and join them.
This is one of the greatest personalities of his personality.
He convinced every person that he is the greatest and most important person in the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle is that he made it a massive democracy.
According to Mahatma Gandhis call on the freedom struggle, all sections of the society and all sections of the society have dedicated themselves.
Gandhiji says, I am giving you a mantra.
You'll feel that your senses don't work without dignity.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is even greater today.
Today, we have to think of one thing on the basis of the growing middle class in the country, their growing economic strength and growing credibility.
Can we remember the revered Bapu for a moment when we go to buy something
Can you remember the spell of a revered father
Can you imagine what kind of citizen of the country will benefit from the things I buy
Whose face will be happy
Who will be directly or indirectly benefited by buying it
If the poorest of the poor is able to avail, I would be more happy.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji, I believe that a small step in the life of the poorest and the weakest person will make a big difference.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that if he cleans the premises, he might not even know how it was.
But it happened, India got freedom.
Similarly, with a small activity, the economic growth of my country, the economic empowerment and the power of fighting against poverty, we feel that we have a big contribution.
But I believe that if I can do that, it will be the real patriot of today's era.
It is said that Lal Bahadur used to keep the old and distorted clothes of the scientific Khadi, because somebody's superstition is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes are very smooth, and each of these pieces will benefit.
This emotion filled with tea for the country and love for the people of the country was filled with a small, lengthy glory.
After two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientific Ji along with Puja Bapu.
When the name of scientific science comes, the Indian diaspora will shine in our minds.
His harmonious personality is always a matter of pride for the people.
Besides, he could see that he was extremely humble, but he had a strong personality like a mountain.
His vision of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan shows his immense personality.
In reflection of his selfless penance towards the nation, he gave the mantra to bring the soldiers and farmers of the country to the peak of victory in a short span of about a year and a half.
People from all over the country are associated with this effort of 15th fire.
If you didn't make a phone call on this issue, people associated with cleanliness wouldn't have noticed that this kind of comfort has happened to you after the toilet.
I want to thank you especially for phone calls.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention on 2nd October 2018 will mark the commencement of the centenary celebrations of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there is a quote in Sanskrit: 'Naya ka na raj syat'.
The Constitution of Baba Saheb Ambedkar has created several provisions to protect the basic rights of the poor.
In his vision, on October 12, 1993, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed.
Beyond a few days, the Commission is completing its 25 years.
The Human Rights Commission not only defended human rights but also increased human dignity.
Our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, has clearly stated that humanity is not an inseparable imagination.
In this 25-year journey, this institution has created an ideal and trustworthy environment among the people.
I think this is a very lucky event for the best democratic values of a healthy society.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been set up in 26 states, including national level human rights activities.
As a society, we need to understand human rights and bring it into action. This is the basis of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, the development of everyone along with everyone.
Dear countrymen, if Jayaprakash Narayan's birthday comes in October, cannot remember him if he starts the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijayraje Sindh.
These great personalities are very inspiring for us, we bow down to them.
Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary is 31st October, but for a few years Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the Run for Unity is held in all small towns of Hindustan, in villages, in the streets as a race for unity.
This year, we have to organize a software unit in our villages, streets, cities and cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
Our endeavour should be to ensure that all sections of the society, all sections of the society, and all sections of the country, at the grassroots of unity, through the 31st October For Unity programme.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
Many good wishes to all people on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan is considered as a symbol of mutual affection and trust of brothers and sisters.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories enshrined in the hearts of the people of two different countries and religions.
Now in a few days, the birth anniversary is being celebrated.
Best wishes to all the people, to their parents and to their families.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated on a cultural day.
I congratulate all those who have grown up on this great legacy and reach out to the common people.
We are very proud of the fact that Tamil is the oldest language in the world and has played a very big role in the propagation of Sanskrit language and wisdom since the Vedic period.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village in Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking in cultural languages.
That's why in any microscopic sense or even the subject can be explained exactly.
At the same time, it is easy to understand that it is related to our soil and our tradition.
For example, to convince the glory of the Guru in life: "Ekmastu Guru Shishya Prince Prabhavathivam Nasti Tadavrim, Yad-Datwariani Bhavet.
We commemorate Radhakrishnan, the Supreme Court.
His birth anniversary is celebrated throughout the country as teachers.
I extend my greetings to all teachers of the country on the eve of Teachers Day.
At the same time, I appreciate your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, our hard-working farmers come here with new hopes.
Rain brings relief to plants and trees and dry water bodies in the horrible summer.
But sometimes they come along with the ruined and ruined flood.
It is natural that there is more rain than it can be found somewhere.
We have already seen that the horrific floods in Kerala have severely affected the lives of the people.
Today, in this difficult situation, the entire country is with Kerala.
We feel compassionate with those who lost their own.
Though we cannot solve the lost lives, we want to assure the unhappy families that the hundred twenty-five crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with your shoulders during this grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity will recover at the earliest.
I am sure that Kerala will rise due to the enthusiasm and indomitable courage of the people.
Damage to accidents is unfortunate.
But we can see a lot of vision of humanity in the hour of trouble.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something in their own way, wherever there is an accident, whether it is in Kerala or in any other state of Hindustan or in district or district.
Every age and every workforce play their own role.
The people of Kerala are ensuring their share of the sufferings and their grief.
We know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are leading rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save the flood victims.
My dear countrymen, this time Mann Ki Baat's suggestions were checked.
More people from all over the country, the issue of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, our dear brothers and sisters.
Kirti from Gaziaabad, Swati from Sonipa, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swap Banerjee from West Bengal, Ashish Pande from Katihar in Bihar and others asked Prime Minister Modi to write on Mobile App and MyGov about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
On August 16, when the country and the world heard Atal ji's death, it was sad.
14 years ago, the Prime Minister deserved the nation.
In a way, he has been away from active politics for the past 10 years.
There was no place in the news, it wasn't seen in public life.
The gap of 10 years is very big, but the country and the world have seen since August 16 that the ten-year period in the minds of the common man of India has not even made a minute difference.
What kind of affection and respect was with Atal ji, however sad the nation was, it shows his vast personality.
India will be borrowed to Atal ji in the name of the first Constitution Amendment in 2003.
This change has made two major changes in Indian politics.
Firstly, the size of the Cabinets in the States has been fixed at 15 of the total number of subscriptions.
On the other hand, the limit set by the law of deregulation has been reduced to three to two.
Also, clear guidelines have been set for the party to disqualify.
Over the years, there has been a comprehensive political culture in India, which has created large ministries, not to divide the departments, but to please the political leaders.
Atalji changed it.
His move was waiting for money and resources.
And more efficiency.
This transformation has led to a long vision of a person like Atal ji and our political culture and healthy habits have grown.
Atalji was a perfect patriot.
During his reign, the time for the presentation of the budget was changed.
Previously, the paper was published at 5:00 p.m. following the tradition of the British, because it was time to start the Parliament in England.
During the presentation of the Atalji Budget in 2001, it moved 5 p.m. to 11.
One more freedom - the Indian Flag Code was built during the reign of Atal ji and it was authorized in 2002.
The Departments included the National Flag Flag at public places.
It's a good thing, good for democracy.
It will be a good tribute to Atal ji for healthy democracy, good democracy, good habits and striving to strengthen democracy, and taking forward the discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a developed and prosperous India, I salute Atal ji for all.
A few days ago, the Parliament session ended.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha (Productivity) is 118 percent of the Rajya Sabhas 74 percent.
The Lok Sabha has passed 21 bills and 14 bills in the Rajya Sabha as a result of the efforts of all members to make the annual session more effective than the party's interest.
This year's session of Parliament will be remembered as a conclave for social justice and for the welfare of the youth.
In this conference, great bills that benefit the youth and the backward communities were passed.
For decades, there was a need to create an OBC commission like a Scheduled Tribe Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has concluded this time the decision to form the OBC Commission and gave it constitutional authority.
This move will become one of the goals of social justice.
The Bill also passed the Amendment Bill for the Rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
This law will provide greater protection to the good of the Scheduled Tribes.
At the same time, it will prevent criminals from committing injustice, and the pulse will fill the pillars with confidence.
No society of injustice and culture can bear against women power in the country.
The country is not ready to bear the criminals who commit adultery.
Therefore, the Parliament Penal Code passed the Amendment Bill and ensured strict punishment.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago that the unauthorized child was sentenced to two months' imprisonment in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial for five days and sentenced the convicts to death.
The court in Rajasthan has also made a quick decision.
This law will play a crucial role in preventing crimes against women and adults.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
However, it was not possible to finish this session of the Rajya Sabha and I assure the Muslim women that the entire country stands for justice to them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the parties of the country on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, the attention of crores of people is now being paid to the Asian Games in Government.
Every day in the morning, people first in the newspapers, television, news, social media, which Indian sportsperson has won medals.
Asian games are still going on.
Congratulations to all the medal winners for the nation.
Our girls have a lot of medals for the country, this is a very positive sign.
Young sportspersons with medals are 15-16 years old.
It is a good sign that most of the medal winners live in small streets and villages, who have achieved this success through hard work.
I once again congratulate the medal winners of the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good show.
Many good wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Namaskar Bhavnaji, I respect the child's views.
We have seen the construction of houses and buildings with stones and rocks, but can you imagine the construction of an excellent, large and wonderful temple of a single rock about 1200 years ago, perhaps it would be difficult to imagine.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this incredible balance of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Rani ki wav, built in the eleventh century at Pan in Gujarat, will surprise anyone.
India's land was an engineering laboratory.
He is India's Dr.
M.
In that part of the country, he is a priest, and the rest of the country remembers him very respectfully and confidently.
In his memory, September 15 is being celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have shown their different personality all over the world.
Now, when we celebrate Engineer's Day, we have to think about the future.
There must be workshops.
Recently, the Disaster Management has become a big issue.
The world is facing natural calamities.
In this situation, what kind of structural engineering should be
How can we predict the construction of waste without waste
We have to think of many such things when we celebrate the Engineering Day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Sometimes the rain shows the joys of India due to its richness and diversity.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
Twenty-two children, a football player in Thailand, were taken to the cave while their coach was driven.
There's a few hours to go inside and get out of the cave.
Because they couldn't find any other way, they took refuge on a small rock inside the cave - that's not a day or two, 18 days.
If you see death in front of the children, you can imagine what would be the moments when they have to live with it every moment.
On the one hand, they faced the danger, on the other hand, the human values of the world were mixed together.
People all over the world were praying for these children safely.
But at the end of the good news, the world was quiet, happy.
But I feel like seeing this incident in another way.
Everyone joined the mission as a team.
I think it's a matter of learning and understanding the behaviour of everyone.
In this endeavour, a young soldier from Thailand's navy had to sacrifice his life.
It is surprising for the world that despite such a terrible climate, they did not expect so much courage and forgiveness in a dark cave full of water.
It shows that wonders happen when humanity gathers together.
Respect, faith, determination and self-confidence were the speciality of the poems of Sage ji.
Everything that we have said to the Indians is very powerful and inspiring.
It must be dark.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid homage to Sh.
Namaste Prime Minister, my name is truth.
I have been the first year student in Delhi University this year.
During our school board exams, you talked about the tension and education of the exams, what is your message to students like me
July and August are very important for the farmers and for the youth.
'Cause it's a pack season for colleges.
It's time for millions of youngsters like the truth to go to college.
It is time to play holidays in April and wait for the results, decide the directions in life and choose the career.
Children come from the shadow of their parents to the shadow of professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy from the beginning of their life.
For the first time, he has to go out of the house and go out of the village and get out of a safe environment and become a regulator.
So many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a new sense of life.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will be prepared to join.
I want to tell you that be calm, enjoy life, enjoy life and enjoy the spirit of inner life.
There's no choice but books, no learning, but the habit of finding new things.
The value of old friends is very big.
Children's friends are immense, but the finding and making of new friends must be carefully taken care of in their own way.
Learn something new, acquire new skills, learn new languages.
Now, while talking about the season, a student from a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh was witnessing how Asharam Choudhary survived the challenging challenges of life.
There are so many students from the poor family, from the challenged environment, who have done inspiring things through their own self-sacrifice and dedication.
Prince Kumar of Delhi, the father of DTC, and Abhay Gupta, who studied under the Street Light on the footpath of Kolkata, and the daughter of Afreen Shaikh of Ahmedabad, the father's autorickshaw driver, are also felicitating the daughter Khushi of Nagpur, the school bus driver, and Kartik of Hariana, the father's guardian, and Jarkhand's admirers.
If we look around, we can see a lot of examples like this.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives strength and inspiration to my mind.
I was talking to the Indian youth in Sanjos City, once known as the Technology Hub in America.
I asked them to think about how they can use their capabilities for India and do something in time.
I asked to turn brain drain into brain gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahabji and Rajneesh Vajpayee have made a different effort by accepting this challenge.
With his professional skill, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together prepared a smart guide.
This App not only connects the people of the village to the world, but also makes them aware of any information and information on their own mobile phones.
The villagers of Taudhkpur village in Rai Barelli, the village head, district magistrate and CDO inspired people to use this app.
In this App village, it is a matter of bringing about a digital revolution in a way that all the developments in the village, record, track, monitor and monitor everything is easy through this App.
In this app, the village's phone director, news section, indus list, health center and information center are all available.
The App is very beneficial for the farmers, the App's Grameen Feature is being used as a market for their produce in a way.
If you look at this incident, you will be able to see that the young man lives in America in all his lifestyles and thoughts, he will leave India several years ago, but he knows the cornerstone of his village, understands the challenges and emotional linkages with the village.
But sometimes due to lack of time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes the slight slope of the spectacles swells on it due to the surroundings, but if a tiny slope touches it, everything appears once more, it takes time to the past.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
Of course, Parpur Warri is a very amazing journey.
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is being celebrated on July 23 this year.
Parpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Approximately 15-20 days before the congratulations of Asha, the pilgrims are walking on foot with teeth.
Millions of youngsters are participating in this journey known as Vari.
Pilgrims reach there for the vision of Lord Vishnu, who is called Bhagwadhobaya and Panduranga.
Lord Vishnu preserves the good of the poor and the deprived and the persecuted.
People from places like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have great respect and devotion.
It is a different experience to go to the Villithoba Temple in Pampur and its magnificence, beauty and spiritual joy.
If I get a chance to tell the listeners of Manki Baat, I surely want to join the Parpur Wari once.
Innumerable sanctuaries like Jnaneshwar, Namadev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are providing information to the common people even today in Maharashtra.
This tradition of sages continues to inspire every corner of Hindustan.
The message of harmony, love and compassion is received from all concerned practices.
With respect to blind dignity, we get the mantra to fight the society.
The world-class dare and self-confidence.
He had the power and wisdom to show the British rulers their fault.
The British feared him as they tried to commit treason three times in 20 years.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present an interesting story to you about Lokmanya Tilak and an idol in Ahmedabad.
During this journey, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to talk to him about 40,000 people who reached Ahmedabad in October 1916, about a hundred years ago.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed by the world leader.
Naturally, the british were dissatisfied with this, and the collector continued to admit it.
Sardar Saheb Saheb Saheb Saheb, who was firmly committed to abandoning his position, was determined to establish a world-class leader's idol.
The statue was finally constructed and on 28 February 1929, it was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi.
Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of the World Head.
The Ganesh festival was celebrated with traditional respect and festivities and became a powerful medium of social awareness, social integrity, integrity and equality among the people.
It was a period of time to fight against the British in the country.
It is obvious that even today our younger generation is interested in this and our ancient heritage and our heroes of history.
Today, you can see the Ganesh Mandaps in all the cities and streets.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn about leadership and organisational sentiments and develop their capabilities.
This time, from the statue of Ganeshji, all the decorations must be environment friendly and must be a competition for environment friendly Ganesh Festival in all cities.
I'll surely get all this to people.
The world-class thinker has made himself self-confidence among the people, becomes a printer, the Swaraj is our birthright, and will achieve it.
Even today, it is time to say that we will achieve ourselves.
There should be good results for all Indians, for good governance and development.
This is the building of a new India.
50 years after the birth of Tilak, on the same day, on 23rd July, another son of Bharatamba was born.
He sacrificed his life, assuming that we should breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
There will be a young man in India who cannot be inspired by these lines. Many youngsters like Sarfarashi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Me Haidekhana Hi George Kithana, Baju-e-Kaatte Meam Hai, Ashfaq Udah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad have been inspired by them.
The courage of Chandrashekhar Azad, his enthusiasm for freedom has become an inspiration for many youngsters.
Asad lived, but never bowed his head before foreign rule.
A few days ago, the Junior Under 20 World Organic Championships held in Finland created history by achieving the gold medal by the brave women and farmers of India in a 400-meter race race.
Answering my letter to fear another daughter alone, she sent me an e-mail reporting from Indonesia that preparations for Asian Games are going on.
I am proud that I am proud that the greatest minute in the life of any ultimate person is the triangular minute.
Ekta, we're all proud of it.
The name of the solitary country is enlightened.
World Para Athletic Grant Pre-2018 in Tunisia has achieved Gold and Venkata Medals.
I convey my best wishes to you all for your bravery.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the centuries-old festivals in this month of August, which will give you good health and patriotism.
Once again, let's gather in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have clearly understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Both teams performed well in this game.
Bowler Rashid Khan from Afghanistan also performed well in IPL this year.
I remember, the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, has taken a dig at me and said, The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rasheed Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for preparing a platform for our sportspersons to express their talent.
Rashid Khan represents big players in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done one thing as a model all over the world.
When the Indian team bought the trophy, the Afghan team called for the first time in the international competition and took photographs together.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will be participating in sports with each other's best sportsman spirit.
Dear Countrymen, the fourth Yoga Day on June 21 is a different sight.
To see the whole world becomes one.
The soldiers of India and China together performed Yoga on the high snow storm in Ladakh.
Yoga works to unite people by breaking all the borders.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from more than 100 countries have made this festival a big festival without caste, religion, region, color and women.
It is natural for people from all over the world to have a double enthusiasm in India while participating in Yoga Day events with such enthusiasm.
It is a matter of pride for the country that hundred twenty five crore people of our country have performed Yoga in the security forces and water bodies.
Some brave soldiers conducted yoga in the interconnection and some performed Yoga in the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force, in the midst of the sky, performed Yoga at a height of 10,000 feet from the earth and strengthened everyone.
They were swimming in the sky, not on the plane.
Yoga has been conducted in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and playing places.
Over the centuries, we have believed in the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, sages and other dignitaries, in any case, focused on Yoga literally.
More and more people will make this a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, this time several people have written to me in MyGov and Narendra Modi App to tell me about Dress Day in Mann Ki Baat this year.
That's right.
Just remember the doctor if we have a problem.
However, this is a day of our Doctors' achievements and this is a great opportunity to thank them for their service and dedication to the society.
The role of the doctor is not merely in the treatment of the disease.
Today, the doctor has a medical expertise, and he has a great experience about the general lifestyle and how it affects our lives.
With their skills and skills, Indian doctors have shown their personality all over the world.
Importance in the field of medicine is also known for solving problems related to diarrhea along with hard work.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to our doctors for all the people on the occasion of Doctors Day on 1st July.
Dear countrymen, we are lucky to be born in this land of India.
India has a rich history without a month or a day of any historical event.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true I'm coming to Maghar on 20th.
Do you know why he went to the cave
There was an idea that those who died in Megahar wouldn't have heaven.
Heaven will be available to those who die in Kashi straight away.
Magahar was treated as an insult, but Santh Kabir didn't believe it.
They are the same inspiring sources in today's times.
That is, a true saint knows and understands the pain of others.
He who doesn't know the pain of others is ruthless.
At that time, the world was witnessing turmoil and conflict, and he conveyed the message of peace and harmony.
Together with the world, they worked to remove opinions.
His words are true even after centuries.
Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
He has been guided by crores of people for centuries.
He taught Guru Nanak Dev to eradicate caste differences in the society and to transform humanity by seeing them together.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, It is God's service to the poor and the deprived.
Guru Nanak Dev's 50th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I urge you all to think about the new ideas, new suggestions and new concepts of Guru Nanak Dev's 50th birth anniversary of Prakash Parv society and how to celebrate all over the world.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The horrific event in Jallianwala Bagh, which has shaken the entire humankind, is going on for 100 years in 2019.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi has written in the Mobile App, which will be inaugurated by Dr.
Shyamaprasad is the birthplace of Mukherjee.
He has written to the people about Shyam Prasad Mukherjee in this programme.
Ramanji, thank you very much for the first time.
Dr.
In 1937, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore received the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee and addressed the Convocation in the University of Calcutta, Bengali.
At the time of the British rule, somebody at the University of Calcutta was speaking in Bengali language at the convocation.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development and built a strong base.
In India's first industrial policy announced in 1948, his ideas and philosophy have fallen.
His dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant in all sectors, skill and prosperity.
He wanted the SMEs to focus on handicrafts, clothing and cotton industries.
Between 1948 and 1950, the All India Handicrafts Board, the All India Handloom Board and the Khadi-Village Industries Board were established to provide financial assistance and organisational facilities for the proper development of the pool and small scale industries.
Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had the greatest thing as the integrity of India, for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of fifty-two.
Come on.
People talked about their imagination, their comfort and their achievements.
Girls in far-flung villages provide services from pension to passport to the elderly of the village through public service centres.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is doing ice cream industry with sewage.
In Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are doing medicinal facilities like Unnaked Prakash and bringing low-cost medicines to nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal was hungry for employment two-three years ago, and today a business of his own has been successful.
It's not only forty-five people.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues like waste disposal at the tunkering lab at their young age.
There are some people in the society who cannot find ways to disappoint them, not to convince them of failures, to create unbelief, not to find ways to break together.
And in such an environment, when the common man comes to ideas, new enthusiasm and events in his life, it is not the service of the government.
Even a small child in a small village can be inspired by a hundred and fifty crore people.
With the help of technology, when I spent time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it was very comfortable and inspiring to do something.
A new joy and a new zeal for the poorest of the poor gets a new inspiration.
I am very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people connected with this video bridge and gave me new strength.
We'll feel the fragrance of good.
I noticed something last day, that's a very different experience.
He worked successfully to increase the income of the farmers by formulating schemes related to the farmers.
In a way, the farmers have a big role in the entire chain from production to marketing, as well as efforts to ensure double profit by making the farmers partnership.
For that, Vito Bank has been created.
Women are looking for things in this Vittubank, and women are connected to it.
Something I know, some don't know, some know, some don't know, but millions of people constantly do some good things.
My dear countrymen, GST is going on for a year.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, and today it's really finished.
People from different political parties are sitting there, people from different states, people from different predecessors, but the decisions taken so far in the GST Council are unanimous.
There were several types of taxes in the country before the GST, as per this arrangement, only one type of tax is available across the country.
GST is the victory of honesty, this is the festival of honesty.
Earlier, the complaint was raised by Inspector Raj regarding taxes in the country.
IT and Information Technology (Information Technology) have been replaced by the inspector in GST.
From Return to Refund, everything goes online through information technology.
GST was perhaps the largest tax reform programme in the world.
This massive tax reform in India has been achieved by the people of the country and it has ensured the success of GST through the peoples power.
It was generally believed that such a massive reform would take 5-7 years to achieve the fullest success in such a large country.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Hello.
Navika Sagar Parikrama Yes, I would like to say something about them.
These six daughters of India, their team, have returned to India on May 21, after roaming around the world in the sea for more than twenty-five days.
The whole country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to see these daughters and listen to their travel experiences.
Once again, I once again congratulate the world for informing the adventures of those daughters, the values of the Navy, the values of India, especially the Indian women, that they are not bad at all.
Who doesn't have courage.
If we look at the development journey of mankind, we can see progress from the pregnancy of any adventure.
Development is at the brink of adventure.
On May 16, 5 tribal children from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Manisa Dhru, Pramesh Ale, Umamanta Madavi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam and others reached the highest peak in the world.
The children of Ashram started training on August 2017 and were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under Mashin Shaurya.
They were very proud of the country by defeating Everest in accordance with the name.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those associated with Chandrapur School.
At this time, the 16-year-old Shivangi Teacher became the youngest Indian girl to win Everest from Nepal.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the brave heroes, especially the women.
They're tagging each other and challenging them.
Everyone has joined this Fit India movement.
Film sector and sportspersons, common people of the country, soldiers of the army and teachers of the school have participated in this and have heard its turmoil from all around.
If we fit, India and Fit...
Captain Anirut Kohli of Indian Christian Team has challenged me and I have accepted his challenge.
The challenge like this will encourage us to fit others.
My dear countrymen, you have heard something about sportspersons and sportspersons many times in Mann Ki Baat.
Last time, the heroes of the Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme.
"Thank you very much for calling on the phone.
It is true that the games that were played in every street of the past and were part of every child's life are declining today.
These games were particularly part of summer.
Sometimes at lunch, sometimes at night, after dinner, children used to play for hours without any worry.
Outdoor, Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games.
The same game is known at various places in different names.
I am from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chomal-Isto.
It's playing with a cloth, or a mud, or a size of 8:8 square marble.
This game was mostly played in all the states.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara, in Madhya Pradesh, in Kerala, if Champal in Maharashtra, then in Tamil Nadu, there were many names like Changapo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you understand that people of every country don't know the language, yeah.
I'll tell you we're playing this game too.
Whoever doesn't play kids or shit in childhood
Children play games in villages and cities.
Various names were called in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it was enclosed as Godibilla or Karra Billa.
In Orissa, it is called Gulibari, which is called Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own weather, season.
It's like a season to fly.
When everybody plays a village, everybody plays a game, the different advantages of us can be expressed without any laziness.
Great people will be serious, but when they play, they're hiding.
Traditional sports, along with physical talent, encourage our efficiency, concentration, awareness and spirituality.
At the same time, we know our culture and tradition.
Many games make us aware of society and environment.
By calling people, we can create a great historical collection of our traditional games.
This time, the fire, the elimination of plastic waste is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you, to understand the importance of this theme, not to use polythene, low-cost plastic, but to reduce the impact on the nature of plastic waste, on wildlife and on our health.
Look at the very interesting suggestions given in the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018, and try to execute them in everyday life.
When it's very hot, when it's not raining, it'll start saying globell waming and climate changing like all the experts when it's cold.
But if you just say it's okay
This is basically a climate change, its consequences.
Our culture has not taught us to fight nature.
We have to be comfortable with nature, we have to live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi argued for this in all his life and every step.
Today, India speaks of climate justice, India has played a major role in the Cop21 Paris Agreement, and we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
How can we move on this
What can be done with a new one
It's raining.
News reports have been received that preparations are being made to celebrate International Day of Yoga on 21st June worldwide.
The Yoga Yoga for Unity for Unity has been recognising the world for the past few years.
By doing yoga, we always have the courage to wait like our father.
Yogi triumphs over all kinds of fears if all these qualities become friends.
I once again urge all the people to encourage our heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, comfortable and well-being nation.
My dear countrymen, today is 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehrus memorial.
Provisions for Panditji...
The memories of this month are linked to another person, heroes.
In May 1957, Indians showed their strength to the British.
In 1857, the warrior had written without fear that it was not a furore, but the first fight for independence.
Savarkar's life was full of specialties.
But beyond that, he was a great poet and a social reformer, who always gave importance to harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee has produced a very good column about Savarkarji.
Savarkar carried poetry and revolution together.
He was a sensitive poet and a brave revolutionary.
If there is an urge to do something, then it will be possible to achieve success among all the obligations.
It's not just about Seeker, but you can see it in every corner of Hindustan.
If you drive around, you'll see how people foil the bonds.
Still, when we go to a tea shore, we enjoy tea there, some of the closest conversations and conversations will be noticed.
These discussions can be related to politics, socialism, films, sportspersons, sportspersons, problems of the country.
You will be surprised to know that he is the light of education in the lives of more than seventy children.
He unveiled a school called 'Aasha-Aasasan' for children living in the streets and ghettos, for which a poor tear spends fifty percent of his income.
He provides education, health and food to all children coming to school.
I'm D.
Congratulations to Prakash Rao for his blessings and dedication and for giving a new direction to the lives of poor children.
He's made the darkness of their lives.
A lot of things like this will happen to you too.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Come on, let's encourage goodness.
He'll wait for the moon for a few days.
I believe that everybody will celebrate this occasion with utmost enthusiasm and specially the children will receive good gifts.
I hope that Eid will strengthen harmony and friendship in our society.
Many good wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
I'll gather again in Manki Baat next month.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
The Commonwealth Games held in Australia from 4th to 15th April 2018.
71 countries, including India, participated in it.
When such a big event takes place, imagine what will happen when thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participate.
Who can abstain from this in an environment of enthusiasm, enthusiasm, ideas, hopes and determination to gain.
India's recording performance in shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton.
India has achieved 66 medals, including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 silver.
This victory will make every Indian proud.
Everything is drowned in the same feeling.
The words will be defective to make that feeling clear.
But I want to hear you from the sportsman.
It was my dream to be a good player of India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restaurants that have been participating in India this time have received medals
Manika Batra won their medals in these events.
They are the first Indian women to win gold medal for India in the individual table tennis.
India has received maximum medal shooting.
Fifteen-year-old shooter Anish Bhanwala is the youngest player in the Commonwealth Games to win gold medal for India.
Sachin Choudhary is the only Para Power Lifter who won a medal in the Commonwealth Games for India.
This time, the medal winners are more women.
Whether it is a squash or a boxing or a weightlifting or a shooting, women have wondered.
The last fight in the Badminton is India's two players, Saina Nehwal and P.
Sindhu was together.
However, everybody had the courage to get two medals for India.
The gamemen in the games ran from many parts of the country to small towns.
They have a share of their strong friends in every corner.
Last month at Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the people, especially the youth, Fit India.
Cooperate with Fit India and urge Fit India to lead it.
I am very happy that people are very enthusiastic.
Shaskat Bhosley shares his own picture in the swimming pond, My Weapon Essay Body, My Elmond Ess Water, My World Ess Swimming...
Shearing her own picture of Dhaul Prajapati trekking, Fit India is a travel and trekking for me.
It was a matter of great pleasure that many prominent people are inspiring our youth for Fit India in a very attractive way.
Sanima Kalakaran Akshay Kumar has shared a video in the film.
You must see him exercising with Wooden beads.
He says this exercise is very good for outer and stomach muscles.
There's another video in the propaganda.
In that he's playing volleyball with people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences related to Fit India efforts.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for all of us and all over the country.
Another thing is to say, Yoga is the name of an unprofitable Fit India Movement.
Yoga has special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have started preparations.
The entire world has now accepted the importance of International Day of Yoga on June 21.
You'll be ready now.
Not alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your school, your films, everywhere, everybody, everybody, whether a man or a woman, should make efforts to connect with Yoga.
Today, in India or the world, there is no need to say, how Yoga is beneficial for the complete development of the body, mental development and mental balance.
You must have seen my animated video very prevalent.
They've shown the need to show a teacher very minutely through animation.
You'll get the benefit.
I would like to tell you something by inviting you for a new job.
Many youngsters have spent their time learning something new recently.
Otherwise, the Internship offers a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, avoiding paper, pen and computer, life gets an opportunity to live in a new way.
My young friends, I invite you to a special interview.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - Ministry of Sports, Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MoHRD) have jointly launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
If students from college, youngsters from NCC, NSS and Nehru Yuva Kendra Ventures want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to synergize the change of society, then they can be responsible for it.
This will enhance the support and strength of cleanliness, and it will be a pleasure to have something done before the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
The best participants, the best participants in the college, the best performers in the university, will be awarded at the national level.
Not only this, the UGC will give two credit points to those who finish very well.
Students, students and youngsters are once again inviting innovation to benefit from this.
You can go to MyGov and register the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope our youth will come forward in this movement for cleanliness.
I'm keen to know about your efforts.
You know what you know, tell about the events, send the photos, send the video.
Make use of this holiday for a new experience.
We want to appeal to the people to see that how many good things people do in every corner of our country, what good things are happening
I saw the story of the youngsters who are selflessly involved in the education of poor children in the past.
In addition to these youngsters, a big programme has been started for the education of the street children and children living in the hunters of the teeth.
Children who were begging on the road or working on a small job took them off, so they left for this activity.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this programme have moved from their busy life to two hours in this auspicious effort for social change.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers in the mountainous region of Uttarakhand are inspiring farmers across the country.
They have not only changed their own destiny, but have changed their own destiny.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly farming in Ragi, Chaulai, corn or barley.
The farmers didn't get the price they deserved because they were mountainous.
This biscuit of iron is very beneficial for pregnant women.
These farmers formed a cooperative movement in Munnar village and started a biscuit factory there.
Considering the courage of the farmers, the government also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
The biscuit is now reaching not only in the Bageshwar district but also at 50 anganwadi centres, Almora and Kaisani.
With the help of farmers, the annual income of the group has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs, but it has reduced the employment of more than 900 families from the district to outside.
We don't think that water supply is a social responsibility
Think of how we should protect every rain.
We know that water conservation is not a new issue in the minds of Indians.
Not the subject of the book, nor the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived this for centuries.
They gave priority to the glory of every drop of water.
They are looking for new ways to keep every drop of water safe.
Manar Kovil, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti and Nukotai, and many ponds still look like tourist centres.
But don't forget that these big things for water conservation are the living examples of our ancestors' efforts.
The UNESCO World Heritage Centres, known as Rani Ki Bavadi, at Adalaj and Patan in Gujarat, are the centres of excellence.
These ponds are water temples in a way.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbawadi in Jodhpur.
This is one of the largest and most beautiful bawadis in India, the most important thing is that it is a water deficient region.
The time of April, May, June and July is the best time for water conservation.
In the last three years, everybody has done something in their own way in water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, a total of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on 55 of the total expenditure, i. e.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by this kind of water conservation and water management.
Sasur, who had been dried up with the help of people from around 40-45 villages, revived the Khaderi rivers.
Whether it is animals or birds, whether it is a farmer or a farm or a village, how blessed it is for all
En Kumar Banerji MyGov of Devithala village of North 24 Fargan district of West Bengal has written: We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, but many people do not know about the vision of living peacefully, beautifully and holistically.
Please discuss this issue in the Manki Baat programme to inform people about this.
His penance has been composed of a massive mark on everybody and Rabindranath was a talented personality.
I had the habit of listening to it... but I don't know the language... but wake up early in the morning and listen to the radio.
Maybe his poems have influenced you too.
I salute Rabindranath Tagore on this occasion.
The month of Ramsan is celebrated with due respect and respect throughout the world.
The social aspect of fasting is that when man is hungry himself, he knows the hunger of others.
You know the thirst of others when you thirsty yourself.
Once a man asked the prophet what was best in Islam.
The prophet replied, Give meals to a poor or hungry person and behave with compassion, whether you know them or not.
People offer gifts to those who deserve this holy month.
According to Prophet Mohammad, a person is rich because of a sacred spirit, not money and wealth.
Let us glorify that India is the land of Lord Buddha, which showcases the strength of mercy, service and sacrifice. He has guided millions of people across the world.
Recalling this full-fledged Lord Buddha, he reminds us of our responsibility to strive and resolve on the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the most human value worldwide.
Buddha's inspiration is very high in Baba Saheb Ambedkar's social philosophy.
Baba Saheb laid the foundation stone: My social vision was established in three words - freedom, equality, brotherhood.
The roots of my philosophy are in religion, not in political science.
I have accepted them from my Guru Buddha.
Brothers and sisters, the poor, the exploited, the deprived and relieved millions of people have been empowered by the Baba Saheb Constitution.
There is no greater example of compassion.
This compassion of people was one of the greatest benefits of Lord Buddha.
The advice of Lord Buddha is traditionally available anywhere in Asia.
I am very happy that the Government of India is participating in the revival of several Buddhist temples, including the centuries-old divine joyous temple of Myanmar.
Today, there is a vision of conflict and humanitarian pain all over the world, and the advice of Lord Buddha guides to despise hatred.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of the world who believe in the principles of respect and compassion for Lord Buddha.
I pray for the blessings of Lord Buddha to fulfil my responsibility for building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his advice for the entire world.
There was a new confidence in the people of India spread all over the world.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, at the western end of India, a mortal test was conducted in Pokharan, Rajasthan.
It has been 20 years since Lord Buddha's blessing on the day of Buddha Purnima.
Indias experiment was successful and India was able to showcase science and technology.
The day is marked as an exhibition of military power in India.
Lord Buddha showed the world that the strength of the inner world is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you are strong as a nation, you all will be able to live peacefully.
It is important not only for the country but for the month of May 1998, but also for how it was done and how it was done.
India's land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India and the world will scale new goals and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave a mantra, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan...
We can enjoy a new joy and a new joy in taking it forward.
My dear countrymen, once again we meet in Mann Ki Baat, we can say more.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is Ram Navami's holy day.

I also urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat, who worked on culture to take forward the advice of Commonwealth.
You urge everyone to water the birds in the summer.

In the summer, the birds told us about the water.
There are letters from farmers brothers and sisters regarding matters going on from Kisan Melas and farming across the country.
Some people who are conscious of water conservation have suggested.
In the Festival, there will be letters about our festivals, our culture and our traditions.
Why don't you change in these things, in these experiences, in these examples, there is so much inspiration, energy, spirituality and enthusiasm for doing something for the country.
It involves the strength to change the entire climate of the country.
When I can see through the letter that Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karinganj in Assam, created 9 schools for poor children by his will, then I can see the country's unforgettable will.
When Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary from Kanpur heard the story of checking the poor and giving them free medicines, there was a chance to understand the people of this country.
Car driver Sadul Luskar's sister died due to lack of timely treatment 13 years ago.
After 12 years of collection of such money, the last illustrious attempt by Siddul Laskar was visible.
Due to his determination and hard work, a 30-hour hospital has been set up near Kolkata in a revived village.
Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, the world has changed its vision for India.
We are moving forward among all sections of the society, our country is moving forward.
This self-confidence, this Positivity will help in realising our resolve for New India, it will be a dream.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is why a lot of letters have come up with agriculture.
This time, I saw a video of the discussions with the farmers on DD Kissan channel of Doordarshan, all the farmers should contact DD Kissan channels of Doordarshan.
The feeling that Mahatma Gandhi was interested in soil, farming, farming, farming and farming is evident in his quote, he said, To forget how to diagnose the truth and to tell the soil, is forgot courses.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri had strongly argued about the conservation of trees, plants and trees, and the need to embrace good farming.
Ramanohar Lohya said that our farmers need to wake up in large quantities to ensure affordable income, affordable irrigation facilities and to increase production of food items and milk.
In a speech in 1979, Choudhary Charan Singh urged farmers to use new technologies and make new findings and stressed their need.
I went to the Agricultural Excellence Festival held in Delhi last day.
My discussions with the farmers brothers and scientists there, my experiences related to agriculture, understanding and knowing new findings related to agriculture, etc. were very pleasant to me.
But I was so impressed by the Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This state, which has a very small dimension, has shown great work.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have produced records in 2015-16 as compared to the previous five years.
If I consider the MSP as the MSP, the labour cost of other workers in a small amount of money, the cost of their four labourers, machinery or the cost of machinery, the cost of all types of furnaces used, the cost of irrigation, the cost of water consumption, the expenditure on the state's grassroots, the cost of the work done on the capital, the rent on the soil...
Besides, a lot of work is being done for the agricultural market reforms in the country to get the right price for the farmers.
Efforts are being made to connect rural markets with Holseil Market and global markets.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the centenary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is our determination.
Besides, how can 100-20 million people pay the best attention to Gandhiji by joining the shoulders
You should share your opinion with MyGov on my request to you all.
What should be the logo of Gandhi 150
Slogan, spell, or what should be a celebration
Today, in the health sector, the country has moved from traditional methods.
Everything related to health in the country was the responsibility of the Health Ministry alone.
Today, all the Departments and Ministries are working together for a healthy India - a healthy India - a healthy and cost-effective health care with the Ministry of AYUSH or the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
Resistance is the cheapest and easiest healthcare.
The more we are aware of immunity, the benefits of the individual, the family and the society.
If life is healthy, then it's clean first.
As a nation, we have taken the challenge together, as a result, in four years, the sanitation coverage has doubled, almost 80 percent.
Besides, extensive work is underway to create healthcare centres across the country.
Yoga has become a peoples movement today, it is because of the dedication of all of us.
This time, the International Day of Yoga is only 100 days left to reach June 21.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the world have been enthusiasticly involved.
We must ensure that this time we will do Yoga ourselves and motivate the entire family, friends and everyone to do Yoga.
You must inspire children, youth and elderly citizens in new attractive ways of doing Yoga.
Various programmes related to Yoga are being organized throughout the year on TV and electronic media.
Can we create an enlightenment on Yoga as a campaign from now on till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I'll share the video with you... so that we can learn asanas and pranayama together.
They'll be very helpful.
For heart patients, the cost of heart stents is less than 85 percent.

My dear countrymen, on April 14, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth is a victory.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For him, the industry was a good medium for providing employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when we successfully launch the Make in India campaign in the country, Dr.
With this philosophy, the Smart Cities Mission and Urban Cities Mission have been launched in the country today. It should be possible to provide all kinds of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country, be it good roads or water supply, healthcare or education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance.
He wanted no person to remain in poverty forever.
At the same time, he believed that poverty cannot be averted only by giving some wages to the poor.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are giving birth to our youngsters.
He emphasized the importance of water consumption for the development of the country, various river valley authorities, various water related commissions, all are born in Baba Saheb Ambedkars vision.
Today, efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
He highlighted the importance of Federalism and Federalism between the Centre and the States for the growth of the country.
He showed that it is not essential for us to be born in a big or rich family to reach higher levels, but for those who are born in a poor family in India, to dream and to make efforts to realize those dreams.
Baba Saheb has fooled Ambedkar.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice in India.
I urge all of you to participate in this programme with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals in the days to come, the Jayanti of Lord Mahavir, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaishakhi.
It is a day when Lord Mahavir's Jayanti remembers his sacrifice and penance.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of Ahimsa, will inspire us all.
Greetings to all people on Mahavir Jayanti.
Speaking about the Easter, Jesus Christian motivational advisory would be remembered, and he gave a message of peace, harmony and righteousness and compassion to mankind.
Vaishakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and write a few things.
We see the colour of the ocean blue, but we understand from our experience that the water will not be colored.
Have we ever thought why the water in the river or the ocean is colorful
The same question arose in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the question that a scientist was born in modern India.
Now, when we talk about science, first of all, India's C.
One of his findings is known as Raman Effect.
Because this is the day he found the truth of light skating, and this is why he received a noble gift.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendranath Bose are all proud of India.
The famous Boson Party has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Next morning, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai, inaugurated by the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was a pleasure to know about the wonders in the field of science.
The Artificial Intelligence has helped in manufacturing robots, boots and other fixed machines.
Now machines make their brains more smart through self learning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence can help in facilitating the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can we know about natural calamities in a better way through the Artificial Intelligence
Can farmers help in farming
Can artificial intelligence help in making healthcare delivery more easier and treatment of diseases in a modern way
Last day, the Prime Minister of Israel, along with the Prime Minister, had the opportunity to participate in the inauguration of the I-Create programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man talking about the development of a digital device.
I feel that many such things can be used for artificial intelligence.
Scientific science is one of valu nutrients.
Any machine we want will work.
But what we want to do with the machine is dependent on us.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the bright bubble, failed several times in his experiment.
Once asked about this, he replied, "I looked for 10,000 ways to find the bubble.
I mean, Edison has made his own failures.
Unfortunately, let me say good luck, today I am in Aravali, the land of Maharshi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, raised questions to the British India.
The idea of questioning the truth again is great.
This is the real inspiration behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't be quiet until you get answers to what.
On this occasion of National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to scientists and all others related to science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages on all issues related to security and disasters during the times of conflicts and people write something related to it.
From Pune, Shri Ravindra Singh and the Narendra Modi Mobile App are on the safety of the workers.
He has written that safety norms are not good in our country where factory and manufacturing are underway.
The Prime Minister said that on 4th March, Indias National Safety Day, the Prime Minister said that people should also talk about safety in the Mann Ki Baat programme to be aware of safety.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important, initiatives and initiatives.
One more dangerous time - safety during distortion - the other necessary in daily life - safety in averted life .
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, if there is no such consciousness, then it is difficult to have it when there is danger.
We have often written on the boards that are seen on the way - if there is no awareness then the danger will certainly be a mistake, and happiness and laughter will be lost.
I would like to say that fire brigades in cities with fire brigade should go to schools once a week or once a month to showcase in front of children.
Fear brigade will also have the habit of being careful and the new generation will be able to know a lot about it.
In terms of dangers, India is a country of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has witnessed many disasters like natural calamities, chemical accidents and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) stands at the forefront of facing dangers in the country.
NDMA is coming up at a rapid pace for rescue operations in various accidents like earthquake, floods, storms and landslides.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives year after year due to heat wave.
The number of deaths due to heat in 2017 has decreased to about 220.
We can understand from this that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people working in the society, there are socio-economic organisations, there are cautious citizens, I congratulate all those who have come to the rescue system within a minute.
There's no dearth of heroes like this.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces, etc. have reached the peak and bravely helped people not to save their lives.
We have to create a society that is aware of the danger.
We keep values in our culture, often talk about protective values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
In our ordinary lives, we are travelling on a plane for hundreds of times, and in the air hostess, we see the initial warnings of safety.
We must have heard it hundred times, but if someone takes us on a plane and tells us where everything is, where is life jacket
Therefore, our ears on the plane have a sounding nature, but we don't think these warnings are even for me.
This is what happens in every sphere of life.
We shouldn't think that security is for anyone else.
If we are aware of our security, the feeling of security of the society must have been included in it.
Dear Countrymen, this time, with the aim of Swachh Bharat in the budget, the villages had given importance to the issue of West to Energy in Bioyas.
The objective of this Gobar Dhan Yojana is to make the villages clean, hydroelectric, fertilizer residue, composta and bio-asa, thereby creating wealth and energy.
The number of people in India is the highest in the world, where about 300 million 4 million people and their sugarcane production is around 3 million tonnes per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen scheme, we are also moving forward in this regard.
Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
I invite you to participate in this mass movement called Clean Energy and Green Job and come forward to enrich the waste of your own village and transform the dust into dustbin.
My dear countrymen, we have so far heard about a number of festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival and Film Festival.
However, in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first round of festivals were held in the state as a unique festival.
The aim of this festival organized by Raipur was to create awareness about cleanliness and awareness about the strange ways to utilize the waste of the city in a constructive manner and bring the waste to recycle.
Several programmes were organized during this festival, in which the elderly people participated.
Various festivals have been organized in other districts by motivation from Raipur.
Everyone in their own way shared fresh ideas on cleanliness and talked about poetry.
I congratulate the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of that place.
Every year on March 8, International Women's Day is celebrated.
A lot of programmes are organized in our country and around the world.
On this day, I salute all those who have done exemplary work in various fields by awarding Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development more than women's development.
I remember Swami Vivekananda's words on this occasion.
He said that the idea of complete womenhood is a complete freedom, and this idea, which Swamiji had put forward 20-five years ago, shows the understanding of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equality of women in all spheres of social and economic life that we are responsible for ourselves.
We are a part of the tradition of recognising men by women, namely Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Puthan.
Today, our women power expresses self-confidence and self-confidence through their actions.
They took the country and the society forward and brought it to a new goal.
Our New India is a vision that is ultimately women-powered and equally partner in the holistic development of the country.
There can be many examples of what women power can do and these stories that inspire life can be seen around.
I want to know something from Jharkhand.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand and 15 lakh women have undertaken Swachhta Abhiyan for one month.
These women in Jharkhand have shown that the cleanliness campaign in normal life can be transformed into the nature of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, two days ago, in the three villages of Elephanta Islands, there were reports of electrification after 70 years of independence.
You know that the Elephanta Island is in the sea ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
This is a very attractive tourist destination.
I congratulate the government and the people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves in Elephanta will now have the light of electricity.
This is not just electrification but also a new beginning of development.
May the light spread in the lives of the people, be happy in life... and be more happy and encouraging than this.
My dear countrymen, we celebrated Shivratri on the last day.
Now it is time to harvest abundant farmland and refreshing wheat and other golden harvests and potatoes that blossom the mind this month.
And this month is a month of fondness for everyone.
On March 2, everyone will celebrate Holi with fervor.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participated in this festival.
He was addressing the gathering on 1st February, in memory of Kalpana Chowla, who travelled in space.
Even though we were separated from the danger of the Colombia space ship, millions of youngsters from all over the world were inspired.
It is a matter of sadness for all of us to lose Kalpana Chowla at such a young age.
It is a matter of great pleasure that in India, these women are moving fast in all walks of life and are making the country proud.
In ancient times, the honour of the women of our country, their position in the society, their contributions are surprised all over the world.
There is a long tradition of Indian scholars.
Let us talk about Bachao Bai Padhao.
In ancient times, Rachchikepe says in Skandapura: Dasyaputra, Sammanya, Dasyaputra worker, that is the result of availability Maratha, he is a virtue of virtue.
That is, a daughter is equal to ten sons, and you will receive the reward from ten sons.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why in our society women have been given the status of strength.
This woman power lays down the entire country, the entire society, the entire family in the graves of unity.
Whether it is the legendary scholars of Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitrei, the scholars of Akamahdevi and Meerabai, the ruler of Ahalyabai Holkar, the courage of Rani Lakshmibai, the strength of women is inspired by us.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the people on the auspicious occasion.
Prakash Trichy continues to give several examples.
Our brave Defence Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has written that the flight flight to Hugoi 30 is inspiring.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, the women members of the Indian Navy have written about the world surrounding INSV Tarini.
He highlighted the courageous women, Bhavnakanth, Mohna Singh, who were the pilots of Chaturvedi Ever Warship and trained in Sukhoi 30.
Women headed by Kaksha Vajpayee are proud to fly to San Francisco, USA in Delhi and Dilliol and Air India's Boeing Jet.
All women should remember...
These women who have acquired NE - the first female marchant navi captain, the first female train driver, the first female fire fighter, the first female bus driver, the first lady in Antarctica, the first lady in Everest, the first lady in Everest, the first woman in all these fields, the first woman in Everest, and the first woman in all these fields, the first woman in the world, who had achieved NEEE for the first time in all spheres by breaking the sustainability of our women-powered society.
They asked them to take a new path to all obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, hard work, determination and determination.
Not only their contemporary people, but also for generations to come.
They will fill a new zeal and inspiration.
A book has also been prepared about these women who have acquired Neem - so that no one in the country should know about this woman power, you should inspire yourself in the work done by them in their life.
This is available for e-building on Narendra Modi Web Site.
Women power has an important role to play in the active changes in the country and the society.
When we talk about women empowerment, we want to talk about a railway station.
You must have thought about the relationship between Railway Station and Women Empowerment.
Mumbai's Manuga Station is the first station in India with all workers and women.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is an area of Maoism-infected area.
Maoists have created an atmosphere full of violence, invasions, bombs, guns and pistols.
In such a horrific area, tribal women are getting self-sufficiency by driving e-ORICS.
In a short span of time, a lot of women are associated with this.
With this, it will also give strength to environmental protection.
The district administration has played a crucial role in the success of these women.
For centuries against social misconceptions and evils, in our society, individual and socially striving continuously.
A few days ago, in Bihar, there was such a beginning.
Thousands of kilometres long humanitarian efforts have been made to root out social misconduct in the state.
Through this drive, the social conscience was raised against the misconceptions of child marriage and women's system.
The state resolved to fight evils such as women and child marriage.
The youngsters, mothers and sisters, who were enthusiastic and enthusiastic, all of them participated in this fight.
The boundaries of the state of mankind, which began in the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, have remained unprecedented.
It is essential for everybody in the society to be free from the misconceptions of the society to gain the right direction of development.
Come, let us swear to liberate the society on the evils, let us build a New India, a strong and capable India.
He was unaware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
Now you know about the Jan Aushadhi Yojana, when you started buying pearls, the cost of the desert decreased by 75 percent.
Over the past few days, a lot of people used to write about it and used to say it.
The objective of this scheme is to make the healthcare available to everyone and increase the ease of living.
Dead at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are 50-90 lower than branded deer.
That's why the beneficial deer are available at a lower price.
It has set up more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras across the country.
There is also a new employment opportunities for those who want to find individual labour.
The priceless deer are available at the Prime Minister's Janaushadhi Kendras and at the hospital's Amrit Stores.
All this has only one objective - what is the goal of providing affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy India can be created.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a fo in the Narendra Modi App.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola have organised a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morna as per Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river Morna flows for twelve months and Eli flows only during the rainy season.
The river is completely full of flowers and flowers and it is a painful scene.
A lot of waste is thrown out on the river and its banks.
On the first step of Mission Clean Morna on January 13, a day before the Makar Sankranti, the two sides of the river Morna were cleaned at 104 locations in four kilometers of the area.
More than four thousand people from Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college students, cooks, adults, mothers, sisters and others participated in this scheme of Mission Clean Morna.
On 20th January, 2018, the Swachh Bharat Mission will continue every Saturday morning till the river Morna becomes completely clean.
It's not impossible for anyone to do something.
A massive change can be brought about by the people.
Congratulations to the people of Akola, the district administration and the rulers of the state, all those who participated in this transformation into a mass movement and this effort will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about Padma Puraskar these days.
There are reports on this in newspapers and TV.
It is a matter of routine importance to give Padma awards every year, since its methodology has been prevalent in the last three years.
Any citizen can nominate anyone.
It is transparent due to all the processes being carried out by Olympics.
In a way, the selection process for these awards has changed completely.
People in cities, newspapers, television and conferences have been given Padma awards.
The award for Arvind Gupta was given by Kay.
You will also be happy to know that IIT Kanpur has dedicated your life to make toys for these Aravindan kids.
He has been making toys with things that have been abandoned to grow scientific faces in Kundi for four decades.
He tried to inspire scientific experiments to avoid the use of cooks.
For this, inspire films made in 18 languages in 1000 schools across the country.
Surprisingly, life, wonder and dedicate.
One such story is the story of Sitawa Jodhn in Karnataka.
The goddess of women's empowerment isn't just saying.
They have contributed greatly to the transformation of the lives of innumerable women in Balgaon for the past three decades.
When they were seventy years old, they dedicated their lives to Goddess Pid for the good of Goddesses.
Not only this, the pulse worked for women's good and foremost.
The whole world is respected because of this interest.
He will be showcasing his paintings in countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He was given Padma Shri by recognising the talent of Majju Shyam, who knew India abroad.
You will be surprised to know that the story of Kerala's tribal lady Laxmiku is very charming.
Laxmiku lives in a place of stone and lives in the tribal areas of Kottayam.
Five hundred green deers are built by their memories.
There is a special ability to build a desert for Sarpavisha.
Lakshmiji continues to serve the society through her own knowledge of the greenery.
The nation is honoured by Padma Shri to recognize this personality and contribute to the society.
At the age of 23, her husband died without treatment and this was inspired to build a hospital for the poor.
Thousands of poor people will be treated free of cost through their hard work.
Perhaps they should be invited to school and colleges and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, there must be some effort of the society.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas on January 9 every year.
On 9th January, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate an unprecedented relationship with the Indians living in India and the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we have organized a programme to invite neighbouring Parliamentarians and mayors from all over the world.
In many countries like Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Brian, Suriname, South Africa and America, you and Indian dignitaries and MPs participated in the event.
I am glad that people of different countries live in India, along with those countries who have rooted in India, they have not maintained their close relations with India, and this time the European Union has sent me a calendar.
Our Indian diaspora live in different countries of Europe - some work with cyber security, some dedicated to Ayurveda, some of them enjoy the spirit of the society through their music.
30 January is the day of remembrance of a new path for all of us.
We pay homage to the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the security of the nation at 11 o'clock.
They're not just theories.
My dear countrymen, I conclude by congratulating you all on the good wishes of 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat this year and today is the last day of 2017.
I shared a lot of things with you this year.
The year will change after a few hours, but the share of our ideas will continue again.
On the occasion of Christmas, we remember the great lessons given by Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ gave great importance to the spirit of service.
We see the essence of service in the Bible too.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhamsar used to say, "Life should be done with devotion".
Extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
In this endeavor, he had to personally lose a lot.
In the beginning of this year, it was a very lucky opportunity for me that Guru Gobind Singh was able to participate in the inauguration ceremony held at Patna Sahib on the occasion of 3rd Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
We can decide with our mind that Guru Gobind Singh will learn lessons from the great lessons taught by him and the inspirational life.
January 1, 2018, that is tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say it's special, I say it's really special.
Indian democracy welcomes voters from 20th century and voters from New India.
This India is encouraging you to welcome the voters of the 20th century.
You must be proud of being a voter in the 20th century.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The strength of the vote is the greatest power in democracy.
Voting is one of the most effective in bringing about a progressive change in the lives of millions of people.
You don't just have the right to vote.
You can be the creators of the twenty-first century by thinking of what your dream of India should be about the 20th century.
The youth of New India is a source of zeal, enthusiasm and energy.
The dream of New India is fulfilled through our vibrant, skilled and powerful youth.
When we talk of New India, it speaks of a free India from casteism, casteism, terrorism and corruption.
India free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone gets equal opportunity, the New India fulfills the aspirations of everyone.
Shanti, unity and harmony are the strengths that guide us.
My youngsters must come forward and analyze how new India will be created.
How can we realize our concepts before 2022
How can we build an India like our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, we have to organize a mass movement to create a magnificent and divine India of the 21st century.
The mass movement of development, the mass movement of progress, and the peoples movement for a strong India.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been opened for the youth.
Our youth have come forward and succeeded in innovation and industrial entrepreneurship since innovation.
I would like to imagine how the youth of this New India can get information about such opportunities when they are 18 years old and they are able to easily learn about these schemes, and thereby create an ecosystem that can benefit.
There is nothing impossible for a person full of positive thought and enthusiasm.
There's a question in English, Pessimism Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
The letters and responses were really encouraging.
It was very comfortable.
Some people shared the positive impact of their minds.
Some shared their personal gains.
My name is Fishu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jupiter Rajendra Wade.
I'm talking from Boddle.
According to my husband's orders, the insurance coverage amounted to one rupee per month.
He died in an accident.
So we know what our situation is.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
Our villages are going on National Highways from 2017.
My name is Satish Bawani.
There was a shortage of water in our area and we have been dependent on the military's pipeline for the past 40 years.
Now putting a special pipeline...
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many things like this in their own way of changing the positive changes in the lives of people.
In fact, this is the new India that we are building together.
Next time, I was informed about the story of the inspiring story of Bashir Khan Khatak, the former Passenger of the Administrative Service from Kashmir.
He was free from the poison of terrorism and hate. He was at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
You will be surprised to know that the terrorists had burnt his legacy in 1990.
His family had to leave their legacy and run away as much as terrorism and violence.
He chose a different path for himself, and the way to serve the people.
Escaping from the opposite environments, the story of victory itself drew itself.
Today, he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired the youth of the country.
Amaze has proven that how bad the environment is, however, the positive step is to avoid carmegs of disappointment.
Last week I had a chance to see some girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
There was enthusiasm, enthusiasm, energy, dream and determination.
I was inspired as long as I spent with those children.
This is the strength of the country, these are my young men, and I thought they were the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, not only of my country but also of the world's famous religious places.
Crores of devotees visit this world famous temple every year to receive the blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami.
How big a challenge can it be for the devotees to wait in such a glorious place without dirt
If there is a mountain and a jungle area, can you specifically say
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme called Punam Poongavan, which has started a campaign of awareness about waste management.
Any devotee, whoever comes, has made a habit that the journey will not be completed without doing any physical work in terms of cleanliness.
There's no big deal in this movement, no small one.
Assuming that every devotee is a part of the worship of Lord, for some time he has been working for cleanliness, works and works for waste.
The pilgrimage here is very surprising in every morning, and all the pilgrims participate in it.
No matter how big a celebrity or a rich person, everybody becomes a part of a programme like a common devotee and will move forward after purification.
There are many such examples before us.
It is a part of the pilgrimage of every devotee to commemorate such a plethora of cleanliness in Sabarimala.
There must be cleanliness along with a terrible velocity.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we had taken a pledge for Bapus birthright that Swachh Bharat and Swachh Bharat would fulfil the incomplete mission of Bapuji.
Bapu ji spent his entire life working for this thing.
In the rural and urban areas, there has been a widespread change in the cooperation of the people.
The world's largest Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be held on 4th January, 2018 to assess the achievements made in urban areas in terms of sanitation standards.
This survey will be conducted in more than four and a half cities amongst nearly four crore people.
I'll talk to the citizens and find their response.
Use of Swachhata App will also be analyzed about the innovation of various types of service centres.
To change the cleanliness of the city into the nature of the people, it will be checked whether all arrangements have been made in the city to change the nature of the city.
Don't let the government do the cleaning.
There is a great responsibility for all citizens and civil society.
I urge all the people to participate in the Swachhta Survekshan in the coming days.
Try that your city should not be backward and that your village should not be backward.
On the basis of this survey, the ranking of cities will be done - if your city is more than one lakh people, if there is a small population in the rankings of the country then it is your dream to get the highest position in the local rankings.
Come, once again, with this determination, we can use the best efforts to remind Bapu of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, some things seem to be very small but as a society, they have a far-reaching impact on our personality.
Today, I would like to share such a thing with you in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
For decades Muslim women were being injustice, but no one discussed it.
There are no such laws in many Islamic countries.
But the Muslim women of India had no right to go to Haj without menstruation.
I have instructed the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all women applying for leave alone are allowed to go to Haj.
I would like to give them a special opportunity to join this group to avoid this brutality of women who are applying to go alone.
India's development journey has been carried forward on the basis of their talent by the strength of our women.
I firmly believe that our women and men must have equal rights and equal opportunities. We must continue to work together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic festival for us.
However, it will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
This year, on the occasion of Republic Day celebrations, leaders from ten ASEAN countries will come to India as chief guests.
On Republic Day, there will be 10 chief guests this time.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and completed 25 years of Indias alliance with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us to join together these great leaders from 10 countries of the world in January 26.
My dear countrymen, this is a festival season, in a way our country is a country of festivals.
There's never been a day that's not connected to the festival.
We've just celebrated Christmas, the New Year's coming.
May the New Year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us move forward with new enthusiasm, new zeal and happiness and new resolve.
The month of January is the day when the sun moves to the north, the month of Makar Sankranti is celebrated.
This is a celebration of nature.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu are special in its own way and they have their own importance.
These festivals are celebrated between January 13 and January 17.
All these festivals are different but basic principles are the same.
My best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my dear people.
Man Ki Batt, September 2019
They're older than us, and they're witnesses of every step and period of the country.
I had the privilege of speaking on the phone with Didi before I left for a foreign trip.
It was a very affectionate conversation as he spoke to his brother and sister.
I don't usually talk about personal conversations like this.
Modiji-Ladadi, Pranam.
I'm speaking Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to Modi Ji on his birth anniversary.
May the health of Didi be well, we pray that Didi's blessings be with us.
Before I went to America, I was calling for Didi's proposal.
It was a pleasure to hear that Lataji-Modi ji's phone will come.
You'll be back forever
Everyone at home...
Lataji - I think that the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners.
You don't know what you are.
I know that as soon as you come, the picture of India is changing.
Modiji- yes.
Mother was very happy with this affection of Modiji-Didi.
I am extremely grateful that Modiji-Didi always remembers me.
Once again, I convey my best wishes.
Modiji was sure to visit Mumbai this time.
Modiji, but I'll be back soon.
Modiji - You should come home and eat something Gujarati from Didi's hand.
Lataji, of course.
I'll think it lucky.
Modiji - Pranam Didi.
Lata ji Pranam.
My best wishes to Modi Ji and Didi, Lataji Namaste.
Modiji Namaste.
My dear countrymen, the period of celebrations from today onwards has once again reached new zeal, new energy, new zeal and new determinations.
For weeks, the country will be filled with the brightness of festivals.
On festivals, everyone in the family will join together.
This is what you call the darkness in the lantern.
Perhaps this is not just words, but an order for all of us, a vision, a motivation.
On the one hand, when a lot of houses are lightened, think on the other hand, they're covered with darkness in the neighbourhood.
When this darkness fades away, the real pleasure of these festivals is felt when it spreads light.
They search for the needy in their homes, dresses, sweets and food and deliver them.
This time, in this season of festivals, can you try to darken the darkness of the lamp with due awakening and determination
Your face will be more shining, your light will be more shining and your light will be more shining.
Can we welcome Lakshmi this time in a new way
In our culture, women are considered Lakshmi, because women bring good luck and prosperity.
There will be in our midst many daughters who have shining the name of the family and the society and the country by their own dedication and dedication.
Can we organize a programme to honour these Laxmis of India on this occasion of Diwali
There will be many sons and daughters who do extraordinary things around us.
Our society must recognize such women, honour them and be proud of them.
Let us all propagate this as the world has propagated a great mass movement called Selfie with Daughter.
Similarly, this time we can organize a public meeting called Bharat Key Laxmi.
Encouraging Laxmi of India is to strengthen the path of prosperity of the country and the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, I have already said that through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have the privilege of direct and indirectly interacting with many people who do not know me.
Last day, a student from Arunachal, Alina Thayog, sent me a very interesting letter from Arunachal.
My country is Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my exams came, people asked me if I had read a book called Exam Warriors.
After that, my experience was very good.
I thought it would be very good if I had read that book before the exam.
And this little girlfriend has given me a job.
But I have a request that you can help me.
I'm sure it's all.
I'll surely try to write my words in my own way, as I think about it and think I'm right.
I once again thanked the student Alina Thyang, this little friend of Arunachal.
Look.
This time, as was discussed on the success of the US operation, the speeches of the Returner of Daniel Medvedev were discussed and good publicity was also received.
I've been playing and watching the speech.
The glory of Dan Madwedev, 23, attracted everyone.
Of course it attracted me too.
Shortly before this speech, he had failed to write to Rafael Nadal, a legendary of Tennis and Grand Slam Jeth 19 times.
If there were others on this occasion, the depressed would have been disappointed.
His words were welcomed by the visioners there.
He said that how Nadal inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis, how difficult it was to play with him.
The zeal and victory of the man who failed in the same game.
If you don't hear the words of Dan Medvede, I want to tell you all, especially the youngsters, that video must be seen.
People of all ages, who belong to all sections of the society, have a lot to learn, and these are the great moments behind the kingdoms.
The kingdoms don't matter.
It's a lifetime.
This has been described in our country's sciences in a very beautiful way.
The thinking of our ancestors is certainly appreciable.
It has been stated in the auspicious time that the world's universal universal universal universal universal interaction between a person and a person cannot win.
In fact, this young sportsperson has conquered the minds of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, especially young friends, I am going to tell you this thing directly for your good.
Discussions will take place, but there will be great benefits before some things grow up.
When it's too big, it's very difficult to stop things when it's too wide.
But in the beginning, if we stop it very carefully, we can defend many things.
The habit of smoking is because of nicotine.
Eating this in childhood affects the growth of the brain.
But today I want to tell you about a new subject.
You must be aware that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
E-cigarettes are different from normal cigarettes.
A kind of chemical smoke is produced when nicotine substance gets heated in e-cigarettes.
Like other cigarettes , to avoid absorption from it mix aromatic chemicals in it .
He has seen that even if his father is a chain smoker at home, he is trying to stop others from smoking at home and wants children not to have a habit of smoking cigarettes and beedi.
He wants not to smoke cigarettes and cigarettes at home.
He knows that smoking and tobacco have a great harm to the body.
But the e-cigarette is completely different.
People don't know so much about e-cigarettes.
And sometimes the e-cigarette gets into the house as if it was just filthy.
If someone smokes us, you know we can know it with smell.
The cigarette's pack in his pocket, but the smell can make it known.
So many children and youngsters are proud to be fashioned in their books, offices, pockets, sometimes roaming around in their pockets.
Youth is the future of the country.
This new method of intoxication has been prohibited in the country by e-cigarettes to avoid destroying our youth, not to cheat the dreams of our families, not to ruin the lives of children.
I appeal to everyone to leave the habit of tobacco and not to misunderstood the e-cigarette.
You remember Fit India, right
Fit India is not meant to go to Jim for two hours in the morning and late.
For Fit India, you have to stay away from it.
Our country is a great saint.
There are many human beings on this earth.
India was the land of extraordinary people like that.
They are dedicated themselves for others, not for themselves.
Such a greatness is being honoured in the city on October 13th.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians, and Pope Francis will proclaim Mary Thresia as Holy on October 13.
Sister Mary Tresia is an example all over the world for the good of mankind in a short life span of 50 years.
My dear countrymen, India is not only proud of the fact that while we are celebrating Gandhi 150, 130 crore people have resolved to get rid of single-use plastic.
India is moving ahead with the world in terms of environment conservation, so the entire world's attention is now on India.
I am sure that you will also be part of the peoples movement to avoid coincidence plastic on October 2.
Everywhere people play their role in this third in their own way.
But a young man of our country has done a very different move.
When I turned my attention to his work, I called him and tried to know and understand his new way.
He said it might be useful for the country and the people.
Mr.
When I first heard the word 'plogging', it was a new word.
Perhaps this word can be used a little overseas.
But India has given a big propaganda to it.
Come, let's talk to him.
130 crore people have taken one step in this regard. Our India will take 130 crore steps towards the freedom of the competitive and competitive plans.
My dear brother, thank you very much.
Many congratulations to you, your team and this new concept.
I want to remember one thing beforehand.
But some people have time to start training, some programmes have time to plan.
My dear countrymen, by 2022, you must be remembered from the Red Fort on 15th August that you should travel to 15 places in India.
Make a plan to stay for at least one night or two in at least 15 places.
You see India, understand, feel.
My dear countrymen, once again I extend my best wishes to you all for the various festivals of India full of diversity.
Yes.
On the occasion of Deepawali, you should also pay attention to bursting fire or not being dangerous for people.
We need more precautions.
Together, let us celebrate new dreams and new resolves with enthusiasm.
Good luck once more.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to interact with children from Karnataka.
He urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country at a function organized by the Times Group on the occasion of Children's Day.
And they published the letters they chose.
I was very happy when I read those letters.
These little children know the problems of the country.
They know what's happening in the country.
Kirti Hegde from Uttaranchal... congratulated Digital India and Smart City projects and said that the child has to change our education system.
If we give children the knowledge of nature, perhaps it can benefit a lot in the future for the protection of the environment.
Reeda Nadaf from a place named Laxmeshwar writes that she is proud of being a soldier's daughter.
No Indian should be proud of our soldiers
And it's natural to be proud of the soldier's daughter too.
Irfana Begum from Calburgi has written that the school is 5 km away from home, hence it has to leave home early and it is very late at night.
He says he can't spend time with his friends and he wants to have a school nearby.
But I loved the establishment of that letter to me, so I could read those letters.
I had a nice experience.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1949, the Constitution of India was adopted on the same day.
The Constitution came into existence on January 26, 1950, so we celebrate that day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day to remember the members of the Constitution.
They have spent nearly three years building the Constitution of India.
Those who read about this discussion will feel proud of what was the thinking of those dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they have worked to create a constitution of our country full of diversity
When the country gets rid of slavery, how much discriminatory and long-sighted they have expressed
There is no region of life that doesn't touch, no matter in nature.
Equality and compassion for all is the face of our Constitution.
It is our duty to keep the Constitution intact.
We must move forward with the feelings of the Constitution, whether it is citizen or ruler.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should be harmed in any way.
17 different committees were formed based on key issues in this Constitution.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He was a great participant.
On December 6, we remember and remember him as usual on his Mahanirvana.
Baba Sahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
15th December is the holy day of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Sardar Patel became a potter from the farmer son of the country and made a very extraordinary effort to harvest the country.
Sardar Saheb was also a Member of the Constitution.
He was the Chairman of the Advisory Councils for the welfare of the fundamental rights, fundamental rights, minorities, minorities and tribals.
Remembers and commemorates brave citizens, police and security personnel and those who lost their lives that day.
This country can never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism is taking a dreadful shape in all parts of the world today, in a way, a day-long event.
We have been suffering from terrorism for the past 40 years in India.
Thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism is challenging humanism.
This is the land of non-violence and affection for the world through Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi.
Terrorism and terrorism undertake a cruel attempt to weaken our social relations.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to be more conscious of humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Navy Day and Navy Day on December 9.
You all know that our culture has grown on the river banks.
This country has an incredible bond with our land and oceans.
When we turned our eyes towards history, 800-900 years ago, the Cola naval forces were considered to be the most powerful naval force.
Their navy played a vital role in making them the economic superpower of the times in the growth of the Cholasam kingdom.
Several examples of the initiatives and investigations of the Chola navigation can be seen collectively.
Very few people know that most of the naval forces in the world had allowed women in very late warships.
However, in the Chola Navy, 800-900 years ago, a large number of women had played an important role.
Women participated in the war.
The Chola rulers knew very well about shipbuilding.
When we talk about the Navy, who can forget the valour he showcased in making the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy.
The Konkan coast was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Janjira and Golden Durga were either on the seashore or surrounded by the sea.
The security of these forts was the Maratha Naval Force.
There were large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
Their navy was capable of attacking any enemy and defending the country from the enemies.
How can we not remember Kanhaji Angre when we talk about the Maratha Navy
He brought the Maratha Navy to a new head, and built Maratha Naval Force bases at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy showcased their traditions in various tournaments, including during the redemption of Goa, during the 1971 India-Pakistan war.
When we talk about the Navy, the war is visible, but the Navy of India has come forward with the same enthusiasm in humanitarian matters.
Sumitra immediately helped save the people and handed over a large number of fishermen to Bangladesh safely from the sea.
In May-June this year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our Navy arrived there and helped the government and the people there.
On November 21, when a trade barrier was stolen in the West Gulf, INS Trikand came to assist.
Our navy has been doing a proud job to provide healthcare services to Fuji, to provide immediate relief and humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country at a critical time, and we are always proud of our security forces and honour them.
Whether it is the army or the Navy or the Air Force... all Indians bow down to the courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live peacefully for the hundred and fifty crore people.
Every year on December 7, the Army is celebrating the flag day.
This is a day of pride and honour for the soldiers of the country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to organize a programme from 1st to 7th December, to provide information to the people about the Armed Forces and to make people aware.
Children and adults must wear flags throughout the week.
There must be a movement of respect for the army in the country.
You can call soldiers in schools and colleges and get information about the army from them.
Our new generation can make it a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This opportunity is to contribute to the good of all the soldiers of our Armed Forces.
This money is being used for the rehabilitation of the families of soldiers who were heroic in the war through the Sainik Welfare Board for the help of injured soldiers.
Let us contribute ourselves for their good.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters something.
Soil is a great part of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this land.
In a way, the food chain is only connected to the soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no harvest soil in this world.
I'm afraid of thinking.
Our culture has thought about it a long time ago, but we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a natural effort to have devotion and gratitude to the soil, on the other hand, scientific projects were part of life to keep the soil nutritional.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to the soil and maintenance of the soil in a scientific manner.
We are proud that the farmers of our country are connected with traditions, and are interested in modern science, and are trying to take appropriate decisions.
I heard about the farmers of Taheu village in Bhoramd Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The cultivation of the soil has come down gradually and the productivity of the soil has come down.
Some farmers in the village understood the seriousness of this situation and advised them to give how many chemicals, other fabrics, micro nutrients and bio-waste by examining their soil at the right time.
You will be surprised to know what was the result of the information received from the soil health test.
And the benefits of the soil increased.
Farmers are beginning to feel that if we want to think about crops then we should first think about earthquake and if we are willing to wait for the earthquake then the landlord will be waiting for us.
Our farmers have made more than 10 crore soil health cards in the country to know the soil well and to harvest it accordingly.
We have devotion to the empire, but do you think how harmful the health of the empire is due to chemicals like urea
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific ways that the mother has serious illness due to excessive use of urea.
Can our farmers make a decision for the children of our soil to utilise half of the urea used in farming today when it is 75 years of independence in 2022
We have started to feel global warming and climate change.
There was a time when it started getting cold before the Deepavali.
Now, in early December, the cold has slowly moved.
The 8-year-old unspeakable boy made Visil his weapon.
Walking up at 5 o'clock in the morning, sitting in the houses of the village, whispering people and asking them not to defecate in the open space.
This child, who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught about cleanliness, left the village of Kumharari free from open defecation.
The small child Tushar has done inspiring things to promote cleanliness.
Our divine brothers and sisters are determined, capable and brave.
We'll get to learn something in the second.
Today they work well in every field.
Whether it is in sports or in any competition or in any social movement, our divine people are not far behind.
Our divine sportspersons, Rio Olympics, won four medals with a good performance, and you all remember that the blind had a champion in the World Cup.
Different types of competitions are held across the country.
Last day, the National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in this and displayed their skills.
One of them is Giger Teacher from Gujarat and 80 percent of his body does not have muscles.
He was chosen by the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics as a result of his skills.
He is one of the 32 Para Swimmers trained at the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar.
My greetings to the Giger Teacher... and my best wishes to him.
Today, Divyanggar can reach any field and it is especially focused on opportunities.
It is our endeavour to make the country capable and create a society inclusive of all.
After a few days, Id-e-Milad-Un-Nabi will be celebrated.
Prophet Hazrat Muhammad Saheb was born on this day.
My heartfelt good wishes to all fellow citizens.
This suggestion is very good, but I think it's very good to add something to this suggestion and make changes.
The elders of our village always say.
Forget the sorrows, don't forget the good.
Can't you guarantee your role in this
Come, let us share good wishes in the Narendra Modi App, MyGov or in the Positive India (Hashtag Positive India) on social media.
Let the others remember what is inspired.
Remembering good things makes you feel better.
It'll be the energy to do good things.
Let us together see the strength of this united edge and its catastrophe.
There'll be a lot of things to say.
PM on October 29, 2017
In Chhath Puja, the sun, water and water are important, but utensils and vegetation made of bamboo and soil are essential for its worship.
In this festival of faith, the message of worship of sunrise and sunset is full of unparalleled culture.
The world will honour and worship those who are born.
But the Chhath Puja is a message to the sure people.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also associated with this festival.
People are very enthusiastic about cleaning the entire house before the Chhath and cleaning the banks of rivers, lakes and ponds, i. e.
It is a celebration of sunrise or Chhath Puja, environment conservation, disease prevention and discipline.
It is natural for everyone to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
You might have been happy to hear that this kind of business has taken place in a store of Khadi and Handloom.
The sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation during Diwali was about 680 per cent.
The total sale of Khadi and Artificial Instruments has been around 90 per cent this year compared to last year.
This shows that today youngsters, women and people of all ages like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how many families, the poor families and the families working in the leaflet have benefited from this.
He says we should also remember our brave security forces.
We also want to bring home sweets to the Jawans.
I once again had the privilege of celebrating Diwali with the brave security personnel deployed on the border.
This time, I had an unforgettable experience of celebrating Diwali with the security personnel at the Gures Sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security personnel are waiting for the country, honouring all the soldiers of our security forces for fighting, dedication, sacrifice, sacrifice and for all the countrymen.
If we get a chance, we must listen to their proud stories to know the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us don't know that the soldiers of our security forces are not only on our borders but also playing an important role in establishing peace all over the world.
They are increasing the scope of Hindustan all over the world as per the UN Peace Peace Prize.
On 24th October, the United Nations celebrated the UN Day.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in the world and their active role.
We consider the Vasudhaiva Kumbh, that is, the whole world is our family.
With this belief, India has been actively involved in various important steps of the United Nations since its inception.
India has always given importance to women's sovereignty and humanitarianism of the United Nations is a living example of this.
Initially, it was proposed in the edition that all men were born free and equitable. As a result of the efforts of India's representative Hamza Mehta, the sentence was accepted by all men as free and equitable.
Looks like it's not a very simple change, but it's a healthy thought.
The biggest contribution made by India under the United Nations is the peace mission of the United Nations.
India has always actively participated in UN peacekeeping missions.
Some of you know this for the first time.
More than 160 Indian security personnel have served in UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about 7,000 Indian soldiers are associated with the UN peacekeeping issues, of which India is the third largest in the world.
By 27th August, Indian soldiers have provided their services in about 50 missions across the UN peacekeeping world.
These missions were in different parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Labanon and Sudan.
In Kongo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients were treated in Indian Army hospitals and saved innumerable people.
The security forces of India not only saved the people there in different countries, but also conquered their minds through public health measures.
Indian women have played a leading role in establishing peace.
Many people don't know that India is the first country to send women police teams to the UN peacekeeping mission in Libya.
This process of India has become a source of inspiration for countries around the world.
After that, all countries started sending their women police teams.
You will be surprised to hear that India's role is not only in compliance but also in training the peacekeeping community in almost 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
The peace mission actions are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work in difficult areas.
I'll have to live among different people.
We must understand and understand different conditions and different cultures.
We have to change ourselves according to local needs and conditions.
Who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salariya when we remember our brave UN peacekeepers today
Remembering him, all Indians will be proud to chest.
In 1989, at the age of seventy-two, he became the Operation Force Commander in Namibia, who served the country's freedom struggle.
General Timmaya, the head of the Indian Army, led the United Nations peacekeeping in Cyprus, sacrificed his life for peace.
India has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony all over the world as a peacekeeper.
It is our belief that everyone must live in peace and harmony and lead to the creation of a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land was blossomed by the great men who served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagini Nivedita, was one of those extraordinary people.
While living in the name of Margaret Elizabeth Noble in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda gave them the name Nivedita.
The word Nivedita is completely dedicated.
Then they dedicated themselves to the name and made the name right.
Yesterday was Sister Nivedita's 100th Anniversary.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives with the influence of Swami Vivekananda and serve the poor.
Sister Nivedita suffered injustice to the British rule.
Not only did the British slave our country, but they tried to make us mentally slaves.
They were constantly striving to create indifference in our country by showing our culture.
Bhagini re-established the pride of educated Indian culture.
The revolutionary poetry of Subrahmanya Bharati, a famous nationalist and Tamil poet, is famous for women empowerment.
It is said that Goddess is inspired.
Jagdish Chandra Bose, an eminent scientist, collaborated with him.
They helped in the process of boss research through articles and conferences.
India's special beauty is the spirituality and science in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Jagdish Chandra Bose are strong examples of this.
Hundreds of people died when a terrible plague stretched out in Kolkata in 1899.
Sister Nivedita started cleaning work on drains and roads without considering her health.
Sister Nivedita, a woman who had left for serving the poor, could have lived a happy life.
Inspired by their sacrifice, people came forward to cooperate in service matters.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, I extend my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the greatest heroes and dogs in the creation of a New India.
Your concern is that the sickness that adults had previously suffered, and the disease that occurred in the evening of life has started to appear in the children recently.
It is surprising to hear that children are infected with diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are said to be lifestyle disorders.
The main cause of such diseases is the lack of physical activity in the lifestyle i. e.
Society and families have to pay attention to this.
I don't need to do anything special about this.
It's only for yourself to habit them properly, smoothly, smoothly.
Instead of going up and descending on the lift of children make a habit of walking stairs .
After dinner, try to take the entire family with the children.
Yoga for Young India, Yoga for Youth India.
I'm practicing it, I'm saying that any old man can easily do it.
It's simple to learn disappointment, and it's simple to say that it can be done anywhere.
It doesn't need to be specially equipment or field.
There are several studies on how much Yoga benefits in controlling diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives, not as a medium of treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I have received good news from sports in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have played a very important role in different sports.
In Hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey crown through a good game.
Our sportspersons played a very good role, so India was able to become Asia Cup champions after 10 years.
Earlier, India had won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My dear countrymen, many good wishes to the entire team and the support staff.
After Hockey, India has heard good news in the Batminton too.
Batminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has made the Indians proud by winning the open crown of Denmark.
After Indonesia Open and Australian Open, Super Series won the Crown.
I congratulate our young friends for this achievement and enhancing India's pride.
Friends, FIFA Under 17 World Cup matches were held this month.
The teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their skills in the football field.
I also had a chance to see a game.
The sportspersons and the sights were very enthusiastic.
World Cup competitions have been successfully organised and all teams have shown their best.
The young sportspersons of India have lost their hearts even though they cannot get the crown of India.
India also enjoyed the festival of this game all over the world and the tournament was attractive and charming for football lovers.
The future of the football has begun to show signs of excitement.
I once again convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons, to all those who have worked with them.
Some send photos of children's missions in this regard, some will be a story of the youth's collective efforts.
A team of government organizations called the Eco-technical Protection Organization (ESO) came out to clean up the Chandrapur Fort.
In this work for a period of two and a half days, people continued to clean up the fort as a group of people who were not tired.
I was surprised to see the picture that those who were disappointed about the dream of cleanliness and despaired of seeing the evils around you, I would like to tell you that the youth of the Ecological Protection Organization, their sweat, their enthusiasm and their determination will be seen in those active pictures.
Your disappointment, your faith.
This auspicious effort for cleanliness is a marvellous example of beauty, inclusion and patience.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on November 4th.
By eating food together, people feel unity and equality.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has given three messages for a true life - awakening the name of Paramatma, awakening and helping the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev composed the master to tell him.
In the coming 2019, we are going to observe the 550th year of Guru Nanak Dev.
Come on, let's try to move forward through the path of his message and his lessons.
My dear countrymen, after two days on 31st October we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he is the founder of modern India.
If we travel through the unusual life of that great son of India, we can learn a lot.
His expertise was to bring thoughts into action.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the backbone of India's deeds in a lure.
He asserted that crores of Indians should be brought under the purview of a nation, a constitution.
He gave him the power to overcome all obstacles in his firm decision.
He had set a goal, moved forward and moved towards that goal.
He could have done this task of uniting the country.
Everyone was an equal nation in his vision.
I want to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel always inspires us.
These words of Sardar Sab are still inspiring and familiar with our vision of New India.
That's why his birthday is celebrated as the national loneliness day.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this festival of mutually beneficial mutually benevolent Festival for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with a new imagination, with a new determination, you all will return to your daily life.
My best wishes to the countrymen for their dreams.
The Mann Ki Baat programme, which you have been able to understand through Akashwani, has completed three years.
Today is thirty-sixth episode.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can say a little about those who send their minds from all corners of the country, but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of them inspire me.
Something about reforms in government affairs.
Perhaps there will be personal complaints and sometimes it will attract attention to social problems.
Whenever I say Mann Ki Baat, I remember what Acharya Vinoba Bhave said.
I am sure that after three years, sociologists, universities, researchers and media persons will make this hungry discovery.
I am sure that this discussion will be more useful to Mann Ki Baat in the future and will get a new energy and new energy.
Mann Ki Baat had said that we should take as much as we need when we eat.
But letters from all corners of the country, from social organisations and youth have come to this point.
Thereafter, many people have come forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Not only in India but also in the world, the Self-With Doter programme has become a big initiative.
This is not just a problem in social media.
A new self-confidence, a new pride for all the women.
Every parents started feeling selfie for their own daughter.
All the girls started feeling that you have importance and importance.
Last day I was discussing with the Union Tourism Department...
I told those who left for tourism that wherever they went, they wanted to contact India and send photographs.
Millions of photographs and pictures of every corner of India have been a big gain for those who work in the tourism sector in a way.
I was convinced of the fact that the small event had become a mass movement in Mann Ki Baat.
Recalling that it's been three years, the events in the last three years appeared in the mindset.
The country is moving forward in the right direction.
It's a big capital for any country, a great power.
I bow down to the people in my heart.
Once I talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi is not a dress but a thought-tank.
Young people are interested in glasses, swords, woodpeckers... with tail khadi.
Khadi's sales have increased, so the poor's house is directly linked to employment.
The Khadik Rebate is given from 2nd October, which is very low.
This will give strength to the poor in our country, we must do it.
With this interest in Khadi, people working in the Khadi sector have been encouraged to think in a new way in Khadi, Khadi related to the government.
How can we bring new technologies, how can we increase productivity, how can we bring solar energy
The ancient legacy has been decayed for 20, 25, 30 years... and how it can be revived.
A variety of things have been added.
Several renowned job opportunities were created.
Kashmir has revived its training wing, locked up by Khadi Gramodyog Division in Pampore, Kashmir has a lot to contribute to the region.
The resumption of this training centre will help new generations to manufacture, generate, generate new products.
Normal people have started offering Khadi products as gifts to others.
We can feel directly how a product can be encouraged naturally.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in the Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate the 15 days of Gandhi Jayanti across the country.
It is said that cleanliness will connect with the masses.
Our Hon'ble President has initiated this and joined the nation.
Today, everybody has become a part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the old people, men, women, cities and villages.
I thank the Hon'ble President.
All sections of the country have considered this as their own and all are connected with it.
Whether it is a sports person, a film industry, academia, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officials, government employees, police or military, all are associated with this.
There has been a change in public places to prevent others from polluting public places, where people working there have started feeling a bit of pressure.
It is a matter of great pleasure that in the first four days of Swachhata Hi Seva movement, more than 75 lakh people have joined the work related to more than 40,000 initiatives.
This time we're cleaning up one place, and others care not to be cautious...
But if cleanliness is to be a habit then it must be transformed into an emotional way.
This time, along with 'Swachhata Hi Seva', the festival also took place.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the article on cleanliness.
Thousands of children have painted colors.
When it comes to cleanliness, I don't forget to thank the media persons.
They have purifyed this people with utmost sanctity.
They have contributed immensely in their own way to create a progressive environment.
A few days ago someone turned my attention to the work of the 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
When you talk about Brandi Ambassador, you will think that he will be the hero of the Sports Sector.
On seeing plastic, polythene, utilized cotton and other litres, the bilal removes it, thereby making a little earning.
Billal's Corps ration carried out a vehicle and gave a uniform, and he went to other areas to tell people the lessons of cleanliness, inspire them and remains after it until the results are seen.
Bilal Dar is an inspiration for everybody interested in hygiene.
I appreciate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must admit that the history of the future is born in the womb of the present history and when it comes to history, it is natural for me to remember the great men.
This month of October is the month of remembering many great men.
In October this month, we have seen many hardships for the country, from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who led us and led us for the 21st century.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal Jisa.
What was the central point of all these great men
There was a common thing - live for the country, do something for the country...
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji and Deendayal ji are far away from the corridors of power, but they lived with the lives of the people and worked for them.
Deendayal Upadhyay and Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the last man in the society.
Sardar Sab united the country.
We have to take forward the unity that runs for unity.
You must feel the diversity of this India, touch it, feel its aroma.
You will see that these diversities of our country work as a great curriculum for the development of your personality.
The days of holidays, the days of Diwali... we have the habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
Tourist journey is natural.
But it is a matter of imagination that we do not see our country, we do not know the diversity of the country, we do not understand it, but it is interesting to travel abroad suddenly under the influence of color.
The people of western India do not know what is in the eastern India.
How many varieties are our country
Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalamji, when they performed a madness in India then they got a new inspiration to see and understand India and to live and die for them.
All these great men have travelled in weight.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
He tried to fulfil India.
Can we, as a student, try to embrace our different states, different communities, people, their ways of life, their traditions and their disciplines and their dietary values to understand and understand their understanding
The value addition to tourism is not just because we see it, but as a student, it is learning and trying to become a part of it.
In my own experience, I have got the opportunity to go to more than 500 districts of the country.
In more than 450 districts, I have the chance to stay in the night...
Today, when I take this responsibility in this country, I feel very useful for that journey.
I'm comfortable understanding things.
I appeal to you that you not only feel the unity of the diversity of this vast India as a mudra, but as a pillar of our immense strength.
This is the dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food habits are there
You'll never have to repeat if you eat all your life for a whole day.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism sector.
You don't want to go out of the house during these holidays, you don't want to get out for a change, you know something and understand something.
The inclusion of India is the diversity of crores of people.
Your life will be more prosperous through these experiences.
The limits of your thinking will be broad.
Who is the greater guru than experience
Normally, it is time to travel from October to March.
People are traveling.
I believe that if you go this time, you will take this moment forward.
Share your experiences wherever you go, share pictures.
Send a picture on the subject Hash Tag Incredibleindia.
Send photos of it if you can interfere with the people on the way.
Not only the buildings, but also the beauty of nature, but also the pictures of the people's life there.
Write a good article about the journey.
Send it to Mai Gavi, send it to Narendra Modi App.
I feel that it will be better to encourage tourism in India by identifying the best seven tourist destinations of your state and informing all Indians about those seven places or seven things.
If you can go to those seven places.
Can you give me some information about it
Make a film about such good places, make a video, make a publicity and encourage them - the government will accept these things that you find.
You can also be an inspiration to promote tourism from October to March.
I invite you for that.
My mind is deeply impressed.
I'm a man like you, too.
You must have noticed something that happened in the past and people have seen a divine example of women power and patriotism.
The extraordinary nature of this is that the husbands of the Fund and the Fund are sacrificed by serving the Mother of India.
Can we imagine what mood will be if we don't live in this young age
But the great freedom fighter of the martyrdom colonel Anand Mahadek made this difficult situation in mind and joined the Indian Army.
He was trained well for 11 months and changed his life to realise his dream.
His wife Nidhi took a firm decision and joined the army.
It is natural for all people to have respect for these heroes.
I convey my best wishes to the two sisters.
They have inspired millions of people of the country with new inspiration and passion.
Many greetings to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our younger generation between Navratri Festival and Diwali.
Fifth Under-17 World Cup is going on in our country.
I'm sure there'll be a football all around.
Every generation will have more interest in football.
My dear countrymen, this is Navaratri.
It's time to worship Durgam Bai.
The atmosphere is spreading pure and pure fragrance.
All around is the atmosphere of spirituality, festival and devotion.
Festival of power is believed to be a festival.
When India is 75 years of its independence in 2022, let us move forward by preparing a roadmap for five years to realise the dream of freedom fighters, the determination of hundred twenty-five crore people, the supreme effort, determination and determination.
Thanks a lot.
English rendering of the text of PMs address on the eve of 27th August, 2017 at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen bow down with respect.
On the one hand, when the country drowns in festivals, on the other hand, on the other hand, the news of violence from any part of Hindustan is natural.
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel who has spent his life for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, Ahimsa and mutual respect, which is part of our minds.
We have been saying that Ahimsa is a phenomenon since childhood.
In the name of faith, I had said from the Red Fort that violence will not be allowed to believe in religion or political belief or tradition.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's Constitution provides for justice to every person.
This country will never let those who hold the law, those who sell in the way of violence, whether it is individual or society, no government will allow it.
Everyone has to bow before the law.
The law determines responsibility and punishes the guilty.
Our country is full of diversity, these varieties are not merely in food matters, lifestyles or indulgence.
We can see diversity at all levels of life.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
The cultural heritage of our centuries-old cultural heritage can be seen in view of cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, but in 365 days there will be no celebration of any day.
On seeing all our festivals, we can see an unprecedented festival associated with the timelines of nature.
Everything is directly related to nature.
Several of our festivals are associated with the farmers and are directly related to the fishing community.
Today, when I talk about festivals, I would like to say sorry to you for the first time.
Yesterday's celebration of 'Savtsari' was held in the Jain community.
In the Jain community, the festival of 'Tourism' is held in the month of Bhadra.
The last day of the festival is the day of celebration.
This is really a surprising tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and filth.
This is called 'Khamavani' festival, which is a tradition of greeting each other with 'Goodness'.
In our sciences, the pardon of heroism, that is, the pardon of heroine.
He that forgives is a hero.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, 'It is the specialty of a strong person to forgive.'
Shakespeare noted the significance of forgiveness in the film 'Marchant of Venice', which he wrote, "Mercy Essays Twiss Blast, It Blast Himself Gives Him Daughter Takes, which means forgiving and forgiving and blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time when Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in every corner of Hindustan.
The Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations take place for ten days.
This festival is a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for the Ganesh Festival.
Now it is time to celebrate Hon'ble in Kerala.
Kerala is one of the most important festivals in India.
This is important for social and cultural.
Onam will showcase the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival offers a message of love and harmony in the society and offers new zeal, new ideas and new confidence to the people.
Now this festival is becoming an instrument for encouraging tours.
The festival of Navratri in Gujarat and the Durga Puja festival in Bengal have become an attraction in a way .
Our festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners like this.
Think about what we can do in this matter.
A few days later, Idul Suha will also be celebrated.
With festivals becoming symbols of devotion and faith, we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
My dear countrymen, the definition of modernization is changing.
A variety of experiments take place in every family.
Look at how big a change is, how happy it is.
As I said, the country is full of intellectual awakening.
I'm glad to know about someone's new invention.
Someone said that an engineer had collected some special type of soil and was imparting training to build a Ganesh virus.
When the genus is poured in a small pearl of water, it gets mixed in water quickly.
He didn't stop it.
The Swachhta Mission will be launched three years ago on 2nd October, 2019.
Its results have started to appear.
The toilets were 39 percent now 67 percent.
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have been declared Open Defecation Free.
Many lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water came, the waste was spread everywhere.
We can create an environment of cleanliness across the country.
After constructing the toilet, you will join your own name and your family in the portal.
You can write articles in different languages, no age limits.
You can make short films on your mobile.
Create a 2-3 minute short film that inspires cleanliness.
In any language, it can be a silent picture.
Work yourself as a part of this.
You will see how shiny it will be on 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti.
After this 15-day long waste-building, on 2nd October, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, we can enjoy the sacred joy of paying homage to Hon'ble Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to clarify a special commitment to you.
I look forward to your message with greater eagerness than you are waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
I'm just waiting for everything you say to me to learn something.
There's a chance to change what I'm doing.
I use your little things to think of many things with a new perspective.
"Prime woman, I'm talking off Pune.
I once went shopping with her in the mall.
She spent a simple amount of Rs 2,000, spent Rs 450 for a pizza.
But he argued with the auto driver for going to the mall for five rupees.
Buying vegetables on the way back, the price has also been saved by Rs. 4-5.
I felt very bad.
We don't even ask questions about the price in bigger places, but we argue with our brothers and sisters who depend on us for a little bit of money.
They're incredible.
You must talk about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful to you for giving me a great message through this heart-breaking phone call.
I am sure that if my people get this habit in the behaviour of the poor, it will definitely be abandoned.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the country is celebrating sports day.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand, the great hockey player, who was indulged in Hockey.
His contributions to Hockey were unbalanced.
I am saying this because of the willingness of our younger generation to connect with sports.
The games must be part of our lives.
If we consider ourselves a young nation in the world, we must see our children in sports.
Sports is a physical fitness, administrative alertness, personality management.
What's more than this
The games are a great medicine for the unity of minds in a way.
Sports talent search portal has been prepared by the Ministry of Sports to find and enable them.
Any child in the country who has made any benefit in the sports sector can upload the video if he wants his personal experience.
The Portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports by selecting the growing sportspersons.
May the youth be happy to know that the 17th World Cup will be held in India from October 6th to 18th.
24 teams worldwide are going to make India their home.
We are all inspired by the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of those six girls who work in the navy.
These six girls left for the sea in a small boat called INS Tarini.
This is called Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India after months touring the whole world.
These six children travel bravely among the waves in the sea, for the first time in the world.
These girls have many good wishes and blessings.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we are celebrating Teachers Day.
He was the President.
But he himself was a teacher.
He was a scholar, a diplomat, an enthusiastic teacher in every sense, even though he lived as the President of India.
I bow to him.
The great scholar, Albert Einstein, said It is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to Awaken oy in creative expression and knowledge among his students is the greatest benefit of a teacher.
Shouldn't we take a decision this time when we celebrate teachers' day
Can you organize a campaign like a mission
Teach to Transform, ducate to mpower, learn to teach for change, strengthen and guide.
Can we take this mission forward with this determination
It is a matter of great pleasure that everybody takes a pledge for 5 years, guides to achieve it, gains it in five years and succeeds in life.
For this, create an environment for our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk about transformation in our country, we remember a teacher in the society as we remember mother in our family.
Teachers have an important role in transforming.
One thing that could transform somebody's life through cooperative efforts must have happened in the lives of all the teachers.
If we strive together, we can play a big role in transforming the nation.
Let's move forward with the mantra of teaching for transformation.
Reproduction is an important woman.
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in Mumbai city and work for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in economic inclusion programme and related social programmes.
I want to ask you whether India is more economically secure and stronger than the Jan Dhan Yojana, which started in 2014, after three years, will it be possible to say that empowerment and facilities are available to our women, farmers, workers and villages
With a dream in mind, it was launched on 28th August 2014.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed by 3 years on 28th August, 2018.
30 crore new families have been linked to this and bank accounts have been opened.
It is more than the population of many countries of the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have invested around Rs. 60,000 crore in banks.
The Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana, Pradhan Mantri SurakshaBimaYojana, is creating a new faith in the lives of the poor.
When the poor suffered the loss of life of the head of the family, some families received two lakh rupees within a few days due to insurance of one rupee.
They will get inspiration from it, and hundreds of examples have come to me about how a scheme transforms the lives of a person, how new energy is filled and how new faith is filled.
They can interact with such people and inspire the new generation.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to Mr.
Thank you very much.
Mankind's specialty is that the rainy season is very attractive.
There are very negative conditions as a result of changing climate and environment.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, especially in the North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, people have suffered a lot due to these years.
The State Governments are making possible efforts to assist the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organizations, cultural organisations and citizens working with the spirit of service are doing their best to help people in this environment.
Soldiers, Air Force, NDRF and paramilitary forces from the Government of India are working hard to help flood victims.
People's lives are very thirsty due to floods.
The NDRF team was deployed.
Climate warnings are almost accurate due to technological advancements and advancements in technologies.
As per the climate signal, if the timelines for our actions are changed gradually, then we can avoid major disasters.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country are more prepared for it than me.
I heard your speech on Chartered Accountants' Day and I was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched on the same day last month.
I am glad to hear that there is a shortage of goods in the north-eastern regions and far-flung hills, if a person living in the forests is really scared of me, then I feel simple and simple when I write a letter saying that now things have started to understand.
The time has come down from one place to another and the busyness of the highways is very low.
The speed of trucks has reduced pollution.
Goods are quickly on target.
The speed at which this transformation took place, the speed at which it moved from one way to another, the new registrations took place, has created a new faith throughout the country.
Once again, I am confident that the economists, management experts and technologists will come up with research and research in front of the world on the implementation of GST in India.
A case study will be created for all the universities in the world.
Because this huge change in such a large quantity, with the participation of crores of people, it has brought us to the forefront of success and success in such a large country.
The world must learn about it.
Implementation of this GST has the role of all the states and the responsibility of all the states.
All the decisions were taken by the States and the Central Government together.
How big a dream of One Nation One Tax has been achieved.
In the matter of GST, I have seen how the officers from the village to the center worked with dedication, how well the government and businessmen have created a harmonious environment between the government and the consumers and how they have played a major role in increasing their faith.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries, all the Departments and all the officers of the Central and State Governments.
GST is an excellent example of the success of India's social power.
It's a history.
In a way, this is a step towards social reform.
I reiterate my heartfelt gratitude to millions of countrymen for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of the revolution.
On August 15, 1947, the country was free.
In the month of August, many incidents have been related to the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Bharat Chodo Andalan (Kwit India Movement).
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people joined the freedom struggle, tried and suffered.
The shores of history are an inspiration for a grand India.
The people of India have gathered together against the British rule.
According to Mahatma Gandhi's request, lakhs of Indians were dedicated to the struggle for life with the mantra of "employment or death".
Millions of youth of the country have asked for their studies and books.
They got off after hearing the fate of freedom.
While on the 9th of August, Mahatma Gandhi had issued a call called Bharat Chodo, the British Government had dissolved all the great leaders and during that period, the second generation leader of the country Dr.
Men like Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan have become expedients.
There was public opinion behind all this success, peoples talent, peoples determination, peoples struggle.
This effort, from 1857 to 1942, brought this struggle to its peak in 1942.
Within five years, in 1947, the British had to leave India through 'Bharat Chodo'.
I want to connect you with this math.
We got freedom in 1947.
It's 2017.
About 70 years.
The governments have come.
There were successes.
Hopes arose.
From 1942 to 1947, it was a decisive year to achieve determination.
From 2017 to 2022, five years have come to us to achieve this goal with determination and let us celebrate the 15th of August, 2017 as an opportunity for our determination.
Crores of determinations.
Let's try to fulfil millions of determinations.
We have to make a determination.
2017 must be our dream year.
May this month be part of the determination.
Today, it is not necessary to work or die, but to join the New India vision, to work with the mind and the body to achieve success.
Any decision that can be achieved within the next five years.
Social discussions can be organised by young organizations, students' organizations, government-sponsored organisations.
Let's bring forward new ideas.
Where do we get as a nation
What can be my contribution as a person
With the help of technology, come forward with video, post, blog, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will also launch the uititya uiz for the youth.
This problem is an attempt to connect the youth with the pride of the country and introduce the freedom fighters.
You must give it an extensive propaganda and bring it to the people.
I invite you this time too, surely in the MyGov app or in the Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to tell you about it as long as I get it on 15th August.
I think he's finished in 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, today I want to say one more thing.
India has a socio-economic philosophy.
We don't want to see it at all.
Our festivals and festivals are not just occasions for happiness.
Our festivals and festivals are the efforts of social reform.
It connects the individual and the society.
Thousands of jobs are associated with this festival, including those who make Rakhis, those who sell Rakhis, and those who sell sweets.
This is why the families of our dear brothers and sisters live.
We burn the lamps for Deepawali - it's not just a festival of light, it's not just a festival or adornment of houses.
It is directly linked to the poor families that produce soil wrinkles.
But today, when I talk about the festivals and the economic status of the poor people associated with them, I would also like to talk about the environment.
When I see that the people of this country are more vigilant and more efficient than ever.
For the past one month, aware citizens have written letters to me about the environment.
They have requested that there should be an opportunity to put forward the plan to favour the soil-filled gas in the Ganesh Chaturthi.
I'm obliged to be cautious.
This time I'm predicting it.
I'm sure you'll be with me in this.
This will help the sculptures and poor artists and they will get employment through the creation of idols.
Fill the poor's stomach.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor, connect with the economic conditions of the poor, let us celebrate the joy of our festival, let us try this.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we see the girls of our country moving towards the country, either in the education sector or in the economic sector or in the field of social affairs or in the sports sector.
We, the people of this country feel proud of our girls.
Last day our girls performed well in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
The pressure appeared on their faces.
I've evaluated things in another way in that conversation.
I said, "Look, there is a lot of hope in this period of media."
Whether you win the game or not, you have won the hearts of about 150 crore people.
The youth of the country, especially our girls, are actually doing a lot to enhance the race of our country.
I once again convey my heartfelt congratulations to the younger generation of the country, especially to our girls.
My dear countrymen, I recall the August Revolution and remind you of August 9 again, August 15 again.
Recalling the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.
Resolve, all the citizens of the country, and all the citizens of the country prepare five years for their dreams.
We have to bring the country to new heights, take it.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move forward with confidence that the future of the country will be bright.
The weather is changing.
Climate has become smooth due to the good rainfall in many parts of the country.
The cold winds after the rains have been relieved of the heat in the past days.
Whatever hurdles in life, however difficult it is in its own life or in public life, the rainy season changes our mentality.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated in many parts of the country with great respect and happiness.
Now, in many parts of the world, the festival of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated.
Those who have learnt about Baba Saheb Ambedkar, may be aware that he had highly appreciated the temple of Lord Jagannath and the traditions there, because they include social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
A very few people know the word Jagarnat in English, which means that no one can stop it.
Looking at the meaning of this Jagarnatt, this word is articulated in the story of Lord Jagannath.
Let us know from this that how the world has given its own importance to Jagannath's chariotic journey.
Everyone celebrated Ramzan's holy month with admiration and admiration.
Now Eid is here.
I convey my best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is a month of holy gift, a month of happiness sharing.
In this holy month of Ramsan, I got a glimpse of an inspirational incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Around 3500 families of our Muslim brothers and sisters living in that small village, in a way, the brothers and sisters of the Muslim family will be more than the population.
During this Ramsan, the villagers together decided to build a toilet.
These 17 lakhs will be spent on other requirements of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mumbai for making this holy occasion of Ramzan an opportunity for the betterment of the society.
Every act of them is very inspiring.
The greatest thing is that they have freed Mubarakpur from expulsion.
Three states - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - have already been declared Open Defecation Free States.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were announced this week.
I thank the five states, the government and the authorities and the general public.
Only then will the habit of body and mind change.
That's how clean it is.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
I have noticed something very good in the last day, and I would like to tell you that.
Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
What was the goal
Build 10,000 toilets in 71 village panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen will be happy to know that the common man and the government have successfully completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages are free of open defecation.
In and through the letters, through the sky.
Recalling the era of Trichal Emergency, Smt. Prakash Telugu reminded him of the Black Era of the history of democracy on June 25.
This awakening to democracy is praiseworthy.
Democracy is not just a system, it is a culture.
The price of freedom is a constant awareness.
Continuous awareness is essential in terms of democracy, so we have to recall what is harmful to democracy.
And then we must move towards the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was a democracies and an unforgettable black night.
In a way, the government was turning the country into a caravan.
I beat the voices of the opponent.
Jayaprakash Narayan and other dignitaries of the country were jailed.
The judicial system cannot escape the terrible shadow of the situation.
Press made the newspapers completely ineffective.
Today's journalists, students and people associated with democracy, are constantly trying to increase the awareness of the people about democracy by remembering the black period again and again.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
Atal ji wrote a poem when it was a year after announcing the Emergency, which he depicted in that poem.
My dear countrymen, all Hindustani is proud of the world today.
The 21st of June 2017 has become the world's best.
From the sea to the mountain people welcomed the sun rays of the border.
Which Hindustani would not be proud of this.
Yoga was not before... but when Yoga was slaughtered, Yoga became an eye to the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made Yoga an opportunity.
In China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level in Machu Pindu, the world heritage site in Peru.
People did yoga in the shadow of Imphal Tower in France.
A week long programme was organised at 70 locations in a small country like Singapore.
10 stamps on International Yoga Day were released by the United Nations.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at the United Nations Headquarters.
It was attended by UN officials and diplomats from all over the world.
This time Yoga once again created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about fifty thousand people together made a new world record by doing Yoga.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our armed forces, including BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, have made Yoga a part of the work with their duty.
Some TV channels also proposed it.
The Hon'ble Prime Minister said that in the morning, he has said that instead of giving buckets at various places, good books should be given a gift of memories.
This was started in your reign in Gujarat, but in the next few days the use of buffaloes is more visible.
Can't you do anything
Can't you do anything to enforce this book instead of books
He said that Khadi's Calesa should be encouraged.
This programme continued as long as I was in Gujarat, but after leaving the habit left.
But I met again in this programme in Kerala.
Now one of these reports has begun to be lowered.
Let's make it simple.
Buckal's age is too low.
You're gonna leave after you bought it.
Welcome Khadi's calendar, but it is beneficial for many poor families.
The cost will be low and it will be used properly.
For many years, but Elizabeth's queen has kept the call given by Mahatma Gandhi.
Several kinds of letters are available, many kinds of people are burning.
I'm sure I'm going to tell you about it while reading a letter last day.
In the south, a family from Madurai, Arulmozhi, sent me a letter.
I need to know what that letter was.
I was thinking of some economic activity on children's education, and I thought that the family would have some financial help.
For this, I took loans from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started the work of distributing some goods from the market.
That is, the Government will look into the departments which have been registered in the e-jam.
They have written to me that it's very interesting.
They say, "I got the money under the Mudra scheme, started business and added that I could give it to the e-jam, I got orders from the Prime Minister's Office and from the PMO.
It was a new news for me too.
They pointed out what they bought at the PMO - bought two thermos and received 1600 rupees.
This is empowerment.
This is the opportunity to encourage the business community.
There is transparency, empowerment, and there is industrial harmony.
Government e-market plates-jam.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can glorify our capabilities in the Space Science.
Today, India is not only on the planet but also on the planet.
Two days ago, 30 Nano satellites were launched along with a satellite from ISRO Cartosat-2 Series.
These satellites consisted of 15 countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This Nano Satellite Campaign of India will help in agriculture, farming and natural resources.
We must remember that just a few days ago, the ISRO JISAT was successfully launched.
This is one of the largest satellites launched by India so far.
The papers in our country compared this to the weight of the elephant.
Our scientists can imagine what they have done in the environment.
On June 19, a thousand days of Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
When we successfully discovered the Mangalyaan Mission, this mission was aimed at 6 months.
In the recent past, Indias badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth Indonesia has made the country proud by winning the Open.
T.
Usha's Usha School of Athletics has got the opportunity to connect with the launch of the Synthetic Track.
The more we connect with the games, the more the sportsman spirit grows.
Sports play a very important role in personal development.
Sports has great significance in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If our family and children are interested in sports, they should be encouraged.
We all have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my beloved countrymen, the rainy season and the sustained atmosphere, all together present a new experience.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and I will tell you something else in the next Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of the text of PMs address at the launch of the Special Innovation Movement to the people of India on May 28, 2017 at 11 AM
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramsan has begun.
In the coming of the holy month of Ramsan, I extend my heartfelt good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayers, spirituality and charity are very important.
Ours is a country where those who believe in God deny God, who do idolatry, and those who oppose idolatry.
The art of living together with all traditions, traditions and traditions of all forms of worship.
Religions, castes, customs and traditions are a message of peace and unity and harmony.
The holy month of Ramzan will help us move forward in peace, unity and harmony.
I once again wish you all good luck.
I am very happy that a lot of people have experienced me.
I was encouraged to tell myself what you have to say.
I couldn't read it all, I couldn't hear the messages of all of them.
But I've been looking at all together... some tried to learn music, some tried to learn new rhythms, some try to learn some new things from the UTB, some try to learn new languages.
I'm so glad that a phone call wants to hear you.
I'm talking about Daksha katya.
I had the habit of reading.
But during this holiday I decided to read something.
When we started reading about the freedom struggle, how many sacrifices were required for India's freedom struggle, how many freedom fighters had spent years in prisons.
I inspire Bhagat Singh, who has suffered a lot of sacrifice at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to send a message to the new generation in this regard.
I am glad that the new generation wants to know our history, our freedom fighters and the people who have sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
During the period of Independence, many of the great men in prison have literally done a lot of things.
Their gallows are the strength of India's freedom struggle.
I went to Andaman Nicobar once a year ago.
Cellular went to jail.
This is the birthplace of a hero.
Heroes wrote a book Masi Janmathe in prison.
Writing poems was the prison wall.
He was locked in a small cell.
A light and sound show is very inspiring.
Those from all the states of Hindustan, who speak all the languages, dedicated their lives in the Cellular Jail of Andaman with the passing away of Kalapani.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday.
What do you mean connecting with nature
To connect with nature is to preserve a better planet.
Where is it better than Mahatma Gandhi's words
Mahatma Gandhi often said, We need to take care of the unforeseen world.
Nature has a power.
You must have experienced a glass of water on your face when you get tired.
If you open the windows of the house when you get tired, you can breathe in the wind passing by opening the doors.
When we are in contact with these digestive elements that are built on the body, ourselves have a new chain in our body, a new energy becomes visible.
We've experienced all this, but we don't listen to it, it doesn't touch a corner.
Now, when you come into contact with nature, you must keep in mind if you don't have a new chain inside you.
Therefore, the global drive to engage with the five natures of June 5 has to be carried forward by each one of us.
We have the advantage of protecting our ancestral environment.
If we protect the environment, it will benefit from the upcoming level.
The universal, however, is the greatest guidance for the environment, remembering that it was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth is said to be a son.
It is said in the Vedas that our eternity is due to our land.
The earth is our mother, and our children.
In our country, many festivals, many admirations are associated with the environment.
Whether it is educated, illiterate, urban, rural or tribal, nature-loving love is a part of social life.
We have to make it a new word, we have to describe it for new reasons.
There are numerous news from the States.
In most of the states, there is a big movement in terms of vegetation in the rainy season.
Millions of trees are planting.
Scholarships, social organisations, government-run organisations and circuits.
This time too, we have to encourage tree plantation, give our contributions, dear countrymen.
June 21 is a special day all over the world.
This day is celebrated as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, June 21 has reached every corner of the world, connecting people with each other.
On the one hand, many diverse forces in the world form a form of deformity, so that India contributes a great deal to the world.
Through Yoga, the world has become a corpse.
Today, as the body interconnects mind, mind and soul, Yoga interacts with each other.
Two days ago, I had written letters to all the governments and leaders of the world regarding Yoga.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
Slowly some steps were taken in that regard.
I have received some comments on this and I congratulate those who have sent these comments.
It's very funny.
Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandma, Mother, Mother, Gentlemen, and girls, together and upload the picture.
Today and tomorrow will be an opportunity to give Yoga a new level.
This film will be tomorrow's picture tomorrow, and it will be a pleasant tomorrow's promise.
I invite you all.
There's still about three weeks left to be world-class.
This is a sort of healthcare scheme.
I invite anyone to be part of it.
When you took up the responsibility of being an important servant, I got the opportunity to speak for the first time on 15th August at Red Fort in Delhi, I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been going to different parts of Hindustan.
What are some Modi doing Where is Modi going
I am grateful to him for seeing this.
If you hear this phone call, you'll understand.
Pranam Modiji, I'm talking to Naina from Mumbai.
Modiji, wherever you go, I see people paying special attention to cleanliness in TV and community offices.
Whether in Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
Not only the elderly, but also the children are awakened about cleanliness.
Children who blame people on the road are able to bury them everywhere.
A few days ago, I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
What is more joyful than cleanliness is linked to my journey
Welcoming the Prime Minister, the habit of preparing all the other preparations will be a big thing.
It makes everyone happy and inspires.
"When Modiji decides on his journey, ask those who ask him, wherever he invites me, what kind of cleanliness will be
How many tons of garbage will you dedicate to me let me see if I want to come or not.
The idea is very good, but I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, we have to become an entrepreneur to create so many square metals.
A lot of people can be saved from disease.
What a great humanitarian thing
Look wealthy and wealthy without counting these dustbins as dust.
It's not merely dirty.
If we start looking at these wastewaters as wealthy, then new methods of waste management will be brought before us.
Youth associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and will come up with new instruments.
With the cooperation of the State Governments, the Government of India is determined to launch a massive drive in the field of waste energy with the help of peoples representatives of cities.
On the occasion of World Environment Day on June 5, we are going to provide relevant storage available to about 4,000 cities of the country for collection of fertilizers and liquid material.
There are two kinds of charcoals, one green and the other blue.
The kitchen wastes, green leafy skins, food habits, eggs, leaves and liquids, must be put into green nests.
It is also beneficial in the field of agriculture that it is farming and it is remembered what is greenery .
The second unnecessary paper, metallurgy, glasses, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken dubbages, rubber items, etc. are all dried up in a way.
The entire responsibility is for the Warsaw Residents Volunteers.
Brothers and sisters, today I want to tell you something very happy that the Reasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become an open defecation free area in connection with the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I congratulate all the people of Reasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the last fifteen days, even in a month or in a TV channel or in social media, the present government has been calculating.
Three years ago, you were responsible for my main servant.
A lot of people walked, a lot of consultations took place.
I see all this in a very healthy way.
This three-year activity has been changed in every way.
People from all walks of life have hungry about it.
This is a very good way of democracy.
Governments must be responsible for democracy, people should be given accounts of their actions by the government.
I thank those who have given a different, noble opinion.
Proactive criticism strengthens democracy.
This hurricanes are very important for the awakened nation and an elegant nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you, and as a common citizen, I feel the impact and influence of good and bad people as a citizen.
As I said, as an ordinary citizen, I have an impact on my mind, that is important.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Hon'ble President, Hon'ble Vice President, Hon'ble Vice President, Hon'ble Speaker Mahodaya, along with a study book on Mann Ki Baat, was published as an individual and a very enthusiastic citizen.
He was grateful to the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of the House, for giving him the importance of Mann Ki Baat in a time bound manner.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given a new dimension.
Some friends also interacted with me during the work of book on Manki Baat.
He said that he would like to prepare a sketch for all the issues he has spoken in the Mann Ki Baat, and artistic to Akbar Saheb Mann Ki Baat to express his affection without paying a rupee.
I am grateful to Akbar.
My dear countrymen, by next time Mann Ki Baat will be announced, the entire country will be raining, the weather will change, the results of the examinations will start, the new teachings will begin... when the rain comes, a new heat and fragrance will spread.
We can move forward by expressing our love for nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, addressed the gathering on the occasion of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the 3rd April, 2017, at 11 a.m.
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
The curiosity of the children, the great aspirations of the youth, the experiences of the elderly...
Normally, it's people's nature to advise others.
On the train, if anyone coughs while going to the bus, he's just saying, do it, do it.
Advice, suggestion is in our nature.
In the first instance, when suggestions were received about Mann Ki Baat, he heard the voice of advice and learned something.
But when we tried to absorb it smoothly, it was really absorbed.
They actually do something more than those who say these words and those who try to come to me.
They pursue their intellect, strength and efficiency in order to do a good job.
When I noticed this, I thought these suggestions were unusual.
Last time, I had regretted the waste of food in Mann Ki Baat.
This is an example of how things are happening with the cooperation of society.
Today is the end of April, the last day.
May 1 is the foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Nature has changed all the rules of the game.
The warmth of May-June in our country had to be felt in March this year.
Many of them have expressed their views on what to do during this summer while accepting aspirations from people for Mann Ki Baat.
Everything is prevalent, not new, but it is very useful to repeat it at the right time.
Many friends starting cartilage are worried about birds.
They said they wanted to keep water in balcony and terrace.
Small kids in the family are very excited about this.
If they've ever noticed why they have to keep water, they'll go ten times a day to check if they have water.
The birds will notice if they come.
We feel that this is a game, but in reality, it is a good experience for the children to awaken the ghost.
He lived up to 103 years.
In his 100th Birth Anniversary, Bohra Samajam Burhani Foundation has undertaken a massive drive to save pigs.
I got the opportunity to start it.
They distributed approximately fifty thousand sweets to the world.
It was found in the Ginnace Book of World Records.
Sometimes the paper giver, the milkman, the vegetables, the postman, etc. , forget to ask whether we want water for summer or not.
Young friends, I want to tell you something.
Many of our young generations are happy to live in a very comfortable condition.
Mothers and mothers grow them safely.
But I would like to tell you as a friend how your vacation should be.
New places, new experiences, new skills...
Sometimes watching things on TV, or reading in books, or listening to acquaintances... and feeling the same...
Experiments may be social, let's get out of luxury.
We are from a middle-class family to a happy family.
You can never see the joy of playing in life before.
Have you ever thought that when the children who lead such a life in the society get a chance to play with you, how much change will be in their lives
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Go to the forest.
Perhaps summer sets will be organised, individual development sculptures...
There will be several developmental issues.
Everyone will be busy with technology in their world.
Social life is a culture, it's a power.
Another thing I said about skills, and you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competition.
There will be a lot of hard work to buy higher markets and any coaching will go to the class during the holidays and the next examination will be concerned.
But keep in mind whether the inner humanity is incapable of being away from human qualities.
Can we focus a little more on skill development
I want you to get out of technology and spend some time with you.
Learn some musical instrument, learn 5-50 words of a new language, either Tamil or Telugu or Assamese, Bengali or Malayalam, Gujarati or Marathi or Punjabi.
Try to learn something you don't know, you'll have some benefit.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, see it like a curiosity, understand, discuss with people, ask them... and give them a different pleasure to see it.
Try and fix the place yourself.
Don't lose time for travel.
Go to a place and spend three to four days there.
Then go somewhere else and stay there for three to four days.
It can learn a lot of things.
Share me the pictures where you're going.
Share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has given you a good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from patterns.
They don't need formats.
They're starting to believe in digital transactions.
Do you think you can do this and earn money
The Government of India has a plan.
You must have downloaded the Bhima up.
Ten rupees from the government will be deposited in your account.
One day, if you join twenty people, you can earn 200 rupees by late.
Businessmen and students can earn through this.
The project is scheduled till October 14th.
You have played an important role in making Digital India.
You'll be a guardian of New India.
Holidays, Holidays, Holidays, Holidays.
Get introducing the digital.
Normally in our country there is an atmosphere of hatred for VIP culture.
However, now I have come to know that the government has decided that no matter how big the country is, however, the red light will not be rotated in the vehicle.
It became a sign of VIP culture in a way.
It is understood from the experience that even though the red light is on the vehicle, it will enter the minds of the people and become brilliantly VIP culture.
Now the red light is gone, so nobody can claim that the red light is gone in the head.
I got a very interesting phone call.
People are worried on the red light.
Government wants to talk about prohibition of red beacon lights.
I read in the paper, every Indian is a VIP on the line.
I felt very proud of it.
Thank you for that.
When it is called EPI instead of VIP, it means that every Person is embroidery is important for everyone.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to remember our history, our culture and our traditions again.
This will give us energy and inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Ramnujacharya, the 150 crore Indians.
We've been involved in other things to remember only those centuries.
Shatabdi may be very important for other countries of the world.
Self and behaviour changed those who didn't belong to society.
Thousands of years ago, he organised a campaign to enter the temple and successfully visited the temple.
How lucky we are to be born in our society to ignore the evils of our society in all ages
When we celebrate the birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we will inspire the spirit of strength in organising social unity.
To revive the memory of Swami Ramanujacharya, the Union Government is launching a stamp tomorrow on 1st May.
Swami Ramanujacharya is respected and dedicated to the nation.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is another important one.
A few people must be aware that today we are obliged to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect of the workers.
Baba Saheb's contributions to the welfare of the workers are unmistakable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb and Ramnujacharya, the great Karnataka Sanyasi of the 12th century reminds us of Jagat Guru Basaveshwar.
Yesterday I got a chance to attend a function.
I got the opportunity to release his verses.
In the twelfth century, he is deeply concerned about teaching and teaching.
In the language of the wood, he said, Caia Cailas.
This means that you can reach Lord Shiva's elegance through adhwana.
I mean, heaven can be achieved by working...
I often say that I've won an effort.
I often remember that Dattapant Thangdiji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Mussoorie group, has said about the importance of labour.
Today, it is natural to remember Dattapant Thangdi when talking about the workers.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate the Buddha Purnima.
People from all over the world will celebrate that.
Ashoka's life in India is an excellent example of his journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that the United Nations is celebrating Vesak Day on this great mountain of Buddha Purnima.
This is happening in Sri Lanka this time.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have the opportunity to honour Buddha in Sri Lanka.
He will get a chance to renew his memories.
My dear countrymen, efforts have been made to move forward in India with the mantra of SabkaSaathSabkaVikas (SabkaVikas with everyone and everyone).
Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas is not only in India but also in the global context.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
India will be launching South Asia Satellite on May 5.
The capability and connectivity of this satellite will help in fulfilling South Asias economic and developing priorities.
This will help in the preparation of the framework of the natural resources, whether in terms of tele-medicine or in the field of education, whether in terms of connectivity of more depth technology or in terms of people-to-people contacts.
This is a great step towards enhancing cooperation with the entire South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day.
A historic struggle against injustice and a remarkable victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day.
The memories of Rabindranath Tagore are traditional to us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore has also written the National Anthem of Bangladesh.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but also gave him the status of the British Nighthood.
However, Rabindranath Tagore is one of the great men who had campaigned in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919.
That was a child who was only 12 years old who was deeply impressed.
The boy who laughed at the fields and playgrounds during his childhood made a new inspiration for the brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh.
In 1919, the 12-year-old boy, Bhagat is the inspiration of all of us and of all of us, Shahid Bhagat Singh.
On 23rd March, the British hanged Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We know that even at the time of death, there was no joy in serving Bharatmaba in the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life have been dedicated to the freedom of India.
These three heroes continue to inspire us even today.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
They were afraid of the British Empire.
But the British had the idea of what was in their case.
That's why 23 people were killed for hanging on March 24.
They did it without anybody knowing extraordinary.
Then they brought their body to Punjab today and fired them without any knowledge.
When I got the opportunity to go there for the first time a few years ago, I felt a special vision on that planet.
Of course, I would like to tell the youth of the country that if you get a chance, you must go to Punjab, then you must go to the pilgrimages of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Badukeshwar Dath.
Freedom struggle, its intensity and its propaganda were increasing.
On one hand heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the Armed Forces revolution.
In Champaran, the vision of Gandhiji's thinking and his style was visible in the freedom struggle of India.
In 1915 Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and made a new inspiration for the country.
Today, we cannot calculate the Satyagraha of Champaran on the basis of what form of Mahatma Gandhi has in our mind.
A man who came back to Hindustan in 1915... spent just two years...
It was just a beginning.
Let's assume how hard he has to suffer at that time, how hard he has to work.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to identify Mahatma Gandhi's organisation and the ability to popularize the country.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour, organised, motivated and fought the poor and illiterate people in front of the British Empire...
Champaran Satyagraha shows us this wonderful power, so that we can recognise the emergence of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think about Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago then Champaran Satyagraha is a big study for any person starting a public life.
This is the strong foundation of a New India.
New India is not a government concept, it is not a demonstration of any democratic party.
The New India is the call of about 150 crore people.
It is a vision to build a grand India by gathering around 150 crore people.
There is an idea, enthusiasm, imagination and aspiration among the 1. 5 billion people.
Like silent servants, they're doing it as a thirsty thing.
There are many people who go to regular hospitals to help the patients.
As soon as he knows, there are many who run for blood donation.
If someone's hungry, there's a lot of people who think of feeding them.
We can say that our country is a great saint.
The imagination of Lord Jesus Christ is in our veins.
If we look at it with societal sensitivity, then how power will it be
When we talk about New India, we should think about it, analyze it and look at it through a different approach.
If 1. 25 billion people decide the path with determination, one step after the other, the dream of a hundred and fifty crore people of New India will come true in our eyes.
Government cannot afford it through budget, through government schemes.
If we decide that the transportation laws will be observed by all citizens, if all citizens decide that they will fulfil my obligations, they will not use petrol or diesel one day a week...
You can see this dream of New India directly in this country with a hundred and fifty crore people.
It means that all citizens should keep their citizenship and maintain their duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, people in our country have been participating in a digital revolution called Digital Payments, which is curious about how money can be disbursed without money.
Even the poorest of the poor are trying to learn it, and gradually the people are moving towards making transactions without any currency.
There have been several ways of digital payments after the note-taking programme.
It's been only two and a half months since the Bhima App, but now 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
Hundreds of millions of people don't wait for a year if they want.
It's only six months to do.
We can do this in everyday life.
This is a great service that you cannot imagine for the country and you will be the heroine of the fight against corruption and corruption.
Several digital fairs have been organized to teach this to the people and to make people aware.
100 programmes will be organized across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
There were also presentations.
Twelve lakh people have received gifts for consumers.
Seventy thousand people received gifts for traders.
Everyone is determined to go ahead with this approach.
14th April, 2018
As soon as it was decided, on 14th April, this Digital Festival will be concluded on the occasion of birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb.
A grand programme is being organized on completion of 100 days.
There's arrangement for mega burying.
We can inspire the BHIM App in the days to come to Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Make ourselves a part of reducing the sums of money lending.
Dear Countrymen, I am glad that every time Mann Ki Baat has a lot of opinion from the people, but the need for cleanliness is always rising.
My best wishes to you all for the first time in your victory in this election.
I want to tell you my Manki Baat.
I want to tell people how important cleanliness is.
I'm going through a river every day, in which people put a lot of rubbles and pollute the river.
Brothers and sisters, look at the pain that a child studying in the eleventh grade gets polluted.
The child gets so angry at the squares in the river.
It's a good symptom.
There has been a new rise in the country since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Hate to waste is increasing.
Would you wake up, be it an active partnership, a people's race... it's important.
I want to tell all those who listen to Gayatri in my Manki Baat today that the message of Gayatri should be a message to all of us.
The things they see are filled in the plate, they can't eat.
Nobody's supposed to tell this.
Children in our homes when they supplicate their mothers, sons or daughters, take them everywhere.
Secondly, it is economically beneficial for the family if it can save a little from it.
It's good to think for the society, but it's profitable for the family.
I don't insist on this, but I urge you to wake up.
I know the youngsters who do great things in this regard.
They've made a mobile app for them.
When people know that there is such sweet food somewhere, people call it and use it properly.
Young people in our country are doing this meditation.
We can see people like this in every state of Hindustan.
Maybe we can inspire them not to swallow their lives.
Eat as much as you can.
Look, this is the way of change.
Those who are cautious about health always say - keep a little empty stomach and keep the plate on foot.
When you talk about health, remember April 7, the World Health Day.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has set a target of health for all by 2030.
This time, the United Nations focuses on Depression on World Health Day, April 7.
We also know the word 'depression', but if the word means, some people call it depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are under depression.
Creating a psychological atmosphere starts to free.
The first mantra is to say it openly rather than to curtail depression.
Tell your friends, parents, brothers, teachers.
Sometimes loneliness, especially the children in the hostel, will have more trouble.
Our country's culture is that we are living together and growing together... the larger family, the intermediaries, thereby reducing the risk of depression.
Otherwise, all of you don't come out together. I don't want to be alone.
Let those who can speak openly to him have a chance to stay with him.
Smile and try to talk to him, bring him out if he's sorry.
It's a good way.
Depression causes physical and mental illness.
As diabetes becomes the master of all kinds of diseases, depression is absent from all the ability to fight, dare and decide.
If you are unable to open your minds before your own people then seek help from someone who is very serving.
Help me, share your happiness.
If you try to understand the grief of someone else, you will have a new self-confidence within you.
If you are connected to others, you can also reduce the burden of your mind if you are serving someone with selflessness.
Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in emancipation of tension, freedom from mental stress, efforts towards cleanliness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Last day, the central government had taken a major decision.
The number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and it should be welcomed that their share is increasing.
The responsibility of the family has to be shared in the economic responsibilities of the household, and this has to lead to injustice to the newborn.
Therefore, the central government has taken a big decision.
India has taken such a big decision for our sisters.
Dear Countrymen, Ram Navami is on 5th April and on 9th April, Mahavir Jayanti is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of these great men be inspired, let us have the power to swear for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shuklaprakash, Year Eve, New Year Festival, many festivals to all of you in this new year.
This is the beginning of farming after spring, which is the time for farmers to get their results.
This New Year is celebrated in many ways in different parts of our country.
It is a new year to celebrate the New Year in the name of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Andhra and Karnataka as a New Year, Sindhi-Chand for Sindhis, Navareh in Kashmir, Samvatsarpuja in the Awadh region, Jud-Seetal in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani in Magadha.
India is such a diverse country.
My best wishes to you all in this New Year.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, addressed the gathering on the occasion of the launch of the special launch of the Akashvani to the people of India at 11:00 a.m.
New leaves have started coming to the trees after the dawn.
The flowers bloom.
Gardens and gardens are green.
Birds begin to attract their minds.
Not only the flowers, but also the shining fruits in the tree branches.
As a result of the summer, the flowers of Manga begin to appear in spring.
Amir Khusro has very interestingly spoken about the moments that are changing.
Amir Khusro writes: When Fool Rahee Sarasom Sakal Bun, Ambaa Phoode, Tesu Foulecoil Boley, Dar-Dar (foods, flowers, flowers, flowers etc.) are naturally enjoyed, the money becomes comfortable, the humans enjoy it.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri, Holi celebrations are a celebration of happiness in human life.
Various people don't know about the achievements of ISRO.
So they say they want to provide information about the launch of 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Bhubaneswar thanked him very much for reminding him of India's proud achievement.
Technology and science have marked its role in combating poverty, prevention of diseases, connectivity with the world, or in acquiring knowledge.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have created an opportunity to raise India's heritage in front of the world.
We all know that many unprecedented missions have been successfully completed in the last few years.
After the victory of Mangalyaan on Mars, a world record has been established on the same day.
104 satellites of different countries including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and India have been successfully launched through the ISRO Mega Industries.
Together, India has become the first country in the world to draw 104 satellites into the atmosphere.
It is a matter of great happiness that the PSLV will be successfully launched for the 38th time.
This is not only the ISRO but also the history of India.
The ISROs cost-effective and efficient environment mission is astonishing all over the world.
The world appreciates the success of Indian scientists with an open mind.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 categories is the greatest.
I've sent some pictures as soon as our satellite arrives.
It's starting its job.
It is a matter of great happiness that our young scientists and women scientists led the entire mission.
Such a role of youth and women is an important component of the success of the ISRO.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO for the people of the country.
They have always shown their goal of bringing an ecosystem for the common man and for the service of the nation, and they are placing new slaves in their crown as daily.
India has successfully tested the ballistic interceptor missile in the security sector.
You will be happy to know that at least four or five countries of the world can achieve this.
Scientists of India showcased this.
Its achievement is that even if the missile coming from India is 2,000 kilometers away, it can be destroyed within the missile space itself.
When we see new technologies, we feel happy to see new sciences.
In the development journey of mankind, curiosity has played a very important role.
Brahminda, creations, human minds are constantly trying to know.
New science and new technologies are born from it.
All the technologies and all the new forms of science give birth to a new era.
My dear youngsters, we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, and often I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should enhance their aspirations towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today's scientists become the cause of a new change in the life of future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, "A science has not exploded from the sky in a perfect way.
All sciences are developed and built on experiences.
"I express my heartfelt condolences to the enthusiasm, teaching and dedication that led them in the investigation of the modern scientists following the truth.
"Scientific research is aimed at utilizing the principles for the needs of the common people, how its media should be, what technology should be, because it is considered to be the greatest contribution of the common man.
Identifying, displaying such inventions, providing information to the people, how such inventions benefit the common man, how much production can be, how it can be commercially used.
Sometimes problems show the importance of science in finding peace.
All arrangements are being made in accordance with technology.
In a way, technology becomes an incredible part of our lives.
In the last few days, the Digi-Dhan Yojana was very important.
Especially the youngsters are habituated to digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see it as a good pleasure.
During the last few days in our country, we had great support for the 'Lakey Grahak Yojana' and 'DG Dhan Business Yojana'.
For nearly two months, 10,000 people get a thousand rupees a day.
Through these two projects, the country has got the opportunity to make digital payments a mass movement in India.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh subscribers have been awarded each lakh rupees.
More than 4000 traders received an award of Rs.
The farmers, traders, small businessmen, and other professionals, housewives and students are enthusiastic about this.
When asked if only young people come or older, the awardees have 15-year-old youth and 65-70 year olds.
My dear brothers and sisters of Mysore, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has been awarded a thousand rupees under the 'Lakey Grahak Yojana'.
So I thought they deserved me a thousand rupees, and I gave them that thousand rupees.
I am very happy that your name and your work will give us all the happiness.
All of you have done inspiring work.
In Maharashtra, a young friend, Pooja Nemade is a postgraduate student, who shared his experiences with others about how they use Rupay Card e-wallet in their family, how happy they are to use it.
On completion of 100 days of Lakhi Grahak Yojana, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birthright.
On 14th April, a huge prize worth crores will be held.
Forty-five days remain.
Remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can you not do this thing
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary is over.
Recalling him, you should also teach at least 125 people to download the BHIMAP.
Teach us how the monetary activity is going on, especially the neighbours.
This time, Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti should be given special importance to Bhim App.
Go home and bring them all together to 125 crore hands to Bhima App.
This movement, which has been going on for the past two-three months, has been successful in many townships, in many villages and in many cities.
Farmers in our country have produced food grains this year to mitigate the records.
All indications are that our farmers have broken the records of the past.
It seemed to be a day-to-day celebration of Pongal and Vaishakhi after seeing the crops in the fields.
This year, more than two thousand 70 lakh tonnes of foodgrains were produced in the country.
The farmers of my country have heard the voices of the poor and about 290 lakh hectares of farmland have been cultivating different types of plants.
The government is constantly trying.
Last day, a programme of senior officers from 23 States under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India was organised in Telangana.
We can see wealth from dirt.
It's proven.
If a six-party family has a standard double kitchen toilet, it will be filled in about six years.
After that the dirt can be returned to the second hole.
In six to twelve months the dust in the ditch is totally burnt.
It's completely safe to handle such a filthy dirt, as a curve, a very important giant NPK.
Farmers know the curtains of NPK.
Nitrogen, phosphorus and potatosis are very nutritious and it is considered to be a very good growth in the agriculture sector.
As the government takes this step, others must have taken such steps.
Several departments are regularly conducting Swachhta Hills at the government level.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development is going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan in collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Child Development in the first phase of March.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR), Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR), Government of India has taken forward the Swachh Bharat Mission.
We all know that whatever citizen of our country does well, the country will be proud of a new spirit.
I once again congratulate all the players in the team.
The country is proud of the achievements of our divyang friends.
I have always thought that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable and determined, brave and imaginative.
We get to learn something from them in the next minute.
Whether it is a matter of sports or environment, women in our country are not far behind.
Together, we are moving forward, we are making the countrys name bright by achieving achievements.
In the past few days, our women have silver medals in the Asian Rigbby Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to the players.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on March 8.
Today it's not just a government program.
People's thinking has changed over the years of old customs.
It's a pleasure to hear the news of the girl's birth being turned into celebration.
In a way, positive thinking to girls has become a cause for social recognition.
It was informed that in the district of Gudalur in Tamil Nadu, child marriages have been stopped through a special public movement.
So far, about 175 children have been able to stop marriages.
Bank accounts have been opened for more than 50,000-2000 girls as per the district administration's SAUNAGYA Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Katwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all sections are covered under the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme and efforts are being made to organise rural households as well as to seize organic girls and ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organized to educate girls in every village and every household under the Gharghar Dastak Gram Sadak Yojana.
Rajasthan, our child, our school, Amina Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, has undertaken a scheme to re-school and motivate the students who have been educated.
The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme has been undertaking several forms.
I see it with a good sign.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country enjoys the rainy season, on the other hand, there are festivals and fairs in every corner of India.
It'll be like this till Diwali.
Perhaps our ancestors have ceased to create a concerted, economical and social life in a way that society is not lazy in any way.
In the last few days, we celebrated several festivals.
Everyone can find solutions to these problems from the life of Shri Krishna.
Despite all these significance, take charge of Sarathi in the battlefield.
Sometimes pick up the mountain, sometimes eating the leaves.
I mean, Krishna has a new feeling of everything.
So, when I talk to you today, I pay my attention to the two monks.
One Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohen and the other Mohen.
Mohnan, a Sudarshan Chakradhar, left the Yamuna and dwelt in the city of Dwarka on the seashore in Gujarat and reached Delhi on the banks of the Yamuna in the last days.
Whether it is the significance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna the importance of swimming beneath all the high standards of life.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new dimension has been established for mankind.
The spirit of service, service and duty towards service was always a part of his life, which was always associated with Mahatma Gandhi.
In his own lives, he put forward the example of service.
Mahatma Gandhi's personality, society, humanity - this was the best.
Whether it is at the Finnics Family in Africa or at the Tolstoy Family, he emphasized the importance of social harmony everywhere in his own way, whether at the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit several important places related to the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can tell you that Gandhi has given importance to organisation with the spirit of service.
We have to bring the feeling of social service, social growth and social organisation into our practical life.
In the true sense, this is Mahatma Gandhi's vision and realism.
There will be a lot of opportunities like this, and we will grow together.
But what is Gandhi 150
What should we think of sharing these efforts as a person
Think of what value is alone.
Ladies' club.
Let us continue to do things in the modern ladies club, but all the members of the Ladies club should work together.
I can do a lot of things.
Recognize old books, distribute them to the poor and give them information.
130 crore people will have 130 crore concepts and 130 crore initiatives can be launched.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
The salt festival that took place in Dandi during the freedom struggle was a great path.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I urge you to visit any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere - Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaranak, Wardha Ashram, and somewhere in Delhi.
When you go to a place like this, you must share your picture in the social media and inspire others.
This time, in the Indian Pavilion of Venice Benale, there was a very interesting exhibition on Gandhijis memories.
The Haripura panels were particularly attractive.
You must remember that the great congress of Gujarat was held in Haripura, Gujarat and the event that was chosen as the President of Subhas Chandra Bose.
These exhibitions have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura Conference of Congress, in 1937-38, the then Principal Nandalal Bose invited Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan to the art house.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people of India and showcase his artwork at the Mahasam festival.
With the constitution of his art, Nandalal Bose was also irrigated.
Nandalal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and finally painted a few pictures that showcase the lives of rural India.
These valuable art works have been discussed in Venice.
Once again, I wish to convey my best wishes to Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary and also to all Indians to make a resolve.
For the country, for the society, for anyone else.
This will be the best, realistic performance of Bapu.
Friends, Over the last few years, we have been running a programme on cleanliness for almost two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start on September 11.
This time, the plastic should be given special importance.
From Red Fort on 15th August, I had recalled how enthusiastic and enthusiastic people had organised a mass movement for waste management.
Similarly, we have to finish the use of single-use plastic together.
There is great enthusiasm for all sections of the society in this regard.
Many of my brothers and sisters from the business community have placed a board in front of the shop, writing that those who buy goods should bring bags.
With this, money can also be saved and they can play their role in protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we celebrated his 100th birth anniversary, we not only dedicate to him an India free from open defecation, but also lay the foundation stone for a new public meeting against plastic across the country.
I'll turn it into fuel.
What is greater inspiration than Gandhiji
My dear countrymen, our cultural texts are in a way wisdom.
We'll get what we want in our lives.
I would like to say a great deal through a cultured translation.
This is a matter written centuries ago, but is still very important today.
Very well-designed is the essence of the essence of the essence of the essence of the essence of the essence of the essence of the essence of the essence of the essence of the essence.
The foolish people call stone a jewel.
In our culture, Anna had great glory.
We have changed the knowledge of the day into science.
The need for nutrition is transforming the country into a mass movement through modern scientific methods.
People are fighting against nutrition through new and attractive methods.
According to this, in the days of harvesting, sevaks from the anganwadis are collecting grains from the people.
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women.
After this, the person is dedicated to this goal and becomes the fighter of the people.
All of us must have heard about an event called Annaprash in every part of India.
It's the first time it's used to feed the kids.
Not liquid, stinky food.
People are performing food grains everywhere.
When the family comes to life, bedrooms, memorable days, people of the family make nutritious, tasty food and take them to Anganwadi or to school, and those from their families call upon their children.
Sharing their happiness and sharing others.
It is a good combination of service and happiness.
Friends, there are many small things like this that can be successfully fought against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of information on nutrition, malnutrition and poor and rich suffer.
The month of September will be observed throughout the country for nutrition.
You must also be part of it, add something new, and let your share be in it.
It means that if you can save a person from malnutrition, we save ourselves from malnutrition.
Everything I've visited in the past weeks, man vs.
I have never thought that there will be a chance to touch the minds of youngsters around the world.
What's happening
He went to Bhutan last week.
Since I have had the opportunity to go anywhere since then, whenever I have the opportunity to sit with anyone because of the International Day of Yoga, someone else is asking me something about Yoga.
I don't have a big leader who doesn't discuss Yoga with me in the world, but this is my experience all over the world.
The Discovery Channel is scheduled to broadcast language in 165 countries.
I firmly believe that this episode of Discovery Channel will help in introducing the world about India's message, India's tradition and natural compassion for India's cultural journey.
Today people want to know about the steps taken for climate conservation and creative environment in our country.
Have you been shooting several times
I ask you very cleverly.
Look, there's no secret.
I'll tell you the secret because there's a question in the minds of many.
No secrets.
It is true that technology has been dedicated to the interaction with Bayer Grills.
Whatever I say, its translation was going on in English, and he was listening through a small instrument in the ears of Bear Grills.
I mean, he was listening to English while I spoke in Hindi, so it was easy to talk, this is a wonderful technologies.
After this show, many Jim Corbett spoke to me about the National Park.
You and nature must go to wildlife related places.
I have said this before and again I have to go north-east of India.
You have to spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, the concerns and concerns about the environment in India, that is, the thinking of protecting the nature is naturally visible.
Last month, I had the opportunity to release the country's Tiger Census.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
It's been half a year ago.
In 2010, a summit was held for tigers at St. Petersburg, Russia.
That day it was decided by expressing concern over the reduction in the number of tigers in the world.
It was decided to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a new India, we are aiming at a fast pace.
We doubled the number of tigers in 2019.
The number of tigers in India has not only doubled the number of protected areas and community reserves.
Gir took several steps in the jungle one after another.
In 2007, it was decided to appoint female guards.
Infrastructure has been increased to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and the wildlife, we talk about protection.
We must think of sympathy beyond protection.
In our sciences, there is very good advice on this.
Listen to what has been said in our sciences centuries ago, if there are no forests then the tigers are forced to come and die if there is no forest.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekanandan on September 11, 1893.
India's glorious personality has been established in the world by this young sanyasi who has captured the humanity of the whole world.
On September 11, 1893, the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda made the world obliged to change his vision towards India.
Come, let us try to live with the true strength of India, which Swami Vivekananda saw, the shape of India which Swami Vivekananda saw, and we have everything inside us.
But I don't enter the details.
Wait till August 29.
To get rid of plastic, we will strive at home and abroad with all our strength.
I am confident that this movement will be filled up in the social media.
Come, let us move forward with a new zeal, with a new determination.
We can move forward by making the inner happiness manifested with a sense of service.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at 11am on January 20, 2017.
My dear countrymen, blessings to everyone.
On our Republic Day, January 26, everyone celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
Our commitment to the Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens and democracy is a cultural festival which warns and cultures the coming generation with democracy and democratic responsibilities.
However, the depth and the widespread discussion of the citizens' duties and the rights of the citizens in our country is not that much.
In both cases, social perspective, determination and respect for the martyrs are evident.
Everyone has a natural respect for the army and security personnel in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the heroes and their families, honoured by various brave architects.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Would you like to do something specially for me to appeal to the youngsters, to intervene very enthusiastically in social media
On the one hand, when we were happy to hear the celebrations of 26th January with joy and enthusiasm, the brave soldiers of our army who were guarding for the security of the country in Kashmir were brave news.
I pay homage to the heroes and bow down to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I am constantly clearing my mind through Mann Ki Baat programme.
The months of January, February, March and April are the days of examinations in every family.
When I came to know about this issue, many teachers, parents, students messed me up, asked me questions, suggested, pained, painful and difficult.
I would like to share my thoughts with you after seeing all that.
I've got the phone message of a child called Creation.
Listen, the creation says: "Sir, I want to tell you that there is a very scary atmosphere in our home, in our neighbourhood and society at the time of examination.
That's why children get encouragement rather than encouraging them.
Those who are happy for the exams are very few.
Exam for more and more people is an opportunity for pressure.
That's when there's good in us, that's coming out.
There is a feeling of strength in the society's festival.
The best is revealed.
During the exams, a procession should be created between friends and neighbourhoods.
You'll see the pressure turning into a placer, and the pressure becomes happy.
Prosperity makes the mind weightless.
Look, it'll change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup to Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three examinations are conducted in these four months.
You must understand that the power to call memories is calm.
If you're in tension, all the doors are closed, the outside will not come in, the inside will not come out.
There is an obstacle in the thought process, which becomes a burden.
I'm telling you from my experience, if there is a mental pressure, then we forget, if there is peace, we can remember things that we cannot imagine, which will be very useful.
The problem is that you don't know, it's not that you didn't study.
But when you are stressed, your wisdom, knowledge and learning are pressed, your mental pressure is curtailing all this.
Life seems to be a problem.
I think your exam will be an exam for the study done throughout the year.
P.
J.
If he had been disappointed because of that failure, if he had failed with his life, if India had been able to get such a great scientist, would he have been able to get such a great President
Therefore, the competition has grown, and psychological pressure has also increased among students.
Marks and mark sheets have very limited use.
It's not in life.
Life is dependent on how much knowledge you have acquired.
If you believe in these things, Mark Walk will follow you, you will never need to follow the mark.
You can benefit from knowledge, skills, self-confidence and decisiveness in your lives.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
So Mark's weight stops us from going the right path.
But if you pay attention to the market, you will gradually limit you to certain things, just to get rid of it.
This is a very psychological battle.
Indeed, the competition is not useful to lead life and it is necessary to compete with oneself to move forward in life.
How can the day be better than last day
How is the chance to come better than what happened
Often you've seen it in the games, and you'll understand it quickly, so I'll tell you the example.
It is the specialty of their lives that they compete for themselves in terms of more victorious games.
You didn't sleep because of the stress of the exams before, did you sleep now
Secondly, you're worse than him.
Third, equal.
Just keep in mind how to do better than what you did earlier.
An opinion has been made about the role of beautiful parents.
He said the role of parents is very important in terms of exams.
Because mothers are more vigilant about the future of children at home, they are simplifying their actions.
If you learn to accept it, more problems will end there.
So I want to tell the parents that you do this to the children sometimes.
Did you feel that in the days of the exam, the children should be given the test of laughter
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very interesting phone call came.
Because I did something like that in my childhood, and I tried to fool my childhood once.
I've done a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find the way, so I lost a lot of time.
"You're right.
Sometimes when you don't trust yourself, you can check if I've written it right.
Perhaps it's true we wrote, it's wrong to write the next one.
It's gonna make ourselves wrong and lose ourselves.
I mean, the copies don't work much.
It's kind of a liar, so don't.
The coffee makes you bad, so don't shit.
"What is my Prime Minister asking the children to play at the time of exams"
It is generally understood that students are careful about learning from sports.
This idea is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If there is a comprehensive development, there is a life outside the books, and it is very wide.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to make life.
That's what it's called maintenance.
In my view of the examination, three things are important, the right rest, the second sleep for the body, and the third intellectual activity, and the body has a large part.
So the rest of the body needs a chance to work.
Have you ever thought of seeing the sky, seeing trees and plants, making your mind happy
Long breathing is very disturbing.
We don't have to be in the room to take long breaths.
Some think it's late in the night, more learning - that's not right.
You must sleep as much as you can.
So you won't lose time to learn.
A folk patron who came to see me about it asked, "How many hours do you sleep"
I asked him back, brother, are you a doctor
He said that while speaking at the time of election, your loud voice is related to sleep.
If you're sleeping enough, you'll get enough rest for your vocal code.
He gave me a big medicine that I didn't think of sleeping, vokel code and my voice.
It doesn't mean to sleep.
So don't do that.
If you can do it, don't do it...
Or it'll be a burden, and I'll join you to advise the parents of your family not to be heavy.
Remembering your own goals, trust yourself and go to your exams.
My best wishes.
Festival of exams to win all exams.
And the exam won't be tested.
Go ahead with this spell.
Dear Countrymen, Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on February 1, 2017.
On this occasion, I thank all the Coast Guard officials and the Jawans for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard is the 4th largest coastal force in the world, with 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in our country.
The Coast Guard has remained in an unprecedented environment to protect the maritime and maritime environment of the country by ensuring this spirituality.
Last year, the Coast Guards have taken a major step to clean the seashore of our country with their responsibility.
Thousands of people participated in it.
It is surely admirable that they thought of ocean cleanliness with coastal security.
It may be very few people know that not only men in our country's Coast Guard, but women also successfully carry out responsibility with their shoulders.
Our women officer in the Coast Guard, Pilot A and Observers, is not only working but also controlling the Hovercraft.
The maritime security today is a very important issue for the world, and I convey my best wishes to those who have worked as the maritime security of India on the fourth anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard.
It is a spring festival on 1st February.
Spring has been accepted as the best tub.
Spring is known as the king of sums.
In our country, the festival of Vasant Panchami Saraswati is celebrated.
It is considered as an opportunity to worship tricks.
Not only this, the heroes get inspiration.
Mera Range de Basanti Chola is an inspiration.
My countrymen have thousands of good wishes on this auspicious occasion.
My dear countrymen, the skies of Mann Ki Baat are giving new shapes in their own way.
Since last month, my Mann Ki Baat has started listening to Mann Ki Baat in local languages.
I once again congratulate Akashwani for their inspiration.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Hundreds of good wishes.
Today, there is a great opportunity for service, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Jesus Christ said, "The poor don't have our benefits, we need our approval."
St. Luke specially says, "Jesus has not only served the poor but also congratulated the poorest of the poor, this is the real empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave a lot, but the widow gave them everything, and today 25th December.
Two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Banaras, the peninsula of Malaviaji.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohana Malviya Cancer Care Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre built there will not only benefit the people of eastern Uttar Pradesh but also the people of Jharkhand Bihar.
Today, our former Prime Minister is the birth anniversary of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contributions of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have raised the strength of the nation.
As a party leader, as a Lok Sabha member, as a minister and as a Prime Minister, Atal ji had established a grand philosophy.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray to God for his health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Several memories are showing their eyes.
I have shared an old video this morning when I played the role of Atal ji as a small actor and I know how I had the privilege of enjoying the year of love.
Today, in Christmas tomorrow, the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes as a Christmas gift.
In a way, this project was started on November 2nd.
There is an atmosphere of excitement all around the country, whether it is village or city, whether it is educated or illiterate, whether it is cashless, how to do cashless payments, how to buy things without money.
Everyone wants to learn and know each other.
To encourage this, the Government of India is launching incentive schemes for consumers and small businessmen to strengthen mobile banking and become e-payment habits.
This is not only for one day but it will continue for 100 days from today.
Every day 10,000 people receive a thousand rupees.
You are deserving to be a gift of crores of rupees to millions of families in hundreds of days, without using digital payment methods like mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI and USD.
The Digi-Dhan Business Yojana is primarily meant for the traders.
This scheme has been designed for every section of the society, particularly for the poor and the lower middle class.
Therefore, those who purchase more than Rs. 50 and less than Rs. 3000 will receive this gift.
Those who buy goods worth more than Rs.
Feature phones can be used by the SSD for the poorest of the poor, ordinarily by phone, by selling goods, by paying money, so they can be the beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people can soon be part of the prize scheme.
If you ask them that the next youngsters will know these things, then they will tell them everything, and there will be children studying in your family, 10 or 12, and they will tell them very well.
It's simple as you send the Watts up messages on mobile phones.
My dear countrymen, how to use technology, how to do e-payment and how the online payment is being expanded rapidly in the country.
In the last few days, cashless business has increased by 200-300 times.
Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage this.
The business community can very well guess how big this decision is.
When digital delivery businessmen promote online payment methods instead of notes in their businesses, income tax will be reduced.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
Someone said that the government had decided to give 10 percent discount if the licence fees were discontinued digitally.
The branches of rural banks earn at least Rs. 50,000 from the government if they make two digital transactions between January and March by their 75 percent dealers.
On 31st March, 2017, 100 Digital Transaction villages have been announced to be given a grant of Rs. 5 lakhs as per the Good Pension for Digital Transaction Scheme.
They also announced a Digital Kisan Shiromani Yojana for the farmers, which will provide Rs.
In this regard, I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate all the governments on the initiatives like this.
Several organisations have undertaken several successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
He said that in a few days, about 5 lakh cheques of fertilizers and chemical limited farmers have been set up by thousands of POS machines for the convenience of the farmers of GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited.
The most interesting thing is that in comparison to last year, GNFC's turnover has increased by 27 percent.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youth have made great progress in the start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technologies, with new schemes, our youth must give importance to this sector.
So, we can become partners by taking full strength in the campaign to free the country from corruption and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I ask the people first in Manki Baat every month to share your opinions and tell you what to say.
MyGov and the Narendra Modi App this time, in thousands of opinions, about 80-90 percent of the fight against corruption and corruption were about to be withdrawn.
Some people have detailed information about the difficulties and inequalities faced by the people.
Another companion wrote that such a good thing is for the good of the country, however sacred things have been done, however, all the ways of trustworthy lies are found.
I am grateful to the people for writing so many letters and helping me.
The emotion of Guru Mani Kawal is the emotional expression in every corner of the country.
We can recognize it.
When people suffer, who are those who don't feel pain when they suffer
I feel the same pain as you do.
I clearly know that the blessings of the people are the blessings of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I thank the people, I bow to the people in this great order against corruption and corruption.
The law is the same to all.
Whether it is an individual or an organisation or a political party, everybody has to follow the law.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and black money have been trying their best to find out the shortcomings of the government.
This government is for the common people.
Continuously trying to find out the opinions of the people.
What is the problem for the people, what is the reason for the law, what is the solution
As an ever-sensitive government, how many laws are required to be changed in view of the comfort of the people, the aim is to reduce the suffering of the people.
On the other hand, I had already said that this was an extraordinary fight.
For 70 years, there has been a mix of all the strengths in the dealings of trust and corruption.
How much is their strength
When they are determined to fight such people, they are launching new methods every day to defeat the government.
When they adopt new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
You're the one that I'll ten - because it's decided that corrupt people, cheating mercenaries, will fail to commit suicide.
On the other hand, all kinds of liars have been found from many other letters to find new ways.
In this regard, I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to my dear countrymen.
The more the information is available in the government system, the more the information is available from the common people.
This is because the common people are awake.
Can anyone imagine how dangerous the cautious people of my country are challenging to bring these evil forces to light
They say, "Modiji, don't be weak, don't stand, don't stand, don't be too hard, don't want to reach the target if it's left.
I want to express my gratitude to those who wrote this letter because they have faith and blessings in their letters.
I took it out and made a strong Benami property law.
In the coming days, the law will start working on it.
For the country, whatever you want to do for the birth, it will be pre-emptive.
My dear countrymen, I had said this last time in Mann Ki Baat that our farmers had broken the record last year in terms of farming.
It's a good luck for agriculture.
In the last few days, India has been proudly renowned in many fields in the world economy, and as a result of the continuous evolution of our people, India's high vision in global rankings through different indicators.
Indias rank has risen in the World Banks Doing Business Report.
As per the Global Investment Report released by Dutch, India ranked third in the Top Prospective Host Economies for 2016-18.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have moved 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and 19 ranks in the Logistics Performance Index 2016 of the World Bank.
India is progressing at a rapid pace even if we assess several other reports.
But in this situation some good things are happening sometimes, the mind gets very happy.
The government is committed to the divine people.
I personally tried to speed up this move.
My aim was to get the rights and dignity of the Divyangjans.
Our divine brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and trust when we have achieved four medals in the Paralympics.
They not only raised the pride of the country but also surprised their talented people.
Our divine brothers and sisters, like all the citizens of the country, are our valuable wealth and strength.
I am very happy that this law will enhance the employment opportunities for Divyangjan after passing through this law for the good of the people of Divyang.
Government has enhanced the coverage of works to 4.
Special departments have been constituted in this regard regarding education, other facilities and complaints of Divyangjan.
The government has been able to guess how much sensitivity has been provided to the Divyangjans by organizing four thousand three-wheelers in the last two years and by spending Rs. 352 crores, the Divyangjans have distributed equipment to 5000 brothers and sisters.
The government has passed a new law in accordance with the wishes of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyanggar was seven kinds.
My young friends
Over the past few weeks, news from sports was proud of us.
It is natural for us to feel proud as an Indian.
The Indian Christian team has made a four-pronged victory against the England.
Some of these young sportspersons were appreciative.
Test captain Anit Kohli gave good leadership along with good batting.
Indian cricket team offspring bouler R.
Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
Junior Hockey team wins World Cup after 15 years.
Congratulations to you on this achievement.
This achievement is a good pleasure for the Indian Hockey team.
Our women were surprised last month.
The women hockey team of India has also received the Asian Champions Trophy, and now a few days back, India's women hockey team won the venture medal in the 18 Asia Cup.
Congratulations to all the sportspersons of the Hockey teams.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
In the last month, we were celebrating Diwali.
Some wrote poetry, some painted, some drew cartoons, some made video.
That's how many houses were turned into military posts.
I'm surprised to see how imaginative and visually impressed I see these letters.
With your partnership, the book is ready with your imagination of the country's army and your vision for security.
A young man wrote to me, the Prime Minister, all the festivals like Holi and Deepawali will be held on the border.
Every minute, the security of the country remains confused.
But I'll be reminded of the house in celebrations.
But it didn't happen this time.
I didn't think it wasn't at home.
It was also a pleasure that we are celebrating Diwali with a hundred and fifty crore Indians.
When the nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases by 125 crores.
A few days ago, the villages of Jammu and Kashmir were also seen.
They were the people of the Conferencing of Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in Kashmir.
I got a chance to talk to them for a while.
However, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order, and the future of the children, had come to an end.
I am glad that the word that I have given to all those rural headlines from the Kashmir Valley has been fully fulfilled.
They went to the village and even made far away people aware.
About 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the examination when the board exam was conducted a few days ago.
So many children participated in the board exams that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and education for a bright future.
Addressing the nation at 8:00 p.m. on 8th November, he said that an important step has been taken to bring about changes in the country.
The more important it is, the more important it is to be implemented, I felt that there would be difficulties in our normal life.
I had said that it will take 50 days to come out of the impact of this decision and that much decision will be taken after 50 days.
500 and 1000 letters, such a large country, so many taxes and crores of papers, these decisions are being taken care of by the world and all the economists are apprehensive and evaluating it.
A hundred twenty five crore people of India are trying to overcome the difficulties.
There may be a question mark in front of the world.
It is an honour to the hundred twenty five crore people of India.
Our country will be transformed into gold.
You're the citizens here, you're the ones, and you're the ones who can possibly make this way to victory.
All the components of State Governments, State Governments, Local Local Bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bankers, more than half a lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are working with dedication.
Between a variety of psychological conflicts, they are very quiet and considered it as a patriotic officer and are working as an effort to make a significant change.
Starting in the morning, he works without knowing when the night is over.
In spite of all these difficulties, the officials of the bank and the post office are working.
When it comes to humanity, they see two fronts.
There was an accident in Khandwa
Suddenly there was a need for money
It was a matter of great pleasure that when a bank official noticed that he himself went to the adult's house and provided enough money for treatment.
Such numerous stories can be known every day through TV, media, newspapers and others.
We are trying to save ourselves by misleading the poor by tempting them to deposit their accounts or by doing something else.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said, Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
Madhya Pradesh is from Tarali village in Tarkali Thaluk of Harda district.
People will be encouraged by this, the cashless economy is very important for nation building.
I'm with the country.
It is heartening to note the withdrawal of letters of 500 and thousand.
You want to thank you with your heart because nobody thought you'd make such a big step when you said your father's day would be.
Following the letters of 500 and thousand, he taught corrupt and corrupt people a good lesson.
Every Indian cannot come a better day.
People from many countries of the world also learnt to talk about Chai Pe Charcha.
But I didn't know we'd be married to Chai Pe's discussion.
I know there was a marriage with Chai Pe Charcha in Surat on 17th November.
In Sura in Gujarat, a girl gave tea to her married people.
There was no celebration, no food programmes, because of the withdrawal of the papers, the money was slightly difficult.
People find the best ways in a misery.
People are finding their ways.
You see this change.
Large people with relationships, who don't want to ask them, they don't pay properly, their penalties will be too much.
All municipalities may have earned 50 percent.
But this time, on the 8th of this decision, everyone ran away to shut down their old papers.
In 47 cities, over 3,500 crore cases have been registered during the last year.
You'll be surprised and happy to hear this, and this week it's worth thirty thousand crores.
There will be many examples of this kind of direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, our villages and our farmers have strengthened the economy of this country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, all citizens are combined with difficulties.
Under the Mudra Yojana, there is considerable progress in providing loans to them.
Under the Mudra Yojana, lakhs of crores of rupees have been given to small traders like this because crores of people have been doing these small businesses and they are speeding up the business of crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to be distressed by this decision.
However, now our small traders use technology, mobile app, mobile banking, their own way through credit card, and their consumers are being served on the basis of trust.
I would like to tell this small businessman that you too have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
You also download the bank applications on mobile phones.
You also have a POS machine to use a credit card.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that the entire business of your village will be able to bring this technology in place.
Don't let anyone blame you.
You, the youngest of my country, I know you liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know that you are very much involved in taking this forward in a very useful manner.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, my good friends.
This is a wonderful opportunity for us to serve Mother India and take the country to economic excellence.
My young men, can you help me
Perhaps your family doesn't know about elders, parents, parents, uncle and mother.
You know what the app is, online banking knows how online ticket booking is.
It's a common thing for you, you use it.
But today the country wants to do a great thing that is a society that is not noticed.
It's not really possible that a hundred percent of the society cannot be noticed.
But can't we change into a bit of a notice society
If you start a slightly surveillance society once, the unnoticed society will not be far away.
You know what opportunities are today for the unnoticed society, digital banking or mobile banking.
All banks are providing online access.
All banks in India have mobile apps.
All banks have their own valets.
Wallat means e-pers.
Various types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards.
The use of very few RuPay cards increased by 300 times after the eighth date.
Like a prepaid card on mobile phone, prepaid cards are available for spending money from the bank.
Not only this, technology is simplifying as it doesn't need a big smart phone.
I was focusing on making these arrangements more smooth.
All banks are trying to do it.
My young friends, this is a great generation that doesn't know anything.
I know very well that you're all working on this great thing.
I have seen the creative messages you give in the Watts App - printing, poems, short stories, cartoons, new imaginations, sports.
However, my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this.
Your mobile phone will have all the components of online expenses.
Not only this, teach at least ten families at least half an hour, one hour and two hours every day how to use this technology and how to download the bank's App.
The poor will bless you once they teach people how to use the RuPay card.
If they teach all this to the common people, they will probably get rid of all worries.
I don't think that if all the youth of India are involved in this thing, it will take a long time.
Within a month, we can present a new India in front of the world.
You can do this on your mobile phone, you can go to ten homes a day, you can connect ten houses with this every day.
I invite you, come, not just support, but we can be the commander of this change, change and rest.
We will take this war to liberate the country from corruption and corruption.
That country has made a revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again urge you to take this initiative forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCCs and NSS to do this together.
Let's take this forward.
We have got the opportunity to do a good service to the nation.
You shouldn't lose this chance.
You must have seen that the most famous artist Amitabh Swachh Bharat Mission of this century is moving forward very heartily.
This is why he remembered the birth anniversary of his father and his cleanliness.
He has written a verse of a poem by Harivansharai ji, "I am a soothing mind, a comfortable life.
"Mittika Man, Mastika Man, Kashan Man, Kashan Man Jeevan, his son, Shri Amitabh ji's veins flow like blood.
With the poem of Harivansh Raiji, he has written to me - clean body, clean mind, clean India, that is me.
I salute Harivansharai ji.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and happiness in every corner of India.
India is a country that celebrates any festival in any corner of the country 365 days.
We have seen the courage to finish uncultivated festivals.
The changes in festivals have been naturally adopted as per the needs of time and society.
Do it on festivals.
These things were linked to our ancestors in a very scientific way.
Today, the world is discussing the environment.
Whether it is trees or plants or rivers or animals or mountains or birds, there were festivals responsible for all.
It means that even the holidays in our country were celebrated with brahminda and science.
Today, when we celebrate Deepavali, as I said, this festival of ours brings information and knowledge.
This Deepawali is a message to the Taj Mahal from the darkness to the light.
All parts of the house are cleaned up.
We have to enlarge this nature and tradition.
Deepawali is no longer within the border of India.
Deepawali is celebrated in a different way in every country of the world.
Many governments and parliamentarians of the world are participating in the celebration of Diwali.
Whether it is eastern countries or western countries, whether it is a developing country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, all the festivals of Diwali will be seen there.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepawali has shared a picture of lightning in the film.
He also participated in an interactive session by the British Prime Minister during the Deepawali celebrations in London.
What's in that picture...
The Prime Minister of Australia, Shri Narendra Modi has called upon the people of various cities of Australia to participate in the Deepawali celebrations along with the Deepawali greetings to the Indian community.
Last day, the Prime Minister came to New ealand.
He said he had to return to the festival of Deepawali soon.
It indicates that this festival of light, Deepawali, is becoming an inspiration to take the world from darkness to light.
When the children burst their teeth, the elders have to stay closer, take care of them without any obstacles.
The festival of Deepawali in our country is a little longer.
Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
Whether I talk of Diwali or of Chhath Puja, this is really an opportunity for all of you to fulfil the auspicious time.
But this is also an opportunity to express gratitude and thanks to the countrymen.
Our soldiers have sacrificed their lives for our peace and peace due to the events that have taken place in the past few months.
When we celebrate Deepavali, our soldiers suffer all kinds of hardships... some in the desert, some in the Himalayas, some in the Himalayas, some in the Himalayas, some in the Himalayas, some in the Himalayas...
How many responsibilities
Words, birds, palms, colors, innumerable imaginations...
I can imagine how proud the people of my country are.
I am glad that you are smiling and because of yourself I say the truth is that you are sleeping peacefully because you are sleeping peacefully because you are bowing down to the Mountains, the Mountains, the Ambaras and the Punkavanas of India, and as I end the culmination and the culmination of you.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani gave me a message in the telephone with her parents' house, husband's house and soldiers.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am talking about Shivani Mahotsav.
Our soldiers are getting a lot of encouragement through the launch of this Deepawali Message to Jawan.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in the army.
I mean, my family is full of soldiers.
It is a good message that the border officers get a lot of encouragement, and everybody in the Army Circle gets encouragement.
Their families and their wives sacrifice a lot with the Army Officers and Soldiers.
In a way, there is a good message for the military, and I wish you all the best of Diwali.
My dear countrymen, we can see that the soldiers are not only on the border but also on all walks of life.
Even if there are natural calamities, the law and order have to be dealt with with enemies, if we have to dare bring back the wrong youth... our soldiers are working nationally in every sphere of life.
In the first place, Sikkim is now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala is likely to be on November 1.
The name of his village is Badhan.
He was there and was discussing how to build a toilet.
Some families have seen that toilets cannot be built due to financial hardships.
57 families have been given a thousand rupees from their pockets and have been able to achieve cleanliness.
This has given Himachal Pradesh the strength to make Open Defecation Free.
In the far-flung jungles of Kerala, there is a tribal village that can hardly reach the whole day.
People don't go there.
It has been decided that all the engineering students of the Cadet, National Service Scheme will join hands and build toilets there.
Things are progressing rapidly in all the states.
Sometimes I've just taken it.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the citizens of these states for their contribution in ignoring the blindness of the country as part of this great achievement.
My dear countrymen, the schemes of the government will be extremely important and after the first project, the second such project will have to be abandoned.
But generally no one pays attention to these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always guided us.
You decide on this criterion.
We have to face the awakening hopes of the poor in the country, which is the need of the hour.
Now girls have toilets in schools and boys have toilets.
It is no longer possible to be 20th century and still blind in the village.
Therefore, the programme to provide electricity to the village from the blindness is going on successfully.
Efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to 5 crore households.
Small businessmen, small businessmen, vegetable traders, milk sellers, drunkards etc. were caught in the hands of the robbers.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Accounts, etc. are successful programmes for the release of fraudsters.
Directly investing money to Aadhaar Lude Bank and the deserving will get direct money
It's an opportunity for ordinary people to get rid of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, Tomorrow 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary is the birth anniversary of the great personality of the country's unity.
I think he won it and he joined everyone together.
On the same day we can say that Indira Gandhi was assassinated and that the fate of the country was oppressed or unfortunate.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who lived all his life for unity, the cruelty made by Sardar on the birth anniversary of Sardar has given us a pain in history.
Stay away from the thoughts of the territories and the activities of the territories and keep the country from it.
Sardar Saheb's lifelong journey is in a fight for the farmers.
He was the son of the farmer.
Sardar Saheb had a great and great role in bringing freedom to the farmers.
Now we're listening to the name of Atul.
People from outside India are familiar with all the products of Atul and even today in India, but very few people know that it is the result of Sardar Saheb's philosophy that he thought of the Union of Cooperative Milk Producers.
He gave importance to this thinking in 1942.
How it was, we are directly in front of us as a source of comfort and prosperity for the farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb with honour.
In this lonely day, on 31st October, we must remember Sardar Saheb wherever we are.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Deepawali is a glimpse of Kartika Purnima and it is a festival of light.
The knowledge and advice given by Guru Nanak Dev is not only for Hindustan but also for the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was good for all.
Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo was made his colleague when there was a diversity of caste, casteism and intellectuality.
Let us follow that wise mandate that we have to do something against the differences that inspires us to abandon the differences. If Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, then who is better than Guru Nanak Dev
Guru Nanak Dev on the occasion of this festival.
My dear countrymen, once again in the name of the soldiers of the country, on this occasion of Diwali, many auspicious occasions to you all.
Your dreams, your imaginations can be achieved in every sense.
May your life be comfortable and peaceful.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, addressed the gathering at Akashwani on September 20, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, you all are greeted.
We lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector in the past.
I salute all these heroines and pay attention to them.
This loss was lost to the son, the brother lost, not only the families who lost their husband.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're in our army.
There are many opportunities for parents and politicians to speak.
Every parents want all schools and colleges to start functioning completely.
They want their crops and fruits to be brought to markets across India.
I mean, economic business also wants to be right.
Over the past few days, the business has started working well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace for our problems, the path of progress and the path of development.
We have to scale new heights of expansion for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find peace together for all the problems and will prove the right path for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the ancestors of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government will have to take certain measures to continue the law and order.
I would like to tell the security forces that the power and the laws of our day are used for regulation, for the comfortable and peaceful lives of the common people of Kashmir, they should be properly followed by our security forces.
Sometimes those who think differently than we are thinking put forward new ideas.
I get a chance to know a lot from the social media in the near future.
It gives an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of all kinds of people from all corners of India, which encourages the strength of democracy.
Last day, a child named Harshavardhan of the eleventh grade presented a different idea to me.
He wrote, "After the terror attack in Uri, I felt sorry, I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do... what a little teacher like me can do.
Yes, the child showed it with a creative view.
But when the 1965 war took place, we were led by Lal Bahadur Shastri, and there was an excitement, fury, the fate of patriotism.
Everyone wanted to do something or the other.
Lal Bahadur Shastriji tried very well to touch this emotional level of the country.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and inspired the common man of the country how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Scientist was showing that there would be other ways to show patriotism in the midst of bombs and guns and noise.
When Mahatma Gandhi led a movement for freedom, when the struggle was strong, the struggle required a step forward, then the power was immensely useful in turning it back to creative things in society.
Let us and the army define their responsibilities, let the administrators define their duties. If all our fellow citizens share something creatively with the spirit of this patriotism, the country will certainly scale new heights.
Dear Countrymen, Shri T.
Kartik Narendra Modi wrote to me the App Lude, the ultimates to participate in the Paralympics wrote history, their performance is the victory of humanity and human spirit.
Not only you two, but all the people of the country have made an emotional correlation with our sportspersons in Paralympics.
Perhaps Para Olympics have transformed the benefits of our sportspersons and the vision of mankind towards divinity.
I won't forget the words of our victorious sister Deepak Malik.
When the medal was won, the sister said, I have defeated handicappedness through this medal.
These words have great power.
This time, in Para Olympics, there were 19 litres, including three women from our country.
In comparison to other games, Divyang's games have a greater desire and determination than physical capabilities and sports skills.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have achieved 4 medals with the biggest achievement so far - two gold, one silver and the second gold medal in Paul Volt 12 years later.
He was losing his hand because of the electric shock.
You can imagine that if a man gets the second gold medal at the age of twenty-thirds after receiving the gold medal at the age of thirty-thirds, how much he has done.
Mariappan won gold medals on the highway.
Thank you, you lost yourself in five years.
Poverty and his determination have not been interrupted.
He's not a big city, not a middle-class family.
Whether it leads a life full of hardships, physical hardships, it has achieved a medal for the country through uncertainties.
If it's Light Deepawali, it's rocked in a variety of victories.
Come on C.
Brothers and sisters, we've won the Venkala Medal at the Hayjam.
It is also important that we have inspired us to look at our divine brothers and sisters in our country, in our society and in our neighbourhood.
We must awaken our sympathy and also change our vision for this divine city.
A few days ago, Olympics competitions took place at the same place.
Is it possible for anyone to think that even the people of Divyang broke the records of the public organisations
And this time too.
In the coming days, India is trying to create a smooth programme for the Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
It told the people I was there, and people were surprised.
I had the opportunity to release a book, which showcased the success stories of the lives of some Divyangs.
There were very encouraging events.
I believe that the establishment of World Records on the soil of India's New Year is a great thing.
Within eight hours, hundreds of people with disabilities have been able to enter the machines.
It's got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It means that the country has taken a hundred and fifty crore steps towards cleanliness.
We have been able to see how well the consequences are moving in the right direction and what is happening with a little effort.
Whether it is a simple tradition, administrator or administrator, administrator or administrator, whether it is a road or a bus stand or a railway or a school or a college, whether it is a hospital or a hospital or a hospital, from children to old people, poor villages and women all play their role in the cause of cleanliness.
Friends from the media also played a creative role.
To make health and dignity of the parents, especially the mothers and sisters, we must end the winter that is dedicated to the open space.
So, the Open Defecation Free (ODF) has started a mass movement in the open space.
A healthy competition is being held between the States and the States and the districts.
States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be able to achieve success in a very short time on the path of freedom from open defecation.
Come on, let's move forward.
In particular, in the next few days, I would like to present a scheme to young friends using technology in a big way.
Everyone has the right to know what is peace in your city in terms of cleanliness, for which Indians have given a number - 1969.
We know Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
If you call this number 1969, you will not be able to understand the condition of construction of toilets, but you will be allowed to make toilets.
You're going to benefit from it.
Moreover, a Cleanliness App has been launched to know about cleanliness related complaints and redressal of complaints.
You use this as much as you can, especially the new generation.
Indians have requested the corporate world to come forward.
Those who want to work for cleanliness should sponsor young professionals.
Cleanliness can be sent to the districts through Fellows.
In today's era, health has been linked to cleanliness, similarly cleanliness is essential for it.
It must be part of the dust to wealth.
Therefore, with the mission of cleanliness, we must turn to the West to Compost.
Fertilizer told the companies that they should be ready to buy a compost from the waste.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers, Mayors and commissioners from all over the country are going to hold very serious discussions on cleanliness and hygiene.
What can be done with technology
How can we get employment through this
Discussions will take place on such issues.
I see new news about cleanliness.
Today, I was informed in the newspaper that students from Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and made awareness about the construction of toilets.
A team of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh launched a 2800-kilometer journey from Devprayag to Gangasagar in Ganga.
Every department of the Government of India has prepared a timetable for one year.
I would like to urge the parasites to interact with them in the works being carried out by these departments.
Everything about cleanliness is happening today.
First of all, 73 cities were surveyed and the cleanliness system was presented to the people.
Now there is a turn of 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh.
This time we are lagging behind, next time we will have a confidence in every city that we will do a little better.
This is October 2, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It's been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission started.
Deepawali's lamp will be demonstrated in the house of the poor and this time it is October 2 and Sunday.
Can't yourself participate in the removal of waste in a parameter 2 hours and 4 hours directly
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
Joy of Giving Week is going to be celebrated in many cities from 2nd to 8th October in collaboration with O.
It is aimed at delivering food items and clothes to the needy.
The Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's centenary year begins today.
Antyodaya Siddhartha is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefit of development
Let us focus on how the poor can avail the benefits of the concentration of the society, the citizens and everyone.
I salute the Hon'ble Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, who was an inspiration for all of us, who was rich in our formal legacy.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, I started Mann Ki Baat on the occasion of Vijayadashmi.
I have tried myself not to be a pioneering programme of Mann Ki Baat.
This Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme of political and criminal activities.
How can I be inspired by the common man in this country
It means that Mann Ki Baat is not a discussion in 15-20 minutes earlier, it has become a new opportunity for social transformation.
Anyone else will be more happy than this.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, addressed the gathering at Akashwani, on August 20, 2016, at 11am.
My dear countrymen, today is the birthday of Hockey magician Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
He played a crucial role in achieving the gold medal in Hockey in Olympics in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of us like Christians have heard Bradman's name.
He said about Dhyanchand, "His Scores goals licences".
Dhyanchandji was a living example of Sportsman Spirit and patriotism.
Once upon a time in Kolkata, an opponent was hit by a hockeystick on the head of Dhyan Chand.
So there's only 10 minutes left to end the game.
Dhyanchand put three goals in that ten minutes and responded with goals.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time comes for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of opinion in the MyGov or the Narendra Modi App.
Full of varieties.
But this time everyone wants me to say something about Rio Olympics.
I am very hopeful that the Prime Minister of the country, with the aspiration to say something about it, is so close to the Olympics for the common citizens.
There is so much love and so much awareness among the citizens of India in the field of cricket-free sports.
Our daughters have once again proved that they are not far behind anyone.
It seems that girls from all over India have taken the mission to empower India.
Shekhar Thakur wrote in MyGov that we could do better in Olympics.
He wrote, "First congratulations on winning two medals in Adrani Modisar and Riyoy.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
Our parents focus on studies and academic issues today.
The society is still considered to lose time for sports.
It's important to change this thinking.
The enthusiasm of the society must be increased.
Nobody can do this better than you.
We cannot deny that we cannot do such a thing as we hoped.
In some cases our sportspersons have shown good performance in India, but the good performance here has not been expected.
We only got two medals in the medal list.
But if you don't get the medal, you will be able to see a good exhibition in many of these things.
You see, our Abhinav Bindraji reached the fourth position in the shooting, and he lost his medal in a very short span.
That's what happened in Tennys about Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopan's pair.
We have performed well in the electric.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, the simplified Babar Track and Field Film has been successful.
It is heartening to know that the women hockey team has reached Olympics after 36 years.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the men have reached the outset stage in Hockey.
Our team is very strong.
Many sportspersons, for example, Aditi Ashok, Datu Bhokanal, and Das.
But, dear countrymen, we have many things to do.
But if we do as we do again, perhaps we will be disappointed again.
We'll prepare a framework on how we can be better.
The scheme is to be formulated with a far-reaching approach to 2020, 2024, 2028.
What can we do in the field of sports, what can we do for every state of our country
States should choose one or two of their own strengths.
I appeal to the Sports Associations that they should be neutralized.
I appeal to every citizen of India to send me an opinion on what is interested in Narendra Modi App.
We're fully prepared.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is a teacher day.
I have spent a lot of time with students on teachers' day for years and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from little children.
For me, 5th September was a teacher's day and a teacher's day.
But this time I have to attend the G-20 Summit, so I have decided to express my feelings in Mann Kiba.
Teachers have the same place as their mother has in life.
I've seen teachers who are more concerned about themselves than their own.
They dedicate their lives for their teachers, for their students.
Now, after Rio Olympics, Putella is talking about Gopichand all around.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand, his penance and his dedication to Sports, his way of happiness in the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our lives.
The President of India, Dr.
The nation is on the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnanji, the Prime Minister said.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
Even today, he seems to teach me in the classroom.
He's still giving me the Cursepondence Course.
It will be astonished that in this age of nineteen years, when he sees his letter, he writes such beautiful letters at this age.
My letter is very bad and I feel very honourable to see somebody's nice letter.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh festival is coming closer.
The divisions of the Ganesh cannot be divided into the lives of our country, our society, our family, and every one of us.
The celebration of the Commonwealth Festival is a world-class philosopher, which has made this religious festival a tour of awakening the country.
Even today, the Ganesh festival is being celebrated not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
All the youngsters are making preparations for this festival and are very enthusiastical.
Some people are still trying to abstain from any emotion that the world's thinker has put forward.
Discussions on public issues, articles, flowers festivals.
In its vision, the issues touching the society are very artistic.
In a way, a massive campaign of public education is underway through the Ganesh festival.
The world-class self-respect has inspired us to be our birthright.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
Festival gives a new dimension to the lives of individuals and society.
Life is impossible without a festival, but it has to be built in time.
This time many people have specially written to me about the Ganesh festival and Durga Puja.
You should use Ganeshji made of soil in the village pond.
The idols made of the Plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment.
He and many others have suffered a lot.
I want to appeal to you and I want to build idols of Ganesh and Durga Devi and return to our old traditions.
Ganesh is a rebellion.
We shouldn't create a disintegrated gesture.
I don't know how much you accept me, but this is not what I say, many say.
Several such institutions are very eager to build a soiled monster.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
If you make the river in the lake with a chirp, it will go into it again and there will be no harm to the environment.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will declare Mother Teresa as sacred on 4th September.
Mother Teresa used her life to serve the poor people of India.
It is natural for every Indian to feel proud that Mother Teresa, who has served the poor throughout his life, is being given a sacred place.
The Government of India, under the leadership of our External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj, is sending an official delegation for 125 crore citizens on this occasion on September 4.
We can learn something from the saints, the sages, the saints and the great men.
We keep earning something, learning, doing something good.
My dear countrymen, how much change happens when development becomes a mass movement.
The power of the people is regarded as another form of God.
The Government of India has successfully tried to clean Ganga for five State Governments in collaboration with the Government of India in the last few days.
On 20th of this month, a meeting of the village chiefs on the banks of Ganga was called in Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for taking this idea forward.
I thanked the Chief Ministers and Chief Ministers of the five states for the great Kalvaype in cleaning the Ganga with the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, sometimes things touch my mind and I am particularly honoured to those people who have created these ideas.
On July 15, more than one lakh students from around 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote letters to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
They told their parents in that letter that they wanted toilet toilets in their homes.
And they said that some people wrote that this year did not celebrate their birthday, but certainly wanted to make toilets.
This is what we inspire.
A 16-year-old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka, Lama, has committed a sincerity against her family.
The family wasn't financially capable.
The child stood firm at the dawn.
The village chief, Mohammad Shafi, had arranged for Rs. 15,000 and made toilets within a week.
The strength of a girl named Malma and the head of a village like Mohammad Shafi are commendable.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of all Indians.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have made this their goal.
This information is available on the web site.
The award will be given to the winners on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October.
I want to tell the TV channels that you too want to urge and compete for films like this.
Creativeity will be strong for waste generation, new seals will be available, new methods will be known, new motivations will be given.
All this will be done through the collaboration of people and ordinary artists, whether there is a big studio or a big camera to make films.
Everyone may think that the President will inaugurate a radio channel.
But this is not an ordinary radio channel, a big step.
Our neighbourhood is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Mithri and Bangladesh Batar will share their programmes and people from both sides will enjoy the activities of Akashwani.
AIR's contribution to manufacture individual relations is very big.
The President inaugurated it.
I thanked Bangladesh for their cooperation with us.
I convey my best wishes to Akashwani for their participation in foreign exchange.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of becoming Prime Minister, but I am a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart more.
Such emotional incidents provide new energy and inspire, which inspires the people of India to do something.
I bow down to millions of mothers of India who have struggled to help others with their own hardships.
My dear countrymen, we suffered due to deficit last year, but this month of August has caused difficulties due to continuous rains.
In some parts of the country there was a flood again.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the Local Freedom Funds, the Social Institutions and the Citizens have tried their best to do whatever they can.
But I heard some other news about the flood, and I had to remember it more.
The month of August will recall what will be the strength of unity and how much change will be brought together.
In August 2016, all the parties in the Parliament have passed the GST Act simultaneously, with almost 90 such parties, non-partisan parties and native parties, to oppose each other.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is an example of how big things can be achieved if all the parties move together in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties in the country simultaneously talked about the events and situations in Kashmir.
I believe in the power of hundred twenty five crore people.
This morning I had the opportunity to spend with some young people of Delhi.
I hope that in the coming days, all the youth of the country will drown in the colors of excitement in the games of Olympics.
The whole world will be in the games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons everywhere.
I will surely send a message to the sportspersons on the site of Narendra Modi App.
Come, let us all join together and try to increase the dignity and self-esteem of all our leaders and appreciate their efforts.
You can hear a poem on the occasion of talking to you about Rio Olympics, a student from Punjab Central University, who is interested in poetry.
There will be other poets like this, they must have written such poems, write some more, some may have composed music of poems.
I want to share the poem that Suraj sent me with you.
A young man named Mr. Ankit Karke reminded me of the anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam.
Therefore, Mr. Angie has inspired him to write down what steps your government has taken to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The next century will be guided by technology.
If someone tries to seize it, it will appear in new apparatus somewhere far and wide, if we want to take technology forward.
Therefore, we can adopt research and innovation as technologies.
Innovation, periment, entrepreneurship, etc. , the possibility of employment availability is also increasing.
If we adopt a second generation of innovation, our children will join it.
That's why the Indians started the Atal Tinkering Abbs.
10 lakhs will be provided to the participants and another 10 lakh rupees will be provided for the next 5 years.
Likewise, the incubation center is directly related to innovation.
In order to make self-sufficient incubation centres necessary, we can create a systematic delivery mechanism for start-ups for innovation.
Creation of new incubation centres and innovation of old age is essential.
We have to face many problems in everyday life.
The mind wants to recover soon after the disease, so eat something antibiotic.
You might have been freed for a while, but you must stop the method of taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
We don't eat antibiotic until we write a doctor.
We don't travel through this kind of leech.
And this war will go on for years to build new medicines and conduct scientific research.
Until then, these diseases continue to cause new problems.
So we must always be aware of this.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Eat 15 pills and the doctor will tell you to eat it in five days.
The doctor should finish the course by eating the pills on the same day as he suggests.
Even after taking more medicine it will be beneficial for the germs .
So, for how many days the doctor proposes, it's a big deal to keep it.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, it is necessary to keep the laws to be used as per the use of antibiotics.
Our government is committed to defend the antibiotic resistance.
You might have seen a red light on the part of the information provided by the antibiotics sold today.
I beg you to take care of it.
I would like to add another thing to health.
I am concerned about the lives of our country's pregnant women.
It is impossible to say that when there is an infection in pregnancy and after pregnancy, infection related to childbirth, and high blood pressure, any kind of difficulties that destroy their lives.
For these reasons, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission for the past few months, i. e.
Under this mission, all pregnant women on the 9th of every month are available free of cost at Government Health Centres.
I am primarily requesting the genecologists that one day in a month, i.e., on the 9th, cannot provide this service free of cost for the poor mothers.
I'm sure you'll be part of it.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
There are socio-cultural discussions in the country and around the world.
India has been focusing on this for centuries.
The Kurukshetra is discussing the Krishna Bhagwan trees in the battlefield.
It has been stated in the court that there is no medicinal herbs without medicinal plants.
The tree gives the tree to transform the tree into a world like its own poems.
Therefore, the parents who want their own good will have to plant good trees and protect them like peasants.
Whether it is Geeta or Shukracharya or Mahabharata, there are some people who live in these ideals in today's generation.
A few days ago, I took care of a daughter from Pune, Sonal, one of my kind.
It touched my mind.
Saying that the tree is fulfilling the responsibilities of the people across the globe, Sonal has taken an effort to fulfil the desires of the society, not only of his parents.
Kisan Ghamdu, a village named Narayanpur in Kejunar Talluk, Pune, Maharashtra, married his daughter Pautri Sonal in a very incentive manner.
I saw the picture in the social media.
I didn't see the dragons on the wedding, but the plants were merely visual.
This is a picture that touches the mind.
Sonal is an architect of graduation, and this idea is hers.
You will see how great nature has shown to those who have come to the wedding by offering gifts to them.
In other words, the marriage of Sonal has become an eternal story of nature, and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Mr. Maharaj for this innovative endeavour.
This can be transformed into a natural mass of trees.
The Government of Maharashtra, on 1st July this year, has decided to plant around 2. 5 crore trees across the state and plant three crore trees next year.
It is not simple to plant 25 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan know how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its greenery by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat has a brilliant tradition of forest festivals.
This year, several names like Gujarat Mao Jungle, Ekta Jungle and Martyr Jungle have been ordered to plant millions of trees by providing wildlife sanctuaries.
But for me, the South African journey was a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela in the context of South Africa.
When we hear the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phoeni Settlement and Mahatma Gandhis residence is known as Sarvodaya.
I got the privilege of travelling from Pieter Maritburg station on the train travelled by Mahatma Gandhi, and this is the incident which gave a fare to Mahatma Gandhi.
I would like to tell you this time that I have got the opportunity to meet many dignitaries who have come here for equality and equal opportunity throughout their youth.
Nelson Mandela fought with his shoulders and spent his life in prisons with him in 20-22.
I am fortunate to see the great friends of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Tathatta, Mr. Lalu iba, Mr. George Baisos and Ronnie Casirils.
Even after such a great curiosity, the feelings of gaining, playing, etc. could not be seen.
I have seen in them a vision of a dramatic attitude - that is, the symptoms of the duties mentioned in Geeta.
No society and government have a poetry in this regard.
Their thoughts are natural.
They told me about an incident, talking about sculptures from Bangalore.
A woman was betrayed in a froda chit-mail and erased 11 lakh rupees and then read the news she committed suicide in an article.
As a woman, I feel sorry for her family.
I want to know what you think about such a chit-froad mail.
In a few minutes, I realized he'd lost everything.
Sometimes you'll be mistaken.
They're gonna be so nice.
But I had a very pleasant experience in this neighborhood.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The boys and girls were very excited.
They came with a big album and enjoyed their faces.
An artistic painting was conducted at the station.
Besides, all the plastic bottles and oil utensils found in the rural areas have been collected and planted and planted by the Vertical Garden.
And on one side of the railway station, this vertical garden has been constructed in plastic bottles and given a new impression.
My dear countrymen, the times of festivals have come in our country for years.
Just imagine, don't you give her a gift that protects her life, and there will be women who cook food in our house.
She'll be the daughter of a poor mother.
That's the right meaning of a survivor.
My dear countrymen, many of us are born in an independent age.
I am the first Prime Minister born in the post-independence era.
Let the entire country imbibe the spirit of freedom fighters, let us once again propagate the brutality of freedom.
Let's all create this atmosphere.
And the Independence Day celebrations should not be a government programme, but a programme of the people of the country.
We must celebrate our own like Deepavali.
I would also like you to do something good with the inspiration from patriotism in patriotism.
The pictures must be sent to the Narendra Modi App.
Create an atmosphere of its own in the country.
You might want that things in your mind should be depicted from the Red Fort with the same calmness.
As your representative, I invite you, if I want to tell you these things from the Red Fort as your main servant.
I don't want the Prime Minister to be the Prime Minister of the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the platform of technology is easy for you to bring things to me.
I am grateful to Akashwani for presenting Mann Ki Baat in local languages at 8:00 p.m.
Nine of these suggestions are helpful in the work of my government.
Perhaps it's a week to start the rainy season, as well as our concern.
It is extremely hot in most parts of the country.
Climate change enhances such problems.
The forest area's widespread trees were cut.
In a way, humans themselves destroy nature and humiliate themselves.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
Discussions are being held around the world about the environment.
The forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and the Himalayan valleys have become victorious in the past few days.
I have got the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha in the last 11 days.
I listened carefully to every country.
No such sustainable discussion has taken place before how much amount has been spent by the Union Government in general.
In a way, the fact that the entire country has shown excellent work for water conservation, environment, drought violation, animal husbandry and drying up was also one of the factors of the Indian government.
I told NITI Aayog that by adopting good ideals, we must take steps to implement it in other states.
Some states, particularly Andhra and Gujarat, have fully benefitted from technology.
I would like to take the successful tests of the States to other areas through NITI Aayog.
In such a situation, public participation is a major component of success.
Perhaps, if there is a comprehensive planning, by using appropriate technology and finishing the systems within the stipulated timeframe, there can be a significant change, so I believe.
Irrigation is also important.
Their target is to incorporate 2-3 lakh hectares of land in micro-irrigation every year.
Chattisgarh Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan has been implemented.
About 22,000 ponds have been added to the Balram Talab Yojana in Madhya Pradesh, which is not a small number.
They had aimed at water conservation in some states, and in some states, projects for water conservation of 10-20 km of water were implemented.
It's a good experience.
I would like to say that even a drop of rain from June, July, August and September should not lose water.
We have to think about how the water conservation space should be.
God has provided water according to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
We'll be incapable of seeing a lot of water and when it's rainy, we'll be sorry for how long.
In the last few days, media spoke of the difficulties of water availability.
I believe that media will be able to pave the way for water conservation.
I invite them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
Make a transparent India.
Our programmes must be carried out in every corner of India in a similar way without any accumulations.
We have to make some changes in our old attitudes.
But today the situation has completely changed.
The world looks like a cashless society.
Electronic technology is capable of sending and handling money from anywhere in the world.
When we come together, we can resume as a wealthy society.
You might have seen that RPA has been given CARD along with Jan Dhan account.
In the coming days, this card can be used on the grounds of credit debit card.
No need for money, count or anything from the pocket.
This is the Bank on Mobile - Universal Payment Interface Banking Transaction - PI which will transform the systems in a sustainable manner.
Money Transaction through your mobile phone will be much easier.
Perhaps, if this is possible, RPA CARDs don't always have to be carried along.
Moreover, the post offices are also engaged in banking services.
Anti-law deals will last forever.
The impact of black money will be greater.
So, my countrymen, I want - let's start this.
If we start once, we'll be able to move very easily.
Today, somebody might have thought about how many mobile phones would be in our hands.
That's how we don't have money.
It would have been better if it had happened without a call.
My dear countrymen, sometimes when the Olympics Competition comes, when the game starts, we will be far behind the Golden Medal.
I wish I had the silver.
Encouraging our sportspersons to participate in the Rio Olympics, one must encourage self-confidence and enthusiasm in their own way.
Over the past week, we were all worried about the results of elections, particularly the results of Assam.
Encouraging sportspersons and encouraging our sportspersons, these things give a lot of spirituality and strength to each other.
India should open its doors to the world with a sportsman spirit without emerging everybody in the light of victory.
Throughout the year, the results of students studying in 10 and 12 classes have been followed one by one.
I want to tell those who have not been able to win. There is a lot to do in life.
A Mr. Gambhir in Madhya Pradesh...
Sahitya Patel presented a great deal of trouble before me.
33 percent of the market wasn't happy.
Everyone told me that I lost 90 percent of the 4 marks.
I don't know what I felt like a weight.
I read your letter seriously.
I think, perhaps this pain is not yours.
There are millions of students like you, because this is an environment.
Can we lead the society towards peace and satisfaction by finding satisfaction in all matters
Your relatives, colleagues and friends are 89.
I have written to Anandgiri Goswami from Jodhpur about the same thing.
He says people from my neighbourhood don't accept our results.
I don't remember the whole poetry if it was better... but I had written a poet a long time ago, and I painted a painting in the canvas of life.
Some said it would be better if it were yellow instead of blue.
Some said it would have been better if it were there instead of putting the record here.
It would have been better if one or two had seen a picture of my pain.
Everyone was talking about the tape.
Millions of students like you are the same.
You are capable of fulfilling the needs of the people.
I want to tell you so much that you don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everyone expresses the need.
But remain firm in your mind and try to fill a little more beautifully.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability, then the new goal will never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of great success.
The untouchables of victory are not the tricks of success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of Santoor's propaganda.
There was a time when Santoor Vadodara was associated with folk music in the Kashmir Valley.
But a man named Pandit Shiva Kumar had taken it in his hand and finished it as a great advisory in the world.
Shehnai - our music world was in very limited places.
Most of the king's darbars were found at its gate.
But when Ustad Bismulakhan took over in Shehna, it became a universal instrument.
It is true that the cost is very low for not being a patient, but the cost of recovering health is very high.
If anyone can help the poor, it's only for cleanliness.
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
All over the world, Yoga has a special significance, respect and trust.
Yoga offers the strength to lead a balanced life to the world that is bent on tension.
Every person should spend 20-25 minutes in his lifestyle or 30 minutes in yoga.
For this, we are inspired by the 21st Yoga Day.
Sometimes a social environment is responsible for bringing about changes in the life of a person.
I hope you'll take the lead wherever you are on June 21.
In your neighbourhoods, in your city, in villages, in your schools and institutions, even in your office.
Start a month from now, and look, you'll be part of it on June 21.
I'm going to attend Chandigarh this time.
My dear countrymen, I am constantly interacting with you through this programme Mann Ki Baat.
I had given you a mobile number a long time ago and you could hear Mann Ki Baat by calling a mixed call.
But it's simpler.
You just need four times to hear Mann Ki Baat again.
If you call this number in 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat in any language anywhere.
My dear countrymen, once again my greetings to you.
Don't forget about the water I said.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is a time when I and you are waiting.
This time too many letters, comments, phone calls have been received.
People have been discussing books on science, technology, new inventions, history, culture, business, lifestyle, etc.
People asked me to discuss other flowers.
But I'll have to say I can't take time to read a lot of books.
Let us introduce a permanent book corner in the Narendra Modi App, when we read a new book, we can write it, discuss it.
You can suggest a name for this book corner.
I want this book corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Several experts have worked hard on water conservation.
People share knowledge about traditional methods.
For example, the excitement of rural water conservation in the village Aara Karam in Ormanji Block, a little away from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become a commendable example for all.
The beautiful state of north-eastern India, Meghalaya has become a state of its own water.
I congratulate the government there.
A lot of water is needed in Haryana, but farmers are being given importance for the unemployed farming.
I also congratulate the Government of Haryana for discussing with the farmers, transforming them from traditional farming and inspiring them to cultivate less water.
Now it's time for festivals.
Festivals also take place during festivals.
You can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fairs.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be given very well, exhibitions, streets and the message of water conservation with the festival can be delivered to us very delicately.
Friends, some things in our lives are encouraging.
Especially the achievements of children and their actions give us new energy.
So I want to talk about some children.
They have written to Nidhi Baipa, Monish Joshi, Devamshiravat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Pachi Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranyatesh Ganguli, Hrithik Alamada.
I'm talking about them will fill your minds with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that the word 'cancer' is a terrible thing in the world.
After winning the game, the champion won the medal.
But it was a unique opportunity for them to become champions before participating in the competition.
That's the champions of life.
The World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
That is, in their lives, those who fought with the cancer, competitions like shooting, chess, swimming, race, football were held.
All these Champions of our country have won medals in the tournament.
Some of these sportspersons won medals in more than one.
My dear countrymen, you must have been proud of India's victory in the universe of the sky.
Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata and P.
2019 is a good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched ASAT in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this.
The country was proud to move from Chandrayaan 2 to Sriharikota on July 22.
The launch of Chandrayaan 2 has filled people with pride and enthusiasm.
Chandrayaan 2 missions are special in many ways.
You will be glad that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But always remember that it is capable of survival.
I have great hope that Chandrayaan will inspire the youth of the country to turn the world into science and invention.
Finally, science is opening the path of development.
On the surface of the moon, we are awaiting indefinitely the time of the launch of the Lander Victor and the Rover Procedure.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to inform the students of the country about an attractive competition with the youth.
I would like to invite the youngsters of the country to a quiz competition, and the curiosity of space-related journals, Indias science mission and scientific technologies.
I appeal to young friends and students to participate in this issue and make this attractive and enjoyable and unforgettable through your partnership.
I specially urge the school and the enthusiastic principals and teachers to try their best to win their school.
Encourage all schools to join this.
This will be a historic event in their lives for the successful students.
But it has to be attended by a problem, achieving the highest mark, achieving success.
Inspire more and more friends.
My dear friends, you must have noticed something.
Our Mann Ki Baat has increased rapidly from time to time to achieve Swachhata.
When they performed their skills from the walls of over-bridges and schools to the huts, people joined them and it became a big initiative.
You must have seen how Prayag Raj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh Mela.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a major role in these things.
We need to develop the culture of wealth from waste in our society.
In a way, we have to move from waste to gold.
My dear countrymen, last day, I read a very attractive word in MyGov.
This command belonged to Bhai Muhammad Aslam, who lived in Shapian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He is very happy to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I actively participated in organizing the Back to Village for Community Mobility programme in my state of Jammu Kashmir.
The event was held in June.
I think that such programmes should take place every three months.
Also, arrangements should be made to monitor the programme online.
This programme shows how impatient and enthusiastic the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
For the first time, a large number of officers came directly to the villages and the officers who had never seen the villagers had come to their homes to understand the hurdles in development.
There is a rush to increase the income of the people.
The villager also openly expressed his concerns about the impact of the service of the common man.
Discussions were also held on issues such as literacy, female ratio, health, waste, water conservation, electricity, water, girls' education and problems of elderly citizens.
Friends, this programme was not a function of the government that was roaming around the village all day long, but this time the authorities spent two days and one night in Panchmadi, which gave them the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added a lot of things to make this program more attractive.
Khelo India led a sports competition for children.
Sports Kit, Job Cards of National Employment Scheme, Species, Scheduled Tribes etc. were distributed there.
Our brother-in-law, brother-in-law of Kashmir, wants the government to call upon such programmes and peoples participation in this thing, and it is understood that the strength of progress is above the strength of the bombs and guns.
It is clear that those who want to hate the path of development, who want to create obstacles cannot achieve their immense objectives.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, the recipient of the Jnanpith Puraskar, spoke of the glory of the Shravana month in his poem.
In this, he said, "Hodige Madige Agyedu Agyedu Agydhu, the unprecedented land of Magana, which separates the ties between the hunting and the current of the rain, the earth is blossoming in its beauty.
People from all over India, from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Shravan in their own ways.
When we look around in this climate, the earth looks green.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, many fast on the other side, with passion, wait for products like Janmashtami and Nagapanchami.
During this time, the Raksha Bandhan Festival is a symbol of the affection of sisters and brothers.
During the last four years, more devotees participated in the Amarnath Yatra this time.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh pilgrims visited the cave.
More than 60 days in 2015, more people participated in 28 days this time.
I specially congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
People coming back from the journey are changing the zeal and self-confidence of the people of the state.
All of these are very helpful in the future.
On the other hand, it is time for heavy rainfall in many parts of the country.
My dear countrymen, it is very difficult to decide where to start Mann Ki Baat and where to stop.
Next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
It is often seen that India is a country of economic fraternity through festivals.
Festivals change as an opportunity for economic fragrance to the poorest of the society.
You know I use technology well, so I get a lot of information.
Ganesh V.
Savesh Warker wrote this season as a tourist season.
Many national and foreign tourists are coming.
People also celebrate Christmas holidays.
Often we hear disappointments from many corners of the country.
It is the strength of the nation that millions of people do good in their own way as well as in the middle of the country.
Regular opportunities are being created for education and employment.
When the entire world was attracted by Yoga and celebrated the International Day of Yoga, we believed and proudly believed in the strength of India.
This imagination is reflected in our minds during the vast vision of India.
Today, the word Swachhta is heard in the houses.
The people's participation in it is increasing.
That's also a service route.
I've made a little effort in my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear youngsters, on 15th August, the Start-up India and Stand-up India had started a preliminary discussion on the Red Fort.
Thereafter, it was discussed in government departments.
Can India become a start-up capital
The new start-ups and new inventions, whether in the manufacturing sector, in the service sector or in the agriculture sector, are we able to start a big opportunity for the youth of the States.
It's wrong if you think so.
Youngsters from any corner of India should give them the opportunity.
Start-up India and Stand-up India cannot be sustained in a few cities.
This should spread to every corner of India.
I urge the State Governments to extend this.
On January 16, I will discuss this with you clearly.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear youngsters, January 12 is the victory of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions of people like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekanandan.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is celebrating 12th January as National Youth Festival.
It is being celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th to 16th January this year.
A small India is going to be created there - a young India.
In a way, the piece of dreams can be seen.
The power of decisions can be seen.
Can you share your suggestions on this young festival with me
I believe that this is the result of your action taken by you.
Thank you a thousand.
You're a person working in this area
So you can understand this, you have to suffer a lot of trouble.
Sometimes the disabled, sometimes the disabled, sometimes the vulnerable.
It is true that every word has its own greatness.
This year the Government of India has started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take this.
Have we started Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
This will facilitate ease of doing business by developing all kinds of infrastructure.
Whether it is schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway station ramps, parking, lifts, brailley lipids, they need innovation to make them easier.
Technology is necessary, the system is essential for sensitization.
It's already started and people's complications are getting.
People enjoy it.
Files shouldn't be stored before that.
In fact, plans are for the common people and the militia.
In the past, the Indian government has conducted an investigation into how to benefit the rightful owners of the schemes.
A subsidiary is given to gas cylinders in our country.
It wasn't checked whether the calculations were properly maintained.
Therefore, the government has made some changes in this.
The mission is to bring the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme in the world through Jan Dhan Account by integrating Aadhaar Card to Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
I am glad that the world's largest successful Director, Benefit Transfer Scheme, has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
On the one hand, Aadhaar Card Campine on the other, opening of Jan Dhan Accounts on the other, and integrating the beneficiaries with the Central State Governments, has continued to create a list of beneficiaries and link them to the bank account through Aadhaar.
Money is now invested directly into the workers' accounts in many places.
There were complaints about scholarship of students and efforts have been made to solve them.
Approximately 40 crore rupees have come directly to beneficiaries' accounts through various schemes.
Projects ranging from around thirty-five to forty-four have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
My dear Indians, January 26 is the golden moment of the India Republic.
Two days in the Parliament were put in place for a special discussion on the constitution.
It was a good experience.
We are conscious of the highest debts at the time of election, and it convinces us through advertising and writing that vote is our duty.
Why shouldn't we communicate ourselves about the duties in everyday life as in the election time
Shouldn't the country hold discussions in schools, colleges, villages, cities, organisations based on duties in view of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on January 26
If 125 crore people take one step after another and fulfill their duties, it will be an unprecedented history.
Let's start with the discussions.
You might have the opportunity to go somewhere.
Festivals have its own significance in social life.
There are reports of natural calamities continuously coming from every corner of the world.
We have never thought or imagined these evils.
The impact of climate change is increasing at a rapid pace.
The Centre works with their shoulders.
But when there are such miseries around the world, we have to think about the need for changes.
That's a good beginning.
Today, I received a message from Lakhvindersing from Jalnar in Punjab, I am speaking from Janantar district of Lucknow, Punjab.
"I was very happy to hear your question.
The main reason for my happiness is that you are creating bio-diversity.
Moreover, with biotechnology, you are well aware of the problems of farmers.
But it's not right to think it's happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the nature of all Indians and we are following the traditional way of burning the ruins of crops.
First of all, we didn't know about such losses.
Everyone does it, we do it.
Secondly, I didn't train how to do this.
But your concern is correct.
But these aren't real.
The ruins of the crop are precious.
Secondly, they burn the surface of the Earth.
We can't live if the heart is strong.
And the ruins of the harvest burn not only the ruins but the earth burns the skin of the mother.
Animals can also be utilised for their food, which saves our land.
Not only that, put the furnace on the same planet right there, it gives double profit.
Once I got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who have done vaccination.
They shared their best experiences.
Before they had cultivated the harvest, the hectares had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and ten thousand to remove the ruins of the harvest.
The ruins of the fountain will remain the same until people bring them to the tractor.
However, some farmers buried these ruins of the furnace into pieces of 6-8 inches.
Last time, I had discussions about organ donations in Mann Ki Baatti.
Helpline of 'Chathcha' for organ donation.
Filmmaker Ravina Tandon and other prominent personalities participated in this.
We can save many lives precious by organ donation.
In a way, the organ donates immortality.
When the organs change from one body to another, that organ gets a new life.
What's greater than this
A National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation for patients waiting for organ transplantation started on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awakening in every circumnavigation and in the true sense the best support for the needy.
Everyone has to come forward for this.
As I have mentioned earlier, December 3 is waiting for an international holiday.
Physically and mentally responsive are the owners of perfect will and courage.
They feel sad when they're ridiculed.
We'll start crying when it's a little difficult.
When we think about how they live, we feel the pain.
How do they live
Their determination, their way of embracing life, their zeal to empower the dangers, is commendable.
Today I want to talk about Javed Ahmad.
His age is 40, 42.
In 1996, the terrorists shot him in Kashmir.
Though he was a victim of the terrorists' gun, he was amazingly saved.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed and one part of the intestine was lost.
The spinal cord was severely damaged.
He lost his ability to stand on his own, but he didn't fail.
Terrorism's wound didn't defeat him.
How to revive physically responsibilities, what arrangements should be made in public and public offices.
Isn't Javed's life capable of inspiring every corner of India
I specially remember the life of Javed Ahmad, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
I am just talking about Javed because of lack of time, but in every corner of India, similar motivational lamps are rising.
Our country is too big.
There's a lot of government-based things going on here.
More than one experience changes our vision of government systems throughout life.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
Millions of people are working around us like this.
What's the joy of seeing patients with love
Are they participating in the comfort of society
I appreciate all the satisfactories of this kind of work in the name of 'Jamunami'.
Along with more discussions on 'e' books, one of the youngsters must tell the students of eight or nine or ten classes of nearby schools, what is happening here and there.
And, in fact, you are becoming a good teacher of a society.
I warmly welcome you to nation building activities.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change.
A friend who led me to share this incredible experience had sent me an ink to know and see it.
However, if they say something they did, there would be no such educationists.
They have been working with solar energy to bring light to the poor in their area.
They fought against darkness and made their name superb.
They built a plant of solar lit Rantal through a women's team.
They are paying a ransom of only 100 rupees per month to the local residents.
We know what big people in the world do about climate change.
Thank you very much for e News.
But the beginning is very good.
In a very short span of time, 66 lakh people have been able to get 40-2,000 crore rupees (Rs 42,000 crore) through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Whether it be a laundry or a journalist or a milkman, any labourer will get the real benefit of it.
Abhishek shared his happiness too.
There's a lot of things in front of me.
Another is Shailesh Bhoslah from Mumbai.
8. 5 lakh (8.
I used to say at the time of our Swachh Bharat programme that a new entrepreneurship is going to come in the middle of this scheme.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in bringing this to work.
But many people don't know enough about this.
How should the programme be created
How's the logo
But I'm expecting a lot of suggestions.
A lot of basic projects are needed.
Those who are active in this will also receive a certificate of honor.
And many other gifts have been announced.
My dear brothers, the month of winter has started.
Everybody should join us in exercising as a festival by creating a good environment in the family.
You will be able to identify with the festival of Exercise, how much a glimpse of Chaitanya is.
The whole body will be more active throughout the day.
If it's a good weather, it's a good habit.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to you.
Jai Hind.
For the first time on October 3 last year, I had the privilege of presenting Mann Ki Baat.
One year through Mann Ki Baat.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
I can tell from my experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme that this thought of our ancestors has great strength and truth because I realized it.
A lot of topics started coming from below to the government.
And it is true that it is the basic principle of governance that information should come down from the bottom to the bottom.
Did anyone ever think that Mann Ki Baat would be a source of knowledge
But it happened.
So Mann Ki Baat created an opportunity to express the strength of the empire.
The whole world was amazed when I said one day with selfie with daughter.
It was a silent revolution.
People from every nook and corner of India sent lakhs of pictures.
Perhaps the tourism departments of the Government of India or the States have not thought that we have so much wealth.
Mann Ki Baat became a platform and people took up the job without spending even a rupee for the government.
I was happy to mention Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme on October last year.
When I talked about Gandhi Jayanti, I asked the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, with the encouragement of Khadi products across the country.
There was a time called Khadi for the nation.
Shouldn't it be Khadi for fashion now, according to the change of time
I told the people you want to buy a merchandise and do something.
I am glad to say that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled.
This wasn't happening with government advertising.
Millions and crores of rupees have not been spent.
A feeling of the power of the people, a victory.
Once I told Mann Ki Bati, the poor smokes in his house, the children cry.
Shouldn't they get a gas cylinder
Today, I can say with great happiness that 30 lakh families of our country have abandoned the subsidy of LPG.
I have seen that a retired school teacher in the channel is staying in Customs to disqualify the discretionary female subsidiary.
It's difficult for the middlemen and the lower class to leave the subsidy.
But such people have abandoned the subsidy.
Isn't it silent
We can't see the power of the people in this.
Governments have to take lessons in what is happening within the framework of our government. Outside this framework, there is a massive, energetic and determined society.
What else do you want to be happy about this
I thought of doing a new experiment this time in Mann Ki Baat.
There will be no place where people do not have phone calls in India.
This is a comfortable experience.
People of all ages have sent a message.
I wanted to hear some messages myself and I liked it.
My team is taking action for the rest.
All the departments of the government will surely consider your instructions.
But one thing surprised me and enjoyed me.
Perhaps it seems we're ineffective.
But my experience is forgotten.
These fifty thousand people said their way.
How much more the common people of the country think about it, how much wealth is it for the country
Perhaps only one or two phone calls from the context of serious complaints.
More than 90 per cent of Indias energy consumption was a matter of great happiness.
They must be listening to the radio.
He sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
This is my message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. Please urge the people of India to use the highest standards for Diwali through Mann Ki Baat programme this time.
This will benefit the environment and create opportunities for thousands of renovative brothers to get employment.
I believe that your feelings like 'Pawan Acharya' will reach and propagate in the bottom of India.
I am talking to the countrymen, if we implement what Lord Acharya has said in the coming festivals, then the light will prove in their homes, but the light will spread in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army
With our forces that protect the ocean cargo.
The 1965 war with Pakistan completed 50 years.
It was named after an exhibition of 'Saurayanjali' at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to make history, it is essential to know and understand the microscopes of history.
History connects us to our roots.
If the relationship with history is lost, the possibility of building a history can also be fulfilled.
Don't hurry like me.
I'm back in two and a half hours.
That kid's right.
And I've heard the comments about what happened.
I didn't feel bad about it. Even in the good parliament I saw in it, discussions about India's cleanliness are going on.
On the other hand, on the other hand, the Parliament, on the other hand, a child of this country, on the other hand speaks of cleanliness, what is a greater good fortune for one country
This revolution of ideas is creating an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt and awareness about cleanliness.
This will force governments to work.
When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we should take up this task for the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi has said
If there is a time for cleanliness and freedom to choose one of these, then I will first choose cleanliness and then I will be free.
Gandhiji gave importance to cleanliness more than independence.
Gulshan Arra Mygov from Delhi.
In I want to know about Deen Dayal ji's birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, the lives of the great men are always inspiring us.
Our work is not to assess what the great men were followers of thought.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is an inspiration for us.
These days, there are occasions to remember many great men.
On September 25, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri on October 2, Jaiprakash Narayan on October 11 and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on October 31, I would like to mention a lot.
On 2nd October, I would like to make a special move.
Even if it benefits, it gives equal significance to Khadi.
Brothers and sisters with ghee are doing a lot of work.
The poor widow of Khadi will be brought home.
That's why this candle will surely be extinguished if one of you has a place in the houses of each other in the body.
Look, last time the sale has almost doubled.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy with one thing.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, Subhas Chandra Bose's supporters came to see me.
He was his son-in-law.
I have had the opportunity to play with Subhas Chandra Bose's family for a long time.
My name is Bhargavi.
I want to inform you that the younger generation should be aware of the registration of voters and in the coming days the participation of the younger generation will increase and in the future the participation of the younger generation will be greater in government elections and governance.
Thank you, Bhargavi said that the number of voters in the list and the voter turnout.
I would like to especially congratulate the Election Commission of India on this.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Electronics Commission had only acted as a regulator, but for the past few years it has changed considerably.
This is a very good change, but it doesn't matter if the Election Commission works only.
Generally, I want to say that polling should be done first day and water consumption.
One, a seven-year-old, Kshitij Pandey, is studying in the 7th class at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Banaras Hindu University.
I want our children to increase scientific and interest in our country.
Nine years old.
When she asked her father, she said she's been saying all this since she was 5.
I asked, where did you learn
So I wanted to share with you.
We're doing a lot of things that you see on TV and don't know from the newspapers.
My time has to be adjusted with it.
Friends in Akashwani have to wait for me for half an hour.
It's good for a month to launch.
Starting from Germany, the citizens of Hindustan were enlightened by the radio about the freedom movement.
The beginning of the Azad Hind Radio was through the horizontal news bulletin.
He also launched languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu.
I've finished one year by showing Mann Ki Baat through the sky.
We'll meet next month at Mann Ki Bati.
May your suggestions continue.
Your advice is beneficial for the government.
It starts a good change.
Your partnership is precious, invaluable.
I once again extend my best wishes.
English rendering of the text of PMs address on the 30th of August, 2015 at 11 a.m.
You have my greetings and I've got a chance to show you things in mind.
On this occasion, the entire nation celebrated me as a sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented new schemes for social security for the common man.
In a short span of time, all the dignitaries have taken up these projects.
I appealed to our sisters to execute safety programs in the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
I see it as a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, a year before I was talking to you, Jan Dhan scheme was made available to a large number of people.
The main thrust of the economy is in the banking sector and this ERPAT has set up a bank mission scheme to bring the poor.
Today, more than one lakh bank friends are operating throughout the country.
Youngsters have got jobs through this.
You will be happy to hear that within a year, about one lakh economic awareness camps have been conducted to connect the banking sector with the poor.
I've given you all these things, and now you have to continue with this relationship.
All our accounts must be efficient.
In the past few days, I had the opportunity to meet the students of the Sufi tradition.
Their voices, their textbooks, i.e., the liberality and harmony that is seen in the Sufi tradition, have the blueprints of music.
I have received an invitation to participate in it, and it is my pleasure to invite me to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
There will be a chance to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I want to tell you things in my mind again.
I have already mentioned about these issues.
You must have heard me in the parliament, you must have heard Mann Ki Baat in public meetings.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have nothing to fear.
I don't have any such opportunity.
We put an order in the middle.
Ordinance's term is due tomorrow on 31st August.
I've decided to finish the termination.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan, I would like to inspire you that this is not just a mudra but also a mantra for us.
I have another thing to say.
Two days ago, the war of 1965 completed 50 years.
Whenever I remembered this war in 1965, I remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
At the same time, he will be remembered as Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is natural to remember all the martyrs who have kept the Tricolour Platform of India and its importance and courage.
I salute all those associated with the war battlefield of 65.
Welcome to the warriors.
We have been inspired by these historical moments.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of Sufi tradition, I had the opportunity to interact with the country's leading scientists for hours and listen to their opinions.
I am extremely happy that India is performing well in various fields of science.
In fact, our scientists are doing great things.
How do we bring such research among the masses
How to use these principles on a practical level
I told the last Mann Ki Baat that we should lead our students to science.
I thought there were many opportunities and possibilities after this discussion.
I want to tell my dear young friends something special.
In the recent past, many guests from all over the world have come to India.
Why not connect our festivals with cleanliness
The beginning of the rain was good this year.
In our country, there is a queue of food grains, oilseeds and pulses.
Poor people need food grains and oil is essential for cooking vegetables.
However, this time crops provide a lot of happiness, with around 50 increase in food grains and 33 in oilseeds this year.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters.
My dear countrymen, July 26 has marked the Kargil victory in the history of our country.
The more the farmers of the country have relations with the land, the more they have relations with the army and the country.
In the Cargil war, each of our soldiers has brought hundreds of enemies.
India can speak in front of the world today as a result of all their collective sacrifices.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to our brave soldiers, who have succeeded in Kargil.
Smt. Sutrakhawacharya from Chennai has sent a number of instructions.
I believe you all send good instructions.
I want to make my point of view clear.
I don't want anyone to give any advice, but find ways to remove state governments, central governments or local governments from their responsibilities.
Two days ago, I noticed the scene of a vehicle accident in Delhi, and after 10 minutes of the accident, the scooter was on the way.
He didn't get any help.
Likewise, many people write to me more about these issues, you talk about road safety issues and make the common people aware.
May the Hoskot Niwas of Bangalore be Prasanka Kunj of Mudubidri in Karnataka - People are very much, I remember the names of all of them - their concerns were expressed in this regard.
Every minute of accident in our country is happening every day.
A death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The worst thing is that about three and a half of those who die, between 15 and 25, are young people, each death and every family is captured.
Another thing that I suddenly remember is that a small group of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh have touched my heart.
'Brother No. 1' means an excellent brother can give his sister a toilet on the day of Rakshabandhan.
All such brothers should be encouraged to make toilets for their sisters, so that mothers and sisters in the entire district do not have to undergo excretion.
Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh is a small village of workers.
The people of that village have started and completed the mission to build toilets for the past few months.
Now no one has to evacuate cataract in that village.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me about the problems of the North-Eastern states from Gohati.
It has also decided to organize seven days camps in the states of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim and a team of Central Government officials will go to the North Eastern States.
The results of this effort will come in the coming days.
It's a matter of great concern that there's nothing to do with science.
In a way, science and technology are the aims of development.
Our IAS officers have learnt a lot of things and they must sometimes interact with children in school or college around 2-4 hours a week, their experiences are their strength.
In the coming years, our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
The children of the village should not be disturbed when they are studying on the exam day.
If we want to start small and big industries in villages then we need electricity.
Today, if they want to charge mobile, go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should be available to the villages.
For that, Deendayal Upadhyaya Grameen Yojana started.
I want to talk about every Indian in today's Mann Ki Baat.
Similarly, the months of August and September are the days of celebration.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
In the midst of the needy, I heard a lot of things about the 130 crore people in a vibrant atmosphere as they were talking to the family.
Sometimes it becomes a motivation for the needy.
I just used my words, but I didn't think I wasn't.
I felt a fool.
Anyway, the last chance has come.
In a family, Mann Ki Baat, small and small things.
In a way, let us continue this programme by giving birth to a new Ojjas, which has caused change in society and life.
A lot of messages have come in the past months and people have said that there is no Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes I feel that this is my journey from swam to empire.
This is the journey from I to Nami.
My interaction with you for me was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Several people asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
I had the opportunity to meet me for my sake.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes it becomes a source of inspiration for my thought process and sometimes it becomes a source of inspiration for others.
When people put forward the challenges of the country and the society, they suggest solutions.
People in the letters explain the problems, and say peace and some suggestions, some imagination, some obvious or obscure.
That is, in a way, I can feel in your words a sign of how peace and harmony can be achieved with the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of soul, strength and ability in the people.
We have to unite those strengths and those achievements, give them a chance, they have to be implemented.
Mann Ki Baat says that 130 crore people want to join together in the progress of the country in a strong and active manner.
You can imagine how much energy I get when I am hungry about these things.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, we can continue with Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, not for the country, that election was not for self-reliance, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps, in a country of the world, the people there would not have voted for democracy alone, regardless of their remaining rights, powers and requirements.
The country saw such an election in 1977.
Over 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, we feel that this number is normal.
However, in comparison to the world's population, more people than any other country have voted in India than China.
The number of people who voted in 2019 is more than the total population of America, almost doubled.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
It opens the vastness and vastness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the largest democratic election in the world.
You can imagine what kind of resources and manpower were required to hold such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and other functionaries were required to conduct this election because of chemistry.
Nearly 3 lakh members of the Armed Forces were responsible for successfully carrying out this mission of democracy and 20 lakh police personnel from different states performed the duties and worked hard.
Their hard work has resulted in more people voting this time than ever before.
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh developed machines have been provided for voting.
You can imagine how long it's ready.
No voter can use his vote, so that he did all this.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only a Polling Station has been set up for a woman voter.
You will be surprised to hear that the electorate had to travel for two days to reach there.
This is to honour democracy in the right way.
The highest Polling station in the world is also in India .
The Polling Station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahole Spiti, Himachal Pradesh.
In this election, the voting percentage of women and men was almost equal.
Another fact is that this time there are 78 women members in the Parliament who have lost their history.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the turnout programme and salute the vigilant voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of me saying, "Boke no book".
I said use a book instead of flowers to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books everywhere.
In his stories, the entire spirit of India is incorporated.
When he read the story of Nasha (Lahari), my mind turned to the economic inequality spread in the society.
I remember the days I was young.
It has come to mind how discussions were held all night in this regard.
If you don't remember that the son of Jammu, Ishwari and Bir of the poor family cannot learn from this story, then you will not understand when the impact of bad guys is on.
A child with sensitivity has lost his love for his grandmother, the feeling that he's cooked at his young age.
We can see the real humane sensitivity reaching the Paramaya by buying from the 4-5-year-old Hamid Festival, a harvest that can be used from the Chapatti shore.
I'm glad that the farmer, Haldu, will not have to sleep in the field in the extreme cold.
Even though these stories are about a hundred years ago, we will feel the same.
K.
Muralidhara is also doing a little tea dress.
Today this library shows a way for everyone, including the tribal children.
The popularity of Gujarat in the name of 'Vanche Gujarat' was a successful test.
Millions of people in all ages participated in this initiative to read books.
In today's digital world, I want to find some time to request you and me on the occasion of Google Guru's birth and give you books some time between your daily routine.
Please write about the book 'Narendramodi App' and let all the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country think of a challenge not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov... seeing a lot of people writing about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Balgavi and Sithamshu Prayer of Bhubaneswar, many others including Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf have written to me about the challenges related to water.
Water has great importance in our culture.
You bless your mother's satisfaction... and the wrath is on us.
Water scarcity affects various parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available by rains throughout the year.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
With the participation of people like other problems, with the strength of the people, with the ability and co-operation and determination of one crore and thirty million people, we will find peace in this problem.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has been set up in the country with utmost importance for water.
With this, all water related issues can be decided.
A few days ago I decided to do something different.
I wrote letters to the villagers of the country.
I wrote that in order to save water, to save water and not to lose every rain, the people of the village called for a meeting and thought of the villagers.
I am glad that they have done this and have made efforts in thousands of panchayats on the 22nd of this month.
The people of the villages have resolved to conserve every water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to the message given to all of us by the villagers of Lupung Panchayat in Katakmandi Block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand: "My name is Guru Ravidas. We did not believe that when the Prime Minister wrote a letter to us for water conservation, we have written such a letter.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the village heads and all the village heads for their enthusiasm.
The people of the village now feel that they are competing to build a temple for water in their village.
As I said, socio-economic efforts can make positive changes.
The country cannot afford any trick to meet the problem of water.
Several aspects are being tried in different ways.
But the goal of everyone is to keep water and water supply.
Drainage lines are being repaired in Punjab.
This effort will save us from the problem of floods.
The construction of tanks in Timmai Cantt in Telangana has changed the lives of rural people.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, small ponds made in the field of agriculture have become a big change.
I read about a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women gathered to revive the river Nag.
She also read about the women in Gwalior who worked very well in collaboration with each other for rain water supply.
I am confident that if you make a strong effort, you can make it impossible.
When people gather, water will be kept.
I say that the water is touching, and the touch of the water will create a new life.
A water conservation campaign can be organized to protect every drop of water.
In this, we can talk about water related problems and also promote water conservation.
I specially urge people from different walks of life to make different campaigns for water conservation.
Everyone in the field of films, sports, media, friends, social organizations, people associated with cultural organisations, stories and narratives should lead this publicity in their own way.
Let's wake up society, unite society, join society.
Look, we can see a change in our eyes.
I urge you all to share your knowledge about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the chance to go to Porbandar, the birthplace of a venerable father, there should be another house behind his father's house where there is a 200-year-old water storage, which still has water.
There's an arrangement for stopping rain water.
I always say that those going to Kirti Mandir must see that water storage.
There must be a variety of reservoirs in many places.
You will also be able to share your share with the Hash Tag.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you for one more thing and thank the people of the world.
Everyone, if the sun rises on every corner of the world, those who love Yoga welcome the sun, then it is a journey till the sun sets.
Throughout the world, the Prime Ministers, the renowned people and the common people have shown how they celebrated Yoga in their own country.
That day the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive people need to build a healthy society.
Therefore, propagating Yoga is an important matter related to social service.
That kind of service should be accepted and it should be respected
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Ministers Award for the greatest participants in promoting and promoting Yoga in 2019.
You cannot imagine how important they have played in promoting Yoga.
Japan Yoga Niketan is conducting several institutes and training courses there.
Miss in Italy.
We have very inspiring examples.
Is it a matter related to Yoga, but can Indians stand behind it
Behar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger has also been honoured and they have worked with dedication to Yoga for the past decade.
Likewise, he also honoured Swami Rajarshi Muni and established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes, yes.
I'll wait for your instructions.
It is a great journey for me to join your thoughts, and that is Mann Ki Baat.
Come on, let's be together, share ideas.
I'll hear what you have in your mind, keep it safe, let's understand.
Sometimes I can try to live with your feelings.
You must be blessed.
You're my inspiration, you're my energy.
Come together, share the happiness of Mann Ki Baat and fulfil the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
(See: 53rd Summit) Dear Countrymen.
These brave heroes sacrificed their lives for hundred and fifty crore Indians.
Our brave sons kept watching the night to sleep peacefully.
At the same time, the invaders were answered in their own language.
You must have seen how the attack took action within 100 hours.
The army is determined to root out terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, we have been able to see an exciting response from their families through the mediums, which is encouraging the entire nation.
The emotions expressed at the time of his sorrow, the father of the brave-hearted Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar are inspiring for all of us.
The nation salutes the brave courage of the martyr Prasanna Saheb of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
The only son of his own has been sworn in by CRPF.
The same feeling is seen in every house of our brave and courageous martyrs.
I want to tell the youth that the feelings expressed by these families, their minds should be understood and tried to understand.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, we are witnessing the war memorial that we have waited for in this long period of independence.
It is natural for people to have curiosity and curiosity in this regard.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has expressed happiness that the National War Memorial will be concluded by Shri Omkar Shetty from the dress in Karnataka in April.
I was surprised and pained that there was no such time in the National War Memorial in India.
We needed a war memorial to commemorate the legends of our brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to have such a memorial.
I am happy that the decision to build a National War Memorial is being completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on February 25, we will deliver this National Military Memorial to our forces.
The country will make a small attempt to borrow.
This new memorial is built near the heart of Delhi, i. e.
I believe that our people going to this National Military Memorial will be equal to going to a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation towards the great martyrs after Independence.
The design of the memorial shows great courage to our immortal soldiers.
The National Soldiers Memorial has been designed in three circles, including the journey from birth to martyrdom of each soldier.
The jewellery of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
The second chapter shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This circle shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the greatest martyrs of the country have been recorded in golden qualities.
Thereafter, it's a protective cycle, which shows security.
I'll see a row of dense trees in this tree.
I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation in October last year.
It was also a reflection of the idea that the country should be grateful to the men and women police who are constantly undermining our security.
I am sure you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share the pictures taken from there in the social media that may be inspired by others, they may be happy to see these memorials in this holy place.
My dear countrymen, I have received thousands of letters and comments for Mann Ki Baat through a number of media.
The birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on March 3.
Two individuals from different families who have enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baat is like commemorating the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities are not only Jharkhand but also the entire nation.
People are grateful for their contribution to the entire nation.
Do you know why the English were so terrible
Because even the British who built such a great empire were afraid of him.
Birsa was used by his traditional arrows and villa to capture the British rule that used guns and cannons.
Birsa was not only fighting the British for dramatic freedom, but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his short life.
He illuminated the sun in the dark life of the deprived and exploited.
He sacrificed his life at the age of 25.
The brave sons of Bharatamba like Birsa Munda have been present in all parts of the country.
In this centuries-long freedom struggle, there will not be any corner of India and India.
If the personalities like Birsa Munda make us aware of our inequality, personalities like Jamshedji Tata have conferred great institutions for the country.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies, but it must be an industrial centre.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, called the Indian Institute of Science, was a result of his long vision.
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jemshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda are on the ship in the middle of their journey to America.
It is said that this discussion has been decided to establish the Indian Institute of Science.
Dear countrymen, the birth of our country's former Prime Minister Mr. Morarjibhai was on February 29.
As you all know, this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai, the owner of a calm and calm personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai has the privilege of presenting the budget for the highest time in the Parliament of Free India.
He had to pay for it in the old age.
The government arrested him and imprisoned him.
He became the Prime Minister of the country when he won the Janata Party elections in 1977.
The 44th Amendment provides for the publication of proceedings in the Parliament and in the Lok Sabha.
Some of the powers of the Supreme Court were reinstated by this Amendment, which added that the fundamental rights obtained through Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be repealed in due course.
The Cabinet also provided that the President can declare a state of emergency and that the climate period cannot exceed six months.
In 1975, Morarjibhai ensured that he would not return to the future by announcing the situation and killing democracy.
He will recall his great contribution to maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to the great leader.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every year, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people about Padma awards.
They bring positive change in the lives of others in different ways through their own emotions.
It was a great deal to bring a rare painting to the new surface.
I conveyed to the former President of America, Barak Thailand, the art work of Abdul Ghafoor.
Among those who received the Padma awards are the servants of Shabir Said Gomata at Marathwada.
You will be surprised to hear about Tao Porchon-ynch in America, and Linch is now a big institution for Yoga.
My dear countrymen, 12 of the awardees of Padma awards this year are the most important farmers.
Normally, a few people associated with farming have come to the list of Padma Shri.
It is a living picture of India that is changing today.
My dear countrymen, today I am going to tell you something brilliant.
Brothers and sisters, nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefited from this scheme in the last five months.
I saw how big it was bringing about in the lives of the poor.
If you knew someone who wasn't filthy for treatment because of lack of money, tell them about this plan.
My dear countrymen, this scheme is for such a poor person, who is going to start exams in schools.
In the next few weeks, examinations of various education boards, cyclones and twelfth grade will start in the country.
I heartily convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and all the teachers for writing the exams.
A few days ago, a big programme was organised at Town Hall in Delhi.
In this Town Hall, I have been able to talk to millions of students and parents and teachers across the country with the help of technology.
Through the radio, I talk to millions of families in a way every month.
Often, when you talk to you, when you read your letters, I think you are part of my family while listening to your comments on the phone.
It gives me a feeling of comfort.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festival of democracy.
Mann Ki Baat has been telling you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to you all.
Mann Ki Baat 2019 January
The nation received a very sad news on the 21st of this month.
Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji became Diwangt, Dr. Siddhganga Math, Tumkur district of Karnataka.
Shivakumaraswamy dedicated his life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us - Kayakave Kailas, that is, to work hard and to work hard, is equal to being in Kailas, the residence of Lord Shiva.
Shivakumar Swamiji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social and educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people in his 111-year career.
He was an eminent scholar in English, culture and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He tried his best to provide food, housing, education, spiritual knowledge to the people.
His priorities were good for the farmers.
The Siddhganga monastery was ordinarily organising livestock fairs.
I have often been fortunate to receive the blessings of the revered Swamiji.
On this occasion, Kalam Saheb gave a poem about the revered Swamiji.
Once again, I pay my homage to that greatness.
My dear countrymen, on January 26, 1950, the Constitution was laid in our country.
In those days, our country is for the Republic.
Yesterday we celebrated Republic Day.
But I want to tell you something else.
25th January was the foundation day of the Election Commission and this day is celebrated as National Voters Day.
People from all over the world are surprised to see the huge electoral process in India.
It is natural for the citizens of our country to feel proud of the Election Commission.
He must have heard that there is a polling booth for only one voter in the Geer forest of Gujarat.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission, which is constantly working to strengthen our democracy.
Congratulations to the Election Commission and the Security Officers and other officers of all the States for ensuring a free and sustainable election, which is part of the voting process.
This year our country will have Lok Sabha elections.
This will be the first time that youngsters born in the 20th century will exercise their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to get the responsibility of the country.
They are going to decide the brotherhood of the country.
It's time to combine your dreams with the dreams of the nation.
I appeal to the younger generation to register as a voter if it is the age of voting.
And we have to think that it is our duty to vote.
If there is no reason to vote for any reason in life, it must be painful.
I'm sorry to see something wrong happens in the country.
Our country is a great saint.
One of those great personalities was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
In Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who played their role in India's independence.
Since independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings were closed till today.
These locked rooms in the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum today, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Every stone of this museum is full of aroma of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum, the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle inspire us to go to history.
At the same place, the British Government had filed a case against the brave sons of Bharatamba, Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gurbaksh Dhilan and Major General Shanawas Khan.
I have put the hat in the museum itself and let the visitors visit the hat and inspire the patriots.
Anyway, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders have to continue in different ways to the new generation again.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
75 years ago, as a part of a programme on the Tricolour Flag, I raised the Tricolour Platform.
Similarly, everybody would be surprised to raise the tri-flag in the Red Fort in October 2018, because there is always a flag hoisting on August 15.
Now the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Azad Hind Government was celebrated.
Dilli Chalo, Tum Mummy Khoon Do, Mim Tummy Azad Dumga (Go to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom).
There has been a need for public viewing of files related to Netaji for the past several years.
I'm glad I could do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's family came together in the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop a number of places related to the great people of India in Delhi.
26 Alipur Road connected with Baba Saheb Ambedkar and Sardar Patel Museum and Kranti Mandir.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
He also chose the radio to interact with the people, and in 1942, Subhas Babu started the Azad Hind Radio.
I understand that this radio station has been launching news bullets every week, which was in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu.
The radio station is being run by Gujarati M.
Who.
Vyas played a great role.
The ordinary people liked the programmes launched at the Azad Hind Radio.
Those programmes were very encouraging to the warriors who had entered the freedom struggle.
A visual museum is also organised in this Kranti temple.
He has tried to explain Indian art and culture in a very attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, where there are more than 450 paintings and other art forms of three centuries old.
The Museum demonstrates the excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avinindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy and Silos Mukherjee.
I urge you all to go there and definitely keep the writings of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You must be wondering why when I talk about art, why do you say that Gurudev Tagore's greatest scriptures
Perhaps you have ever known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds, drawn numerous natural scenes, and in addition, he has imbibed human nature and art in canvas.
It is important to say that Gurudev has not given his names to many of his writings.
He used to think that those who see the paintings, should understand the painting themselves, so that the message he has given through his own perspective.
His pictures have been displayed in European countries and in Russia and America.
Our great minds have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
It was such a great soul, Saint Chidambaram.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Rabindra Das.
Saint Ravidas ji's tales are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the sacred land of Varanasi.
Through his message, he tried to convince the glory of all his life, of those who are blind and humble.
Our space programme contributes to several young scientists of the country in the space programme.
Today, we are proud that our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets.
The art of our students was launched on January 24.
New records have also been set up by students in Odisha.
Space missions have been launched in the last four years since independence to 2014.
We have established the world record of launching 104 satellites through the same atmosphere.
We are going to ensure India's presence on Chandrayaan 2 soon.
Our country is using space technology to save lives and lives of people.
Be it climate change, railways, road safety, space technology is very helpful in all.
Naval instruments have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which is helpful in economic development along with their safety.
We use space technologies to bring government services to the people and to determine its responsibility effectively.
Under the Housing for All, about 40 lakh houses have been tagged in 23 states under the Housing for All.
Moreover, about three and a half million earthquakes have been tagged under Manrega.
Our satellites are the symbols of the growing power of the country today.
Today, through our competitive satellite launch service, India is launching satellites of not only developed countries but also developed countries.
Children are attractive to the sky and stars.
Our space programmes provide an opportunity to children to think a lot and go beyond the limits that we thought it impossible today.
It is also a vision to observe stars for our children and inspire them to find new stars.
In January, 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games in the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
This time players from all the states in Khelo India performed well in their own way.
Life is a strong inspiration for many medal winners.
In wrestling, the young player, Akash Gorkha silver medal, I read that Akshay's father, Akshay ji, works as a guardian in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Sonali Halevi, the captain of 21 women cabdi teams in Maharashtra, lives in Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age, and brother and mother encouraged Sonali's talent.
It is usually seen that girls do not get such encouragement in playing games like Kabbadi.
Yet Sonali chose the tribes and showed the best performance.
Abhinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Assam, is one of the youngest gold medals in the Khelo India Youth Games.
The daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, Akshata Baswanikamati, received a gold medal in Bharathwad.
When we talk about the creation of India, we must remember that youth power is the vision of New India.
While telling these stories of Khelo India, we must remember that New India is not only the contribution of people in big cities, but also the contribution of youngsters and children from small towns and villages and young sports persons.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about the beauty of your name.
But have you heard of a pretty contest
More than fifty thousand toilets have participated in this strange contest that has been going on for nearly a month.
I urge all the Sarpanches and rural heads to lead this movement in their Panchayats.
You must share the picture of your Swachh Survekshan with Mylathar in Hindi media.
Friends, on 2nd October 2014, we started a memorable journey to make the country free of dirt and to avoid waste in the open space.
My little friends, the days of the exam are coming closer.
Himachal Pradesh resident Amsul Sharma MyGov has written that I want to talk about exams and exam warriors.
Thank you for taking care of this matter.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the test season.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss this issue, but on 29th January, at 11 a.m. on 29th January, we will talk to students from all over the country along with students and parents and teachers from all over the country.
This time students from other countries are also participating in this programme.
I will talk to young friends about all aspects related to exams, particularly stress free exams in this exam paper discussion.
Some of these suggestions and suggestions will surely be presented to you in the Town Hall programme.
You must join this program.
You will be able to telecast this through social media or Namo App Ludyo.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is the day of revered Bapu.
On 11th, the country will pay tributes to martyrs across the country.
We must pay homage to the two minute guardians everywhere.
Remembering the revered Bapu, fulfilling his dreams, building a New India, performing his duties as citizens.
This journey of 2019 will be successfully taken forward.
Greetings to all of you, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
Dear countrymen, Namaskar.
2018 is going to end.
We are entering 2019.
Let us naturally listen to the discussions about the years to come with discussions over the past year.
Whether it is the life of the individual or of the society or of the life of the nation, everyone has to turn around and try as much as possible.
This is the result of the achievements of experiences and the new self-confidence of doing something.
What kind of contribution we can contribute to bringing about changes in our lives and taking the country and the society forward.
Many good wishes to you all in 2019.
As a result of the resolve of the people of the country, the values of cleanliness have gone up by 95 percent.
For the first time since independence, the Azad Hind Government has raised the Tricolour on the 75th Anniversary of the Red Fort.
The Champions of the Earth awarded the highest ecosystem of the United Nations in the country.
Indias efforts towards solar energy and climate change have been recognized globally.
International Solar Alliance (ISA) was the first great event of the International Solar Alliance in India.
Our country has unprecedented excellence in the Ease of Doing Business Rankings.
Our girls have enhanced the pride of the country by nurturing the world through navigation.
The country's first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
Bogibeel Bridge, the longest rail-road bridge in the country, was dedicated to the nation, and the first and centenary airport in Sikkim was inaugurated at Pakyong.
India was successful in the 19th century World Cup and the Blind City World Cup.
This time, India has won many medals in the Asian Games.
India has performed very well in Para Asian Games.
Our Mann Ki Baat 2019 Level will be extended if the list of all the Indian social efforts begins.
This has been possible due to the uninterrupted efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey of Indias height and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will be able to scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, we have lost some of our distinguished people in December.
Dr. Jaichandran was known as one of the cheapest treatment available to the poor.
Likewise, on December 25, Sulagiti Narasamma of Karnataka was killed.
Sulagiti Narasamma was helping delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
They provided services to thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, particularly in Dargah areas.
There are many inspiring people like Jaichandra and Sulagiti Narasam.
They have dedicated their lives to the good of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, we also want to talk about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Some of the party workers told me that some young doctors in the city were conducting camps and treating the poor.
There are medical camps every month at the heart lungs cranial center where there is a provision for free diagnosis and treatment for many diseases.
Today, hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
This selfless service will certainly be appreciated by the enthusiasm of friends.
Today I can proudly say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been a successful campaign only through social efforts.
A few days ago, some people had told me that more than 3 lakh people gathered in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh were engaged in cleaning operations.
City Corporation, Services Organizations, School College Students and the entire population of Jabalpur participated excitedly in this campaign for cleanliness.
I'm thebetterindia.
Whenever I get a chance, I'm sure to go to the bitterindia.com and try to know about such inspirations.
I am glad that many such websites introduce us to many stories that inspire people with special characteristics.
Com is trying to promote positivity and make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, the story of yourstory. com young innovators and the success of the business community tells us a lot.
Please join the possibilities.
I am confident that more and more people will know about our heroes who bring about changes in the society.
It's very easy to spread negatives.
But we have very good things in our society, this is possible through the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
He's 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanna Advanced and impressed upon her, she learnt about her various positions, she proved herself talented.
I wish them a bright future for all the countrymen.
I wish Hannaka very good luck and blessings.
Likewise, a 16-year-old boy and Rajini had a lot of discussions on the media.
You must have read.
Rajni Junior Mahila wrestling received gold medal at Championship.
Immediately after winning the Rajni Medal, the child went to a nearby milk shop and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni Medal wrapped in a cloth and placed it in a bag.
You think why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The kid did it, honouring Jasmersing, who sells luxury at a stall in Panif.
Rajni said that his father suffered a lot of hardships in bringing him to this floor.
Jasmer Singh is going to work every morning before Rajani and his brothers wake up.
When he informed his father that he wanted to learn Rajni Boxing, he organised all possible things and encouraged his daughter's enthusiasm.
Rajnik wrestling training was required to carry out the old gloves, because at that time the family's financial condition was very bad.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni didn't get excited, had to learn wrestling.
A medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni in Pune has become one of the fastest growing people in the world.
The child traveled 300 kilometers a day on a bike for 159 days.
The zeal of the child is certainly congratulations for roaming in a bike.
We don't get inspired by this kind of achievement.
Many good wishes to our Annadata farmers brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of emotions such as unity in diversity and Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is filled in our festivals.
In Indian culture, there is no difference between society and nature, where the individual and the whole world is the same.
Calendar, Panchamgam based on festivals is a good example of our close relationship with nature.
It will be aware of the planets and the stars and the planets with festivals throughout the year.
It's decided according to which calendar you appreciate.
Festivals and festivals are celebrated in many areas based on the planets.
Gudi Padwa, Chattichand and Ugadi are all celebrated as Chandra Calendar, while Tamil Putan, Vishnu, Vaishakhi, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh and Bihu celebrate these festivals on the basis of the sunrise.
In our festivals, the feeling of waiting for rivers and water is particularly inclusive.
Chhath festival is related to sunrise in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people are drowning in the rivers of the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have an archaeological significance, on the other hand, all festivals inspire us to live in harmony with each other.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for 2019, and wish you a very heartfelt celebration of the upcoming festivals.
He must have heard about the Kumbh festival.
People from all over the country come and participate in the Kumbh festival.
The Kumbh Mela is a mass movement of faith and devotion.
Together, millions of people from within and outside the country gather here.
The legacy of the Kumbh Mela is blessed with our great cultural heritage.
Perhaps you will be eagerly waiting for the world famous Kumbh Mela celebrated in Prayagraj from January 15 this year.
The Kumbh Mela has already begun to reach the Saint-Mahatmal.
It is a great proof that the UNESCO International Heritage of Humanity has joined the list of global importance.
A few days ago, Ambassadors from several countries saw preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
There, the people of many countries have raised the nation.
The Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj is being held by people from over 150 countries.
This is a great study study, particularly for the youth.
I went to Prayag Raj a few days ago and saw preparations for the Kumbh festival enthusiastically.
This time, we are giving a lot of importance to cleanliness.
In operation, there will be cleanliness with the devotees and the message will reach far away.
This time devotees can also visit Akshayvad after sacred bath at Sangam.
The symbol of the faith of the people had been shut down in the fort for hundreds of years, so the devotees could not see it even if they wish.
This time everyone has been allowed to enter.
You must also participate in the Kumbh Mela and share the pictures of various heads in the social media so that more and more people can get inspiration to visit Kumbh Mela.
May the spiritual Kumbh Mela be a glory of Indian philosophy.
May the Kumbh Mela of faith be the glory of nationalism.
May the Kumbh festival of art and creativity be great.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the minds of the people on the occasion of Republic Day celebrations on 26th January and on that day we remember the great personalities of our Constitution.
This year, we are celebrating the centenary year of the revered Bapu.
President of South Africa Mr.
Siril Ramaphosa will be the Chief Guest on Republic Day this year.
There was an unparalleled relationship between the revered Bapu and South Africa.
The great soul was from this Dakshin Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa with strong opposition to writing.
He founded the Phoenix and Tolstoy farms, where there was a confrontation of peace and justice all over the world.
He had the power and inspiration to stay in prison for so many years.
Writing about Mandela Bapu, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because it is here that he started testing of truth.
This is where he showed his strong support for justice, where he raised the philosophy of Satyagraha.
He saw Bapu as a role model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only inspiring the entire world, but their ideals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a conference of DGPs was held at Kavadia on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat where the Statue of Unity is the highest statue in the world.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the nation.
He always kept alive in maintaining the integrity of India.
Sardar Saheb believed that India's strength depends on its diversity.
I salute Sardar Sab's feelings and pay my homage to him through this award for unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
His workplace was North India for a long time, and he was shot at Namded in Maharashtra.
In the birthplace, Karmabhoomi, North India, the last minute of life in Namded.
In a way, he received his blessings throughout the year.
After Guru Tej Bahadur ji became a martyr, Guru Gobind Singh ji won the position of Guru at the age of 9.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji had the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a peaceful and lazy personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice at length for the poor and the weak, he said.
He was a philosopher of valour, courage, sacrifice and patience.
He had an absurd weaponry and scientific knowledge.
Gurumukhi, Brajbhas, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi, Urdu and other languages were also known as the warrior.
I once again salute Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, many good events take place in the country, but there is no detailed discussion about them.
The country is also organising healthcare programmes as part of the Right India initiative.
This programme will be held by 27th January.
It is a matter of satisfaction that I am trying to get people awake and inform about it.
India will be prosperous when it is clean.
The most important thing for good health is nutrition.
To start this thing.
It is important to learn from childhood the lessons about the importance of food.
Come, let's move forward to achieve new heights, move forward, change yourself and change the country.
In MyGov, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, from Delhi, and from Amar Kumar, and from Patna, had asked about the same question as Monica Jane from Delhi in April, the Presidency Government from Bardwan, West Bengal, and the musician from Nagpur.
They say that people are usually connected with you through modern technology, social media and mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It happened in 1998.
I was working in Himachal as an organiser of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
May was.
It was a little Daba.
I don't understand anything.
Look, sir, listen to the radio.
Next morning, Akashwani had done a survey of Manki Baat.
Some of these reactions are very interesting.
Approximately 70 of the surveyed people are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has grown positive thinking in the society.
Many people have been encouraged by Mann Kiba.
Extensive discussions on Indiapositive were held.
I am happy to see that the radio becomes more popular due to Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets a mike, millions and millions of people listen to it, then what do you want
Finding out that there's no politics in this program.
When Mann Ki Baat started, it was decided that there should not be any politics in it, it should not be the benefits of the government, it should not be Modi.
You were the one who got the most motivation to implement this decision.
The short stories of 130 crore people will always exist.
This country will be able to scale new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When I read the letter, a feeling like that makes me feel like it.
In two words, I share it with you with my experience.
When will a government be able to inspire the country and abroad, starting the Selfie with Doter programme in a small village in Haryana
All sections of the society, known as celebrities, have joined this together and have awakened the thinking of the society in a new language that has been understood by the generations.
Mann Kibat is not about the government, it is about the society.
Manki Baat is a matter of progress.
India's pranayama is not politics, nor royal power.
India's eternal socio-economy is social power.
There are thousands of heads in social life, one of them is political.
If everything becomes political, it's not a good arrangement for the society.
Sometimes political events and political activists, the other talents of the society, and their talents of life, are suppressed.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy job for me.
People's letters are coming before every Mann Ki Baat.
Before Mann Ki Baat, I try to see the maximum number of letters and read the comments.
I hear a lot of phone calls.
As soon as Mann Kiba's episode approaches, I read your ideas and inputs very carefully during the journey.
So whenever you read a letter, the environment of the writer, his feelings, become part of my thoughts.
That letter is not just a paper piece for me.
I have guided the lives of an individual who has spent 40-45 years in almost every district of the country and spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
Efforts are being made to keep in mind the relevant departments of the letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to thank my friends from Akashwani, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels, Hindi media etc.
Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people because of their efforts.
The Akashvani team prepares to launch all the episodes in many languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat in the same voice in local language as Modi's voice.
They're going to be Modi for 30 minutes.
Congratulations and thanks to their talent and skills.
I urge you to listen to this program in local language.
In their channels, Mann Ki Baat wishes to be grateful to the friends of the media who are listening exactly every month.
A person in politics is not happy with the media, but he feels that it is only a bit of coverage and it is a negative coverage if he gets the coverage.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'm doing it in every family.
It's easier to understand things if we don't get through the old barriers of our own life.
I don't understand that a man has abandoned his thoughts and accepted Aparan's thoughts.
The specialty of today's youngsters is that they don't believe in themselves, if they believe in something, then they leave everything behind it.
Sometimes people talk about the interaction between families and youth.
In fact, it is very limited to talking to young people in most families.
It is said that don't do that about things that learn long, or about habits and lifestyles.
Through many programmes, I have been trying to talk continuously to the youth through social media.
I try to learn from them what they do, what they think.
They always have ideas.
They are very powerful and concentrating on new discoveries.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to make the problems and problems of the youth more connected.
Often young people are complaining of more questions.
I'm saying that the youngsters are asking questions.
We feel that today's youth is very important and thinks very big.
This is a New India, a New India.
Some say the youngsters want to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking what's wrong with this.
Many things do at the same time because they're capable of doing multi-tasking.
If we drive around the world, it is the youth who brings about big changes in the society, whether it is social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other region.
Young people who dare ask questions and dream new dreams.
If the youth bring their thoughts to the ground, give them an open environment to express it, they can bring about progressive changes in the country and they do so.
My dear countrymen, Vineetaji of Gurugram has written in MyGov that in this Mann Ki Baat I should tell about the Constitution Day.
It is a hearsay that the day is great because we are entering the 70th year of our constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
In order to fulfil this historic task, the Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days.
Just imagine that within three years, this greatness has given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
Today's timing is an example of management and productivity. They have created a government structure at such a rapid pace.
This will inspire us to fulfil our responsibilities in the record time.
The Constitution Construction Church was a confluence of the great personalities of the country and all of them were committed to the Constitution of India which empowers India and empowers the poorest of the poor.
When India completed 60 years of its Republic in 2010, a bright tour was organised in Gujarat by forming an elephant Constitution.
It was an opportunity to remind the youth of awakening the Constitution and connecting them with the various heads of the Constitution.
In 2020, we will complete 70 years as a Republic and will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us take forward our constitutional values and ensure peace and progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that even though Indians are different, we must be the nation beyond all.
India First India is Dr.
It is proposed to celebrate this opportunity in all State Governments and Union Territories.
This will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
Along with this, a train will run on the way to the holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
I remember the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb when I participated in this meeting.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, the Gurudwara suffered a lot.
Our journey will continue.
The more we connect with you, the more our journey will be deeper, the more it will bring happiness to everyone.
Sometimes there's a question in somebody's mind - what have I got in Mann Ki Baat
Your great desires are my greatest wishes...
Come on, let's go further through this journey.
31 October is the victory of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Like every year, the youth of the country are ready to run for the country's unity.
The weather is too comfortable now.
I urge you all to participate in the formal unity with enthusiasm.
About six and a half months before the Independence Day, the world's most famous international renowned 'The Time' magazine became a picture of Sardar Patel on the cover page of Lakka on January 27, 1947.
They had given a picture of India along with the key articles, which we did not see today.
It was a painting of India that had been scattered in different parts.
There were more than 550 nations at that time.
The English had no interest in India.
In the 1920s, he said how rescue operations were carried out during the floods in Ahmedabad.
It is said how Bardoli gave the spirit of Satyagraha.
His faith and commitment to the nation was fit to trust him from the farmers and workers to the industrialists.
On 31st October, the victory of Sardar Patel will be greater and the Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation by paying real attention to Sardar Patel.
The height of this statue situated on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double the statute of Liberty in America .
This is the world's highest, skyscraping idol.
Every Indian can be proud of the tallest statue in the world in India.
Sardar Patel, who is connected with the soil, will be decorated with the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we celebrated Infantry Day.
I salute all the people of India.
I salute the soldiers' families for their courage.
But do you know why we, the people of Hindustan celebrate Infantry Day
This was the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army came to the land of Kashmir and slaughtered Kashmir.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an interview with Sam Manek Shah, the great military officer of India.
In that interview, Field Marshal Manekshah is talking about the period he was in the field market.
At that time, in October 1947, there was a military invasion of Kashmir.
31st October is the day of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Indira will be respected and careful.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like games and sports
Spirit, Strang, Skill and Stamina are important in the world of sports.
This isn't the source of any player's success.
Next morning, two meetings were held in memory.
First of all, the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta is an opportunity to collaborate with our para athletes.
Similarly, there was a chance to visit the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
In the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth have performed well so far.
We achieved 13 medals and 3 medals in MICS.
This is the story of Indian Sports, which touches new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where no one has ever thought.
He lost his father when he was 8.
He lived in the orphanage for the next eight years.
After leaving the orphanage, DTC buses were cleaned up and worked as a waiter on the shores of Delhi.
Today, in the same Narayan International, gold medals are being received for India.
Not only this, look at the heights of excellence in India's games.
India has never won a senior level or junior level or an Olympic medal in Judo.
But Tababi Devi, in the Youth Olympics, received a silver medal in Judo and composed history.
Tababi Devi, a 16-year-old player, lives in a village in Manipur.
The boy's father is a worker, and his mother is fishing.
Often this kid's family had no money to buy food.
Even in such a situation, Tababi Devi's enthusiasm has not taken the fort.
And that's why he earned a medal for the country and composed history.
There are numerous stories like this.
Every life is inspiring.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is the bottom of New India.
My dear countrymen, in 2017, we have successfully organised the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
The entire world appreciated it as a successful tournament.
This year, India has had the privilege of organizing the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
In the minds of all Indians, whatever games they play, whatever games they want, there must be a challenge to the hockey.
India has gifted great hockey players.
The story of Hockey will be incomplete without this great sportsperson of India whenever he talks about World Hockey.
Hockey magician Major Dhyanchand knows the whole world.
After that, a long journey from Balwinder Singh Seer, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pilgrimage has been undertaken.
Even today, the team is inspiring the new generation of Hockey by the success of India's sportspersons due to their superiority and dedication.
Sports is a good opportunity for lovers to see thrilling games.
Go to Bhubaneswar and boost the enthusiasm of the Indian team and encourage all the teams.
But in a new era, in a new way, in a new generation, with new zeal and enthusiasm, with new zeal, these things are coming forward today.
Some people teach children, some teach adults, some are engaged in cleanliness, some are helping farmers.
There is no desire behind doing all this, but there is dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young man learned to play a wheelchair basketball to help the wheelchair basketball team.
This enthusiasm, this dedication is a work on Mission Mode.
Does any Indian feel proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I looked at the issues related to Mann Ki Baat, I got a very attractive note from Pondicherry to Shri Manish Mahapatra.
In Mann Ki Baat, he has written in MyGov, Please tell us how the people of India and their lives and traditions are the best examples of co-operation with nature.
They have to learn from what we need to make traditions a part of our lives for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I congratulate you for putting this issue in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter of inspiring us to look at our glorious past and culture, which today speaks of environment protection, especially in the world, and is looking for new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and plants as gods and goddesses.
The people of Madhya Pradesh, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, celebrate Almast and Arjun with respect.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to preserve the environment.
They don't want to give up their lives, especially for protecting trees, but they don't allow a tree to suffer.
The Arabs in Arunachal think they have a direct connection with the tigers.
They think they're like their sisters.
People in the Warlin community of Maharashtra see tigers as guests and bring abundant presence of tigers for them.
The Gaud people of Madhya Pradesh have stopped fishing in some parts of the Kaithan river during the fishing season.
They see these areas as dependent on fish and they get good fish because of this practice.
Toda, a small entrepreneur of the solitary regions of Nilgiri in south India, has traditionally built their homes because of the available goods available in that area.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living quietly and mutually but if someone harms their natural resources then they will not be able to fight to protect their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were tribal people.
Come on, let's clear their respect.
My dear countrymen, we talk about those who do extraordinary things for the society in Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Bhai Gurubachan Singh of Punjab.
An ordinary teacher, the farmer, Gurubachan Singh, was married.
But an ordinary farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh, who told the father of the murderer, you will be surprised when he knows that it is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them to promise me no more vaccine will be burnt in the field.
You can imagine how big social power it has.
Gurubachan Singh ji said this thing is simple, but this thing tells us how vast his personality is, there are many families in our society that make personal matters a matter of social harmony.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh ji presented such an example in front of us.
I read another village in Punjab about the rock majara near Nabha.
The people of stone mazra use technology for this purpose, instead of burning bio-coal, to the ground floor.
Greetings to Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
Congratulations to people from all over the country who have made great efforts to keep the environment clean and clean.
You are living as the real infinite heirs of the Indian tradition of healthy lifestyle.
Om Duh Shanti, Shanti Prithvi Shanti Prithvi Shanti, Awaha Shanti Principle, Shanti Shree Shanti Shreeva Shantireva Shanti Shree Shanti Radio or Shanti Shree Shanti Peace Period means peace in all three worlds, in water, in the earth, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in medicines, in the herbs, in the instruments, in the instruments, in the entire universe, in the entire universe.
In the living creatures, in the heart, in me, in you, in the particles of the fire, everywhere.
For India, the First World War was a major event.
Obviously, we had no direct connection to that war.
Yet our soldiers fought bravely, played a very big role and carried out great martyrdom.
When the Indian soldiers came to war, they showed the world that they were not far behind.
In the First World War, the world saw the threshold of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers and almost the same ordinary people have been given pranayama.
Throughout the world, the importance of peace is understood.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today peace and harmony don't mean fighting.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, there is a need to work together and work together.
The development of the poor in the poor is the real symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our north-eastern region is different.
The natural beauty of that place is unique, and the people there are very talented.
Our north-eastern region is now known for a lot of propaganda.
North-Eastern region has grown immensely in terms of organic farming.
A few days ago, the Future Policy Gold Award 2018 was concluded to promote Sikkims sustainability.
I mean food and agricultural organisation.
The award for excellent policy formulation in this sector is equivalent to the Oscars in the region.
Moreover, our Sikkim State has been awarded the award by abandoning 51 policy mandated by 25 countries.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October ends.
There's a lot of change in the weather.
As the weather changes, festivals also take place in a manner like Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaydooj and Chhath.
May your progress be an important part of the country's progress in your life as an opportunity to move forward in a mission mode and take a resolve.
