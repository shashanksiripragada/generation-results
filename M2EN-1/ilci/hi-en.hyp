His language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat , therefore , is a mixture of both in language .
This is called ' kutchi ' .
By the way it is ' bid ' , it has no script of its own .
If you have to write Kutchi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where earthquakes have occurred many times and the whole city has collapsed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer is near Anjar .
The story of Jessel Toral is very interesting .
If we return by the way we had come then we will have to take a month 's holiday and on the other hand we will open schools in Bombay .
So what to do  Now by telling the fast buses of Gujarat one will travel in the railways .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a meter gauge and a small train will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Bombay .
The tourism industry , which is considered to be the mainstay of the economy of Rajasthan , is going through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and increasing terrorist threats in South Asia the tourism business has been deeply pushed .
With the point of view of tourism a significant reduction has been recorded in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan among the major states of the country these days .
The latest figures released recently by the Rajasthan government show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics the number of tourists in the country has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 native and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 native and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday Makers says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
Recent years have passed best for Rajasthan in terms of tourism .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , bawadis , forest everything is the same old for ripening the tourists .
All the governments talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism in the tourism sector but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists have also stained the image of this state at the international level .
Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state years back but it has remained confined to paper only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 with the aim of promoting tourism and developing tourism infrastructure .
This corporation provides facilities for housing , food , traffic , boating etc to the tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motals , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The loss of RTDC during 2008 - 09 was 185 lakhs , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even forty percent of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of corporation are also bringing it a big loss .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attracted towards this railway .
Despite reducing the fare this could not attract tourists .
Likewise in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC , this year this number decreased to 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC has been this that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels or Royal Railways .
This rail is continuously benefiting .
Last year, RTDC got a profit of Rs. 9.5 crore from this train.
Due to this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his heart , he can make gold from the earth .
Subrata Roy has made it true by settling modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
The dream he had dreamt of progressing day and night shows happiness in his eyes .
His happiness was also seen at the inauguration of the private airport of Ambel Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has succeeded in making its place as a great city .
In this city spread over 10 , 000 acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available only on 9  land .
Trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available on 91 percent land .
Several industrialists came forward to build their own houses in this city , built for millionaires and today there are about 800 families living in this city .
Initially industrialists and viceroys bought their Asia as holiday home here but now they have made it their first home and from here they also travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley is Koyarigarh Fort which provides beauty to this area .
The ruins of Likawali in the western Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in excavation .
On the pillars of stones of this temple the excavation of the idols of lotus and gods - goddesses has been obtained which are mostly in a ruined state .
Malini Thana is an important place in this area .
A Dussehra statue of Goddess Durga has been found at this place .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the glory of Goddess Tamreshwari is found .
At the time of Chetia kings this goddess was recognized far and wide in the extra - eastern hills .
The people of the tribe here used to worship the goddess .
Human sacrifice was also offered here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories prevalent here this place is only an old Vidarbha where once the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The tribes of Diguru , Mishmi etc . here guide the travellers .
These people themselves have great reverence for this kunda .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far flung areas come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their story .
The ruins of bathing ghats , pucca stairs and another pond surrounded by pucca parallels and the remnants of wide roads are still singing silently of their ancient legend .
We reach ero for four hours by jeep from North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the tourists .
This is the same pleasant place where emergencies live .
It takes several days to reach here before the road to Jeep .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premaroz , walnut , wild curtains , strawberries and rasberries enjoy the visitors .
Apple and potato are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of emergency people .
Emergency has made it its heaven by its tireless labour .
The cultivation of rice is very good here .
This place is a reserve of rice .
This ten - miles long plateau is a living example of their labour and efficiency of cultivation .
Their irrigation requirements are met by the Kali river .
Pine trees plant four moons in the beauty of this valley .
In the middle of the snowclad mountain range of the left hand the sight falls on the slight redness emerging in the sky on the horizon .
There is a lot of coolness in air .
Along with the coolness piercing in the environment one also feels moisture .
On the floor of the wood with the sound of a garbage below the legs the layer of the palm spread on the floor is seen .
There is softness in the atmosphere and nothing is visible because of the blurred shadow before sunrise .
Eyes stay stuck on the redness of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench lying in the balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the palate with the sound of a light crunch and the hand separates from the shock by the feeling of coolness .
Thousands of miles away from your country , this is the first experience in the life of spending night in this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent in Geneba or around it .
The densely populated population on either side of the thin Balkati river on both sides of the valley is spread to a great extent on slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Rhone , on both sides of which many small towns are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the crawling vehicles on it have begun to clear .
The distance of 300 kms and journey of two and a half hours from the car is half way , along with Geneva lake and half rock river coming from east direction Geneva lake near the city named Montreu which is called Eczemon -LRB- Lock Lama -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again turns towards the west after forming a river .
On the right side across the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Leuk we come on the mountainous path towards the north leaving this highway from the left side by the axit .
Because of the slope of the mountain being southward the sun of Aparana is giving abundant sunshine to all the ribs .
The quantity of ice in comparison to the valley is less - equal to almost no .
As the height moves towards the height , the intensity of the snow has started increasing .
Despite heavy snowfall on both the sides of the road there is no special comfort in the air due to the clear sky and shining sun .
On this roaming hilly road the journey of approximately 20 k . . in half an hour reaches a small village named Thel .
Chalet -LRB- hallet -RRB- - There are large bungalows made of slopy roof , completely of wood .
The three - storeyed bungalow ' s cement concrete basement has rooms for controlling essential services like electricity , water , ladries , including parking of trains .
Valai is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center for making grapes .
37  of the entire canton is cultivated by grapes .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley the gardens of grapes provide a wonderful dimension to the beauty there .
Taking wine cards on the floor , getting them a stroll at night in the villages there and taking them to the factories of grapes wine testing is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aigle there is a huge museum of grapes made in the 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to get afresh booking .
Once again we pass through the same jungle , frustrated with the claim .
By the pricking questions of children on the way up to three - four k . . the mind becomes even more distressed .
Suddenly , at a turn , the scene brings about dramatic and psychological changes .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the slope above the deep valley a beautiful herd of houses is settled .
On the flat slope above the village people are skiing in the snow .
Above the skiing slope till the peak of the mountain the dense forest of cedar is spread .
Dense snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining due to the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same silence is covered .
The Dhawal Himalayan Empire from the peak of the mountain all around to the valley .
Within the next five minutes we reach a large round about between that town .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Luckerabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and tourists coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for staying in 1500 , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
So far 65 gold of hot water has been found in Luckerabad .
40 lakh litres of hot water -LRB- up to 51 o ' clock -RRB- emanating from these are brought to the small and big 30 thermal pools , some pools are inside five star hotels and others are according to the pockets of people of various income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
In the blooming sun the thick layer of ice is shining above the roof of the houses .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the preserved places in the form of heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to the taxis of Sikkim hence there is no checking .
The journey is continuing , the state is second , but the mountains are the same , the trees are the same , the fragrant winds are there .
The moisture on the whole body is the same .
Surmai brightness is the same in the rainy season .
As soon as the plan for the journey to Darjeeling was confirmed , the sight of Karsingh was first spread .
Curseong is a small town of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunlight .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
When we moved towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning tea gardens smile and welcome those moving towards themselves .
Passing through the road between the tea gardens charms the heart for the first time .
On one side the green mountain filled with forests , and on the other side deep green trench .
Here sometimes the jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
There was an empire of greenery all around .
Once upon a time I was stunned to see these natural forests or to the tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beautiful jungle was as beautiful as the tea garden spread far and wide .
If we look at the roads on the way then the creation looks wonderful .
The snake ' s snake was crooked and the way was going on .
The time was also passing .
If not , the jungle and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements would be seen .
From afar a hill appeared very dense from houses and houses .
It was cursing .
Staying here at one place we made a program to roam around the whole day .
Therefore taking a car they set out on a tour of Karsing .
First dire park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
The train had to be left very low to reach up to the climb i . . deer park .
Despite its beauty in Kurseong , it has not yet been developed as a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the road being desolate the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by the jungles and the joy of climbing the road between the sunrise trees was giving us courage .
The next place was the Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at the height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the era of the British lovers used to jump from here and give life .
At present , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a staircase dome here from whose height a beautiful sight is present on observing the whole city .
Nearby in the tea garden women loaded basket on their backs in breaking the tea - wife running at a very fast speed .
Cursing is a museum outside the city , but on that day we could not go there because it was more necessary to tour the free environment of tea gardens .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a matter of great concern that if it was raining then how would we roam .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed blooming sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining .
On growing a little more below from here Gangamaya surrounded by hills was found .
Here amidst the rocks the view of the waterfalls is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of stones - stones are charming then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are located very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
After climbing up with the help of a car we saw Teresia loop in Darjeeling .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of binoculars .
The mood of the weather was still fine .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , we started to swing and swing .
In the evening plans were made to walk and shop on the mall road .
During the tour of Darjeeling television trains put four moons in the journey .
Travelling from Darjeeling to Darjeeling and traveling from Dhume to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and a break in the garden here .
From this route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its shape and color are different .
Here tea is not the greenery of gardens but the movement of forests and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot - Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam Darjeeling in the shade of cool breeze , but here the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling binded me with itself .
My recent visit was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither abroad nor outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , a ship of water or some royal train or a city like a pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to a particular attraction people come to snatch .
The place I am going to talk is just about four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come here has really turned into a jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those living there .
In my ears the words of my guide , Ram Babu Meena , ' Sahiba , before that we could not even think that we could live like this in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not even get work in the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajbgarh , used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He has pushed his own speech into a new colour .
Sahiba ' is the style of Aman Bagh .
Nobody calls you from English origin .
Aman Garden is a really peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the nearby areas also .
Of the people who spent holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan many would have toured Bhangadh of the ghosts , why should I go away , some among the people of Jaipur would probably have spent night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there , but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had wandered and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there on the feast of my foreign guests , then it seemed as if those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time they should definitely go to Aman Garden .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
It was built in nineteen , hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by the hills and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Garden attracts you .
As soon as you come inside the way you are welcomed it feels that attention has been paid to divine peace here .
The Mantra of Mangalachar is lively pronounced with the binding of Mauli in the wrist .
We reached the slope in the evening , and We intended to make a circumference for it .
My host Jackie , who has been a gentleman , said suddenly , ' This is interesting .
All are inspired by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic ' no wonder that Aman Bagh has got the award recently .
The manager set our programme for the morning .
First of all a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
He saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
Such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience for Jackie .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are million dollars precious moments .
The way of saying goodbye to Aman Bagh was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they left us .
Now it came to be understood that why does tourist come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept to show the Tribal Life .
Is this right
Of course this is not one in many states and tourists show a lot of interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It includes staying there , eating etc .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places where there has not been much development and where time has not had any special effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Also where old tourist sites etc . are present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing tridisional cuisine serving .
Actually , the aim of such tourism is to make tourists aware of the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Just tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without getting disturbed .
Yes , it is definitely so much that along with giving a lot of time in less expense and comfort these tourists keep a demand for patience with you .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching through a foreign destination bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior people of military , children etc get discounts on them , then there is an arrangement of discount for two people as well .
By the way , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , therefore in the last moments it is better that you plan a little before by doing a bus tour .
Find out about the round trip instead of the two tickets .
They are cheap .
The rules regarding baggage are very strict , therefore inquire about the size and weight of the luggage .
It may not be that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or have to pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensating insurance or loss from the tourist company .
Carry on bags are right , carry on .
because they get fit in the rack over the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus you will have the responsibility of luggage .
From where you have to take a bus reach there one hour before time .
During the Big Season you should take special care of this .
Actually , as soon as you reach the best seat option will be with you .
While choosing a seat keep in mind the confirm .
If there are more tremors in the previous seat , it is not conferable to read in the next seats .
If you have to go to Loose again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now it ' s a clever thing .
If you are both in a hurry to grab , then sit on a corner seat and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then while sucking the seat keep in mind this thing as it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identification by bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not leave your luggage in the seat , because on its disappearance the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time then you can find a new passenger in your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if Rome was not seen in Europe , nothing was seen .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is among those old cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .

Inside the temple idols of gods and goddesses are made around .
By the way , in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens and gardens in Rome but Villa Borgius is unmatched .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see it .
Definitely go to the museum built here also , because on missing this you will miss the opportunity to enjoy the best sculpture .
The idols built here are unique and looks so alive as if they will speak now .
Here a idol lying on a bed of Napoleon ' s first sister Paulin , who was married to the Borgis royal family , feels so alive that you will not be able to live without seeing it for a while .
The special attraction of Rome is its fountains .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is  Trevy Fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come back to Rome , then he should put a coin in the fountain with this desire .

Taking full enjoyment of cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and world famous Goan cuisines on the roads of Goa the Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option .
If seen on today 's date then for Maldives the cheapest per capita fare from Delhi is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Male then you can still find hotels in a little rent but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
C cruise proves beneficial here .
In the first week of December , Louis cruise from Kochi started the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems the Louis cruise has postponed its services , but they are expected to start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a cruise of three days at the rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person per night on the Louis cruise ship M . . Aquamarine .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are older children below 15 years of age are absolutely free .
and what else .
The fares of cruise include tea - breakfast , food .
Entertainment of every time together .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in the Maldives according to your pocket - From sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If you suddenly get a plane standing in front of you while roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel toys .
But this twin oter plane with 12 - 15 seats is excellent for roaming like Maldives in Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- .
When it gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the surface of water , it is not known .
In the whole flight you do not have the experience of flying ordinary airplanes .
Every time your eyes remain strong below the window , watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of the Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Tros Maldives is one of them which has twenty c planes .
If you want then you can travel for an hour in about four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or you can hire the entire plane for a long time -LRB- if the pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go beyond Male Island on any island then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And that ' s a journey that might never end up with you .
C . Plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the best way Mavilevaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the capital ' s largest antique and sovereign shop in Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the salesmen were listening to the speech given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen one day earlier .
Say honestly , I have not seen any Hindustani listening to the speeches of the presidents or the prime minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a novel creation of this earth , such seriousness was inevitable .
Many people might have understood the meeting done by the cabinet of Maldives in water in October , but going to Maldives it feels as if the wrath of nature snatches it from us then how much the world will become .
There is something similar in the beauty of this place .
In that small country it is not as if it is not so beautiful .
Returning to the jetti to go back on that cruise of the market , when the eyes went in the water of the sea along with the barren road then it felt as if the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of the lamppost , fish swimming in a depth of several meters were seen with all its colours .
This was part of the sea which was very close to the city .
If you can see a few centimeters clearly in sea or river water adjacent to any city of India then you will find yourself happy .
While returning to M . V . Aquamarin , he was roaming around in Jehan for two hours in the evening .
Coral reef -LRB- muga chutney -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones attached to the tombs you will get muga rocks .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security personnel far and wide .
With fun we were taking photographs of gardens and verandahs just fifty metres away from the door of his bungalow by extending our hand inside .
Can you think of a leader ' s house in India
It was also known that the President sometimes crossing the roads on foot two blocks ahead reaches his office .
Everything about the Maldives was about to be overwhelmed .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
The day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of the Trace Maldives by cutting the round of the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near Male we immediately recognized the plane passing through above .
His pictures that he had seen .
But it wasn ' t supposed that the next day there would be a ride .
We were about to go to Rangali island one hundred and five kilometres away from the C plane of Tros Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of about a thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a thrilling and enthusiastic flight .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotels on the Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In a world that had nothing to do with any outside world .
It was not like this that it was difficult to get out such beauty or luxury .
There can also be a walk on the Konarad or a battery driven cart .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was amazing .
Right now we could not even comfort ourselves with the nature around , that we reached such a place , it was unimaginable .
While descending down several meters below the stairs in the water of the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
The room was actually a dining room .
Across the glasses on all sides we could see a unique kind of small fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating while sitting on decorated tables was very exciting in itself .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch coming on this island from Male to C . plane is only 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to shed our passports in water .
But he knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we returned with the same hope that at some point , at some point , fate would definitely be brought here .
For many days he was planning to go out of Delhi but because of his busyness it was not possible .
Wildlife was fond of childhood then thought why this time gym carbet should be taken .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after a bike till Pegong Lake ahead of Khardungla Pass in Ladakh .
In the early hours of December 27 we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the fury that had come out of the hustle and bustle , the fog triggered us .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
The fog above and the bad road in front .
Sometimes he felt that he had fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
There was no special program on that day , but despite being cold we went to roam on the edge of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we left for Carbet Museum , which was at a distance of 2 kms . near Dhangadi Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening .
It was decided from Delhi that if I would definitely see the lion roaming around in the jungle then all night I would see lions in dreams .
Suddenly I heard a tremendous roar between the depths of the night , and then the dogs which began to bark , would not stop for two hours .
Therefore it was suggested to roam around Kala Dhungi and Carbet Fall .
Kaladhungi is 30 kms away , while carbet falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
On returning twelve o'clock .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this cave .
On reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged siteing in number one site Bijrani there .
On asking about number one it was told that Grasland is more there and Tigers come to the same direction to escape from cold during this period .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the forest inside .
We saw many kinds of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had long teeth .
I did photography very well .
Meanwhile the guide started tracking Tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
In many places we also saw marks of their claws , but I was sad because of not seeing Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind , Tiger ' s fitur was riding .
Then I remembered Haldwani ' s old friend .
I called him the same way .
I told him that I had come to Carbet .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
His words were pierced like arrows .
I said slowly , no .
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take safari for the inside .
