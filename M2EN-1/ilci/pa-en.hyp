Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhi on one side of Kuppu and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language as well .
We call it ' kukhi ' .
As such it is ' bidding ' , it is not its own script .
If you have to write cotton then it is written in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj only is that Anjar city where several times the earthquake has come and the entire city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisalmer is very interesting .
If we return from the road from where we had come then we will have to take a full month 's holiday and on the other hand the school will open in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now telling the fast buses of Gujarat to Ta Ta Ta Ta Ta - Ta will travel in the railways .
The small train of metre gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there towards meter gauge a small train will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad a big train of Broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan has been running since ancient times in these days .
Due to the increasing terrorist threats in business and South Asia the tourism trade has reached a deep impression .
From the point of view of tourism in these days there has been a reduction in cough in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan frozen in the major states of the country .
The recent data released by the Rajasthan government shows that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics the number of domestic tourists has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 crore and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are particularly concerned about this situation .
Rajputana Gradually the director of Mexico Sanjay Kaushik says that positive incidents and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even develop a strong base infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in the number of foreign tourists coming to India in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism there are excellent pastures for Rajasthan in recent years .
After 2008 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism something new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , wilderness , forest everything is the same old for enjoying the tourists .
In the tourism sector the matter of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism does not happen much to all the governments but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time along with foreign tourists in recent years incidents of blatant and cruelty in Rajasthan have also donated the shadow of this state at international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of excellent tourism in the state but it has remained confined to newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- Artificial Intelligence -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of inviting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had established artificial intelligence in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motor , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two railway stations on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained alright for many years .
The deficiency of artificial dysentery in 2008 - 909 was 35 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even 40 percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it extremely bad .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not be attracted towards this train .
Despite reducing the fares this could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist villages built by Artidissi in this fair , this number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the satisfactory thing for artificial intelligence has been this that there has been no dearth of tourism towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the Royal Railways .
This rail is continuously benefiting .
Last year Arti DC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
Due to this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person wants to do something in his heart then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by settling the modern city Embo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahadir of Maharashtra .
The sweetness that he had seen shows happiness in his eyes while progressing day by day .
His happiness was also visible at the time of the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place as a better city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available only on 9 percent land .
91 percent land has been provided with wildlife , lakes , cattle and other facilities .
Many industrialists have come forward to build their houses in this city made for crores of rupees and today there are almost no families living in this city .

According to the stories mentioned here this place is an old scholar , where once the king used to rule Bhishmak .

Near Brahmokund only is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far flung areas come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal Pradesh the ruins of roaming in Divang - Valley district are also very important .
The ruins of bricks near Roing are still telling their stories .
The deficiency of bathing , ripe stairs and one more lake being surrounded by rippling crooks from all four sides and getting the remnants of widespread roads are still counting their ancient grandeur .

In the middle of the chains laden with the sight of the left hand a slight redness emerging in the sky is felt .
Good cough in air is cold .
There is also a feeling of moisture along with the pricking cold in the environment .
Due to the sound of crust under the legs the layer of crust fixed on the floor of the wood is visible .
There is silence in the environment and because of the blurredness of the sunrise before sunset nothing else is visible .
The sight remains sharp on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on the bench lying in the balcony .
Just as one handles the smooth layer of the palate licks with the sound of a slightly light wrinkle and the hand separates from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in coming to this small village settled amidst these mountains laden with the snow of Switzerland to spend the night .
This is my third delivery in the body .
Before this spend most of the time in geneba or around it .
On both the sides of the Balakhandi river the dense population settled in the valley is spread very high on the mild slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Roman valley on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .

Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake moves towards the west after becoming a river again .
On the right side across the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gangtok , Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the left side we come to the mountainous path towards the north leaving this highway .
Because of the slope of the mountain being southern the Sun of Afghans is giving abundance of sunshine to all the eye lashes .
The quantity of snow falling from the valley is less here - approximately not equal .
Living leads to the height of life , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good cough being frozen on both the sides of the road there is no special cold in the air due to the clear sky and bright sun .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this roaming hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
The shawls of shawls are full of huge multicoloured bungalows made of wood .
Three storied rooms are to control essential services like electricity , water , lodge along with parking of vehicles in the basement built by the limited concrete tower of this bungalow .
Vlaiyan is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making wine of grapes .
On 37  of the total area of Cantonment there is cultivation of grapes .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley the gardens of Gangotri present a marvellous dimension to the beauty there .
Taking the gardens of gardens , touring them , resting the night in the villages there and roaming in the jewellery of greedy wine is an inseparable part of the tourism business here .
In a small colony named Again there is a huge collection of figurine liquor in a net made in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to book agrims .
Once again we pass through the same jungle while roaming from Dawanal .
The mind becomes even more depressed by the pricking questions of children on the way up to three - four kms .
On one side of Sahastra dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the slope above the deep valley a beautiful garden of houses is settled .
On touring above the village people are skiing in the snow .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope the dense forest of Mak deodar is spread .
On all four sides dense snow has fallen .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are sparkling because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same silence is spread .
All around from the peak of the mountain to the valley the kingdom of Dhawal Himalaya .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big goal chakra in the middle of that town .
The name of the city is Lukrabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Luckerabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and patients coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 1500 bedding hotels , camping centres of tents , 90 beds and 50 restaurants here for stay .

It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only be taxed , that is why there is no checking .

The essence moisture on the whole body is the same .
In the season of rains the light of sunrise is the same .
The plan for Darjeeling journey is fixed . First of all the decisions were taken for the treachery of Karsyang .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunlight jungles .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If you move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning itself tea garden welcomes those who roam around in Mussoorie .
Taking a road between tea gardens hypnotise the mind in the first time .
On one side the green mountain filled with jungles , on the other side is Hagri Khai .
Sometimes the jungle here and there used to be tea gardens .
All around there was the empire of Harsil .
Once I flew , I saw these natural jungles or the tea plants planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness it was , the more beautiful the tea garden spread far and wide .
If seen on the road of the road then it seems to be very marvellous .
The fourteenth and twelveth path of the snake was passing through .
Time was also passing .
If not , then jungle and tea gardens .
Sometimes the hustle-bustle settlement is visible .
From a distance a very dense sight has been seen from a hilly house , house etc .
This was Karsiyang .
Staying here at one place we made an instrument of roaming all day .
Therefore taking a train we set out on a tour of Karsyang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the upper slope i . . deer park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being enchanted with the beauty of Karsiyang one has not yet been developed as a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the road being desolate the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and passing through the trees of Dhupi was giving us courage .
The next place is the sea eagle craft .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by blooming from here .
Film , this is a park and restaurant .
There is a staircase here at a height of which a beautiful view is seen after observing the whole city .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea plantations running at the extremely fast speed on the back .
There is a museum outside Karsyang city , but that day we could not go there , because touring the unfathomable environment of tea gardens became more important .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was very anxiety with this that how would we roam if this was happening like this
The coincidence of Magar was very good that after reaching till the Rock Garden we roamed in the sunrise .
This garden is a beautiful place contiguous with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more pleasant than this .
On climbing a little below from here one gets Gangamaya surrounded by hills .
The view of the waterfalls between the rocks here is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of stones are engraved here then the Mayavi world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is rich with stones .
Both of these places are very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasya loop in Darjeeling rising upwards with the help of the vehicle .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of far-off .
The joy of the weather had spread till now .
But as soon as we progressed towards monastery , where did we appear to be decreasing and we started shivering .
In the evening plan was made to stroll and shop at Malrod .
During the tour of Darjeeling four fountains are set up in the journey of the Tawai train .
The journey from Darjeeling to Dhoom and Darjeeling to Tawai Train is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here boating in Mirik lake and entertainment in the garden .
From this route travellers also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handicrafted swords of Nepali artisans are available .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , but there is a movement of forests and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot - Besides and Lolegaon , which is full of jungles and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata , touring Darjeeling the shadow of the cold , then tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling bound me with ourselves .
Recently a small journey of mine was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor of Rajasthan , but of Jaipur very close .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like Gulmarg or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of this a special attraction people start smoking .
The place where I am going to talk this bus has been ready about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has come there , that has really made Mangla in the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears my guide Ram Babu narrates the words of Meena , Saheb could not even think before this that we could stay in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did n't even get work in the heritage hotel .
Ajabagarh resident Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now this unique royal palace is in Amn Bagh .
He has drowned his speaking in a new color .
Saheb ' is the habit of Amn Bagh .
Nobody calls you English language there .
Amn Bagh is actually an amazing chain with all the conveniences .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also makes you know from the surrounding areas .
Among the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people might have toured Bhangarh of the earth , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchhek might have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of the Amman garden large people of the country and abroad reach there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there with great fanfare but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he had reached Bhangarh on his own .
This time when suddenly I reached there on the occasion of my foreign guests , then I felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time they should definitely go to Ammon Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to fight for hunting .
Its construction was done in the nineteenth century .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
In the shade of dense trees surrounded by mountains the first glimpse of the Amn Bagh takes you to the fore .
As soon as you come in the way you are welcomed , it seems as if attention has been paid to the divine peace here .
The life-force of the mantra of Mangalacharan is pronounced in Kalai with the binding of pearls .
We had reached Tsomoriri in the evening and we intended to plant a cycle that garden .
My dear ones who have been desirous of me , Sahasa Udi ' is interesting ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
Their lighting is the most beautiful .
It is not surprising at all that the artists had recently received the award .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all a journey on foot with Rambabu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on a square road we saw the fort of Ajabagarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year it was not rainy but for the first time we saw the agriculture of tobacco .
If for this such a glimpse of giving rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning and evening I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The way to say the Alvida of Amn Bagh was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they sold us .
Now it was understood that why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tourism packages are also kept to show tribe life .
Is it right
Undoubtedly there is one such or the other in many states and tourists show cough interest in them as well .
These tours are generally prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to a different place .
In this stopping , eating etc are also included .
This way there is an attempt to explore such a place where there is no excessive development and where there is no special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time old tourist spots and others are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing tridisional cuisine survey .
Actually , the aim of such tourism is to make the tourists comfortable with the ways and traditions of staying at that place .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think , but such tours are interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
With this despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book for a long time without distributing it .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving less expense and peaceful filled time this tour will certainly keep a demand for sermons with you .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching through a foreign destination bus tour .
Take a best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior people of military , children and others get discounts on them , then there is arrangement of discount for both people as well .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , that is why in the last moments it is better than doing a bus tour to plan that the planning takes place very early .
Instead of towel ticket you can find out about the round book .
It is cheap .
Regulations about bacteria are very hard hence ask about the size and weight of the goods .
It may not be that you have to leave something on the terminal or you have to fill the extra percentage .
Also know the rules of compensation of insurance or loss with tourism company .
Carry on bags are right , but lets go .
Because these fit in a rake come above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while chewing the bus during tourism the number of items will be yours .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During BG season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat operation will be with you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the concrete .
If you feel more hungry on the previous seat , then reading on the next seats is not conferred .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more distorted then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now there is talk of one drive .
If you are in the background of both the armies , then sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other side .
If the crowd does not get much in the bus then there will be planning .
If there is facility of swimming in the bus then while sucking at the seat keep in mind this thing as it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make an identity with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance the bus people do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can find some new traveller at your place and you will have to arrange another bus on the terminal .

Both the hotels of Ginger built in a place named Wakad situated on the Middle and Puna-Bangalore highway of Pimpri Industrial Region are equipped with maximum facilities .
The pedestrian state of Maharashtra Goa is contiguous with its beautiful sea shores and diverse water bodies which is a heavenly reserve for the tourists where one gets to see the beauty of the ancient times with the tour of ancient churches .
Situated in Panchim the capital of Goa , Ginger Hotel makes the journey of the western coast excellent .
Ginger Hotel situated here is an excellent option for spending comfortable days enjoying cycling , reverting , cool breeze and world famous Goan restaurants on the roads of Goa .
If seen in today 's review then for Maldives the cheapest person returns 25000 rupees per person from Delhi .
After that if you stay in Malays then you can also get hotels in a little rent but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
Seasons prove beneficial here only .
In the first week of December Cooch Beach Laui Tiger started the loneliness of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Louis is a European company and there is a lot of popularity in the business of hotels and restaurants .
Though due to some difficulties Louis Tsomoriri has just strengthened its services , but since October it is expected that they will be resurrected .
You can go to Maldives for a walk of three days at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person on the ship EMV Aquarine of Louis Tsomoriri .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If two are big then children less than 15 years of age are completely free .
What else should be done
Tea - breakfast , food etc . are included in the fare of curd .
Every time the entertainment gather .
On reaching the capital Malai you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If you suddenly get a sea plane standing in front of you while roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But this twin Oter Plane with 12 - 15 seats is neutral for touring Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
Walking like a speed boat on the surface of the water these races get up in the air , do not know .
You do n't feel the roaming of ordinary aeroplanes in the entire slope .
Every time your eyes keep looking down at the islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
Everything looks so clean .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them with twelve plains .
If you want then you can roam around a thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- in an hour or you can take the entire plane on rent for the lunch of your day -LRB- if it is necessary -RRB- .
If you go beyond the Male island on any island then the journey of Sea Plane will be necessary because this is the journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you might never feel like ending .
Sea Plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in Umma -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and souvenir shops of the capital in Ahmadi Bazar of Malaysia .
All the soldiers were listening to the speech given by the Maldives President Mohammad Nasheed in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
If told honestly then no Indian could see the speeches of the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of a real creation of this earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people might have considered the meeting done in the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October as a token , but Maldives feels that if the coffee of nature loses it then how much will the world be .
There is something like this in its beauty .
In a small country like that one does not like to enjoy such beauty .
Returning from that tour of the market turning towards the jetty to go on its own , when the narrow burbass went in the waters of the sea along with circus then it felt as if the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clean that under the light of Lamppost fish spread in a depth of several metres were clearly visible with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you can also see a few centimetres in sea or river water connected with any city of India then you will consider yourself fit .
While returning to M . . Aquarine two hours of the evening spent in Malaysia were roaming in the brain .
Coral reef -LRB- rocks -RRB- are the life here .
Even on the stones attached to the tombs you will get rocks of rocks .
Just a while before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we had stayed outside his official residence .
It was not certain that we were ahead of the residence of the best personality of any country , there was no security service till far and wide .
By enjoying our hands inside the gate of his bungalow we were pulling photographs of gardens and verandahs only 50 metres away .
That you can think of such a leader 's house in India .
It was also known that the President sometimes crossing the road on foot two blocks go ahead to his office .
Everything about Maldives was astonishing .
That is why I was waiting for the next day with patience .
It seemed as if that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat took us to the airport island from Tirthankar .
From there we reached the base of the Trans Maldives by cutting the cycle of the runway .
Last evening when Tsomoriri was reaching near Malaysia then we were carrying out the plan immediately .
Such pictures which were seen , are of them .
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
From the sea plane of Trans Maldives we were going to Rangali island one hundred and five kilometres away .
It was amazing to see hundreds of sand and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from Sea Plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres .
This beauty of water is not found anywhere else .
There was a breathing storm by thrill and excitement .
But on reaching the Canadian Cantonment of the Hillton Hotels on the Rangali island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world whose external world there was no accommodation .
The architecture was not like this that it was difficult to get out the beauty or grandeur from there .
Touring Kornad can also be done on foot or by a battery operated train .
On both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island the scene of water life was amazing .
Now we could not even simplify ourselves with the natural beauty nearby , that we reached such a place , that was called Kalpani .
While descending down several metres below the stairs in the water of the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all sides crossing the glasses we could see humans doing unique types of small fishes , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables there was extremely thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing it and lunching underwater coming in this island from Malaysia to Sea Plane is only 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to give our passports in water .
But we knew that it was not mumkin .
With a heavy heart one has to return with the same hope that sometimes on some turn one will definitely take it 's place .
They were planning to go out of Delhi for several days but due to evening arrangement this was not possible .
If you had a golden ear from childhood then think that why not go to gym carbonate this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after the biking of Pegang Lake ahead of Khardungla Pass in Laddakh .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Germany Corbett from Delhi , but the zeal that had emerged out of it , Core circulated our rapidity .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tired .
Kora from above and bad road in front .
Many times it seemed that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Near our resort park was in Dikuli , which we had booked earlier .
On that day there was no special program , despite being cold we went on roaming on the banks of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there the Corbett Museum came out , which was near the Dhangadi gate two kms very difficult .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
Returning became quite evening .
It was settled from Delhi that if the lions would surely be able to see freedom in the jungle then in the dream of the whole night they kept on showing me lions .
In the midst of the darkness of the night suddenly I heard a storm and after that the dogs who started buzzing would not be silent for two hours .
Therefore the suggestion of touring Kaladungi and Corbett Tower came first .
Kaladungi is 30 kms away , while Corbett falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
On returning we went for about twelve times .
Kaladungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
On reaching Ajmer safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had arranged for skiing in the number one cycle businessman there .
On asking about number one it was told that Grassland is more there and Tigers come on that side only to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and animals there .
Inside we saw two touching elephants which had long teeth .
I roamed and photographed .
In the meantime Gualior started trekking Tiger .
Gualior told that there are tigers near about 150 in the park , some of which have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad not getting a visit to Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind there was a fat of tiger .
Then only I remembered one of my old friends of Hallani .
I took him the same phone .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
Whether or not he asked Tiger .
His words kissed like a pig .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us that you take a journey for inside .
During the journey it was known that due to the passage of highway near the park animals often get stuck to vehicles or die .
