Their language appears different from the Gujarati .
Yes , otherwise .
On one side of Kutch there is a mixture of both Sind and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both languages as well .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
As such there is talk , for which there is no copy of itself .
If you want to come to Kachhi then you will have to come to Gujarati script only .
Near Bhubaneswar itself is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes came and the entire city got destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer is very charming .
If we return by the way we had to take a full month 's holiday and the schools were opened there in Mumbai .

From there the other small train of Mysore Geography reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmedabad the big train of Broad Geography reach Mumbai .
The tourism system considered to be the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan is spending a lot of time in these days .
Due to the dangers of increasing intensity in white mandi and South Asia the arrangement of tourism has been very low .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased a lot during these days .
The government of Rajasthan has been able to find out a new figure released from now that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to the year 2008 .
According to the figures 9 . 87 percent in the number of tourists of the country and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists has decreased .
In 2008 AD a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan , in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participate . In 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , founder of Rajputana Holiday Maykars , has said that due to the incidents of acute mentality and seriousness the tourism industry has been completely affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even developed the tourism system here in a strong and base manner .
Because of this the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent as compared to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the French tourists are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has spent a lot of time in the present year .
After 2002 this was the first time there was a decrease in the number of tourists of Rajasthan .
No new thing has happened with the point of view of tourism .
Desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forests everything is also old for enjoying the tourists .
In the tourist area the talk of working with the name of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism is said to be of great importance to all the governments but nothing has been done in this direction .
Travellers coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time in recent years incidents of violence and violence in Rajasthan have also taken the beauty of this state into art internationally .
The government of Rajasthan has given the status of tourism in Rajasthan a few years back but it has become limited to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government in tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation .
The Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 with the goal of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them based on tourism .
These branches provide the facility of residence , food , commutation , boating etc . for the tourists .
There are a total of 75 branches in this institute .
Among these 39 hotels , 22 motorcycles , eight restaurants , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan wheels , but this institute has also remained behind many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lac which is estimated to increase to 632 lac in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this institute is such that in the last five years even forty percent rooms have not been filled in these hotels .
Along with hotels other institutions also cause a lot of harm to it .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Travellers are unable to attract this train .
Even after decreasing the fare this could not attract the tourists .
This way in the present times during Pushkar Fair also the interest of the tourists was seen less .
In the year 2007 - 08 this fair was held by 398 foreign tourists in the tourism village built after the RTDC , that is why this year this number has decreased to 217 only .
In the midst of all this the pleasant thing of RTDC is that there is no dearth of attracting tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the city train .
This train is continuously beneficial for train .
Last year through this train RTDC has benefitted nine and a half crore rupees .
Due to these deficiency occurring in the tourist area of Rajasthan it has become easy to see the destruction in the tourist area .
Tourism is the most base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person wants to do something in his mind then he can make gold from the soil .

There is very good cold in the air .
Along with the coolness shivering in the environment you also feel moisture .
On keeping the legs the layer of wood starts looking at the layer of a sound .
Because of the weather being silent and massaging ahead of sunrise it is not very visible .
The eye sight remains on the red color of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench situated in the balcony .
The thin layer spreading on the hands starts slipping with a loud sound and the hand is immediately separated by the cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of Switzerland on coming to this small village amidst these mountains covered with snow .
This is the third strand of me in Swiss .
Before this spent a long time in Janiwa or around it .
Maximum people in the valleys on both the sides of the thin Balkhati river are spread to very high rocks .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Ron Ghat on both the sides of which are several small and big cities .
The national highway along the Ron river and the vehicles running on it are clearly visible .

Geneva city is in the west of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the waterfall again turns into a river and flows towards the west .
On the right side while flowing brightly the Alps mountain peaks touching the sky are there .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke on the left side we left this highway , on the northern side we come to the mountainous path .
Due to the presence of the mountainous plains in the southern direction the sun is giving sunshine to all the corners in the third morning .
In comparison to the valleys the snow can not be said to be less here .
The way one goes towards the height , the density of snow increases .
On both the sides of the road much snow is laden while the weather is calm and shining because of the sun there is no coldness in the air .
We reached a small village called Thal by deciding about 20 k . . journey on these narrow mountainous roads half an hour .
Complete it .
In this building of three storeys along with vehicles standing in the foundation made of cement concrete necessary facilities like electricity , water , landlords are included .

There is a very big museum of wine juice in a narrow garden made in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to do agrim booking .
Once again we went through that jungle full of swords .
Till three - four k . . the mind of the children asking questions becomes even more uncomfortable .
Suddenly dramatical and fascinating changes come in the sight of a faeces .
Right straight , on the left side of the road on the very deep valley a group of beautiful houses is established .
People are skiing in snow on the plains flat from the edge of the village .
On the skiing slope the dense forest of Gods is spread till the Konda summit .
On all four sides dense snow has fallen .
In villages the rays of the sun are shining because of falling on the houses .
In five minutes we reached that village .
Peace is spread here as well .
All around from mountain peaks to valleys frozen snow empire .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round wheel situated in the middle of that cycle .
The name of excavation is Lukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the number of people of Lukarabad is approximately 1500 .

It is said in Darjeeling that Sikkim only goes to Sikkim 's taxis so that trekking does not happen .
The journey is going on , the place is on the other side , but the same is the mountain , the same is the trees - plants , the sounding wind .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the light of rising blue in the rainy season .
On the decision of the journey of Darjeeling it was decided that first of all the camps of Karsingh would be taken .
Karsiyang is a small city in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , smoke is full of jungles .
Good tea is famous for production .
If you go towards Darjeeling from Siligudi then in the beginning itself tea gardens welcome the people coming towards themselves in search of smiling .
Going through the middle of tea gardens on the road attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of jungles , on the other side is a dense valley .
Once upon a time wilderness was seen tea gardens here .
On all four sides was the Green Empire .
Once I saw this natural jungle of Kangra or did I see tea gardens laid by humans .
Both were attracting towards themselves .
The more beautiful the tea gardens are the more beautiful .
On going on the roads on the roads the creation looks marvellous .
We were walking barefoot and passing through the way to Pamula .
Time is also passing .
Wild and tea gardens are not at all ends .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
From a distance on a mountain houses and buildings etc . were seen very carefully .
This is Karsiyang .
Stopping here at one place we made a plan to roam around for a whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we left for the journey of Karsingh .
First of all deer park .
There is a large jungle all around a small garden .
Go up that is to reach the deer park one has to leave the vehicle very low .
The beauty of Karsiyang is spread far and wide , till now the development - development of tourist spots has not happened .
Although the city is very good and very peaceful .
While the road was unfinished , to reach the deer park full of jungles , the joy of climbing the path between Mohen and Dhupi trees was giving us courage .
The other place is Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to take life from here .
However , there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Siddhuma cave here which looks beautiful from the height to estimate the entire city .
In the tea gardens nearby women are busy stretching tea leaves while playing their hands very fast by tying bundles on their backs .
There is a museum outside Kashiang city , but that day we could not go there because it seemed very important to roam the beautiful environment of tea garden .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in us , but it was very painful because of this that if rains keep on falling then how can we roam .
But the weather was very good that after reaching till Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place with rocks , waterfalls and forest flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining than this .
While going a little below from here the Ganges flowing on some mountains was seen .
Here amidst rocks a mix of waterfalls is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we saw that the waterfalls of the era of rocks and rocks were frozen here and the waterfalls of the Ganges were decorated with rocks in the world .
These two places are very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw smoke in Darjeeling by climbing up with the help of vehicle .
From here all the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durgina .
The quantity of weather was very clear till now .
When we moved towards Monastery , the crowd of clouds came from where we did n't know and the clouds were hanging .
In the evening there was a plan of shopping stopping on the Mall road .
During the journey of Darjeeling the journey of Toy Train lures like a thrilling moon .
The journey from Darjeeling to Gum and from Dhum to Darjeeling to Tower Train is a special attraction for the tourists .
There is a small break in boating and gardens in the Mirik lake here .
From this route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where hand made sweaters etc . are available in Nepali industry .
There is also facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district and its shape is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens but there are sounds of jungles and waterfalls .
The most famous tourist spot of Kalimpong is Lava and Lolegaon which are filled with jungles and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
When we came to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the cold weather , then the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling were tied on their faces .
My situation was a small journey very thrilling and thrilling for heart .
This journey is not of foreign countries but of Rajasthan , but of Jaipur it is very near .
Tourism is a favorite thing in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes a major place , water ship or city like a city full of rose or pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some major attraction people are brought towards themselves .
The place I am talking about was made just four and a half years ago , but with the construction this place came here and he really saluted the jungle .
Not only their desire to go there but also for the residents there .
In my ears our guide Rambab 's words reflected , did we not even think so before this that we could stay in the jungle .
This place is fifty percent Sibbadi .
Suddenly I felt that even so many locals did n't get work in heritage hotels .
Ajabagarh resident Rambab had worked in Jaipur before this and today this great Shahi Sunderbans is in the Amman garden .
He himself decorated a new way of talking to himself .
Aiya ' is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
There no one will teach you English language .
Aman Bag is actually a peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
This garden also has a history of its own and the most important thing is that you will also get to know about the surrounding places .
The number of people spending holidays in the Chakravarti kings of Rajasthan who have roamed in Bhangarh of the territory , why should they go away from Jaipur , even if Kutch keeps on spending the night in this area .
After the construction of Amman Bagh the elders of the country and abroad came here .
I also remembered that night when Shabana Azmi had called me completely there but I could not go .
On the other hand she herself had gone the way and reached Bhangadh .
This time suddenly I reached there for the invitation of our foreign kinsmen but it seemed as if people want to spend their holidays in less time then they definitely wanted to go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden in those seven gardens where the Alwar king used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in nineteen hundred twenty .
Its ancient wall is witness to those days .
In the shadow of mountains full and sulphur trees the first glimpse of Aman Bagh attracts you .
As you come in the same way you will get welcome by which you will feel that you will pay attention to the great peace here .
Manikarn speaks of the life of the mantras of the artificial mantras along with binding his head .
We reached there in the evening and we felt as if we were put in that garden around .
We were decorating the joke of our guests , immediately gave peace that it was very interesting for me .
All the buildings and forts are inspired .
The beauty of which is the most beautiful .
Yes , on all new things , artistic . No wonder Ambassador has also received the present prize .
Manezer had planned our program in the morning .
First of all a walk with Rambaba and then a jeep safari in Bhangadh .
While walking on a small road we saw the fort of Ajabagarh on which the rays of the sun gradually spread .
We saw the dry lake in which the rails were working .
This year we did n't rain but for the first time we saw the fruit of tobacco .
If you want then this light of rural life is a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a priceless fruit for millions of dollars .
Aman Bagh Alvind is also a traditional way to feed us jaggery and curd .
Then it is understood that why do tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also being run to show the travel life .
What is it true .
There is no doubt and this happens not only in one but in many states and tourists also show more interest in it .
This tour is generally decided for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this stopping , eating etc are also included .
This way an attempt is being made to explore such a place where there has not been much development and the quantity of life of nature and people there has not been a major effect on time .
Along with this there are also ancient tourist sites etc .
Besides this , it is also seen doing treading cuisine .
Actually , tourists with the goal of such travels have to show the customs and customs of that area directly .
Although it feels a bit difficult to think , but such tours are really very interesting and there is a different experience .
The journey of Chalu is our joy .
By this you can enjoy roaming alone even when you are with many people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book for a long time .
Yes , the more important it is here that along with expense and for a long time we make the request to stay comfortable in this journey .
This is the very reason that to enjoy these some things should be kept in mind , especially whenever you are watching with you through a foreign destination check tour .
Before taking a ticket look for a good intermediary .
Scientists , seniors of the army , children etc . get a stone in them , both of them have the facility of stone .
As soon as the ticket is less then it is better to put a bus tour plan for the last minute before the planning cosmetic .
Instead of a tour ticket know about the total tour rate .
This is cheap .
There are some suggestions for stuff also , therefore you should also know about the quantity and weight of stuff .
If this happens then you will have to take some of your stuff in terms of terminal or you will have to pay more money .
Also inform about insurination or damage in tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take it .
Because these fit in the rocks situated on the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus you will have the responsibility of luggage .
From where one goes by bus reach there , one hour ahead of time .
During routine you should keep special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the chance of getting such a good seat is also with you .
While selecting the seat keep in mind your convenience also .
Behind the seat there is abundance of pimples , but it is not appropriate to read in the front seat .
If you have to go to the urinary bladder again and again then take the last seat , and if you do not like it more then the seat bed on the window will be better for you .
Now it is a very interesting thing .
If you are in a seat to keep your hands on both sides then sit on the last seat and keep your bag on the other side .
If there are not many people in the bus then planning is successful .
If there is a convenience of lodging in the bus then while choosing the seat keep in mind this thing as well because after some time there is difficulty in sitting there .
Inform the bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get information about very important things from them .
It is said that everyone was going out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because if they are comparison then they will not be responsible for it .
Whenever the bus stops then come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can find a place for a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .
It is said that if you do not see Rome in Europe then you will not see anything else .
Rome the capital of Italy , is a glorious city in ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .

If seen in the present situation then the fare for going to Maldives from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees per person .
After this if you stay in the fair then you can get hotels at a little lesser price but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then money will be reduced in the pocket .
Securuz has proved to be very useful here .
Before December in a week from Kochi leechruz Maldives and Colombo started the only cruise of India .
Lui cruise has received a lot of name in the business of European companies and cruise hotels .
Although due to some problems Luis cruise has reduced its service now but it is believed that it starts again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise of approximately 5850 rupees per person in the Luis Cruise ship Aquamerin .
That is , the fare of a person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two elders then the children of 15 years are completely free .
Take only one .
Tea-tiffin , food etc . are available at the rate of cruise .
Every moment is of periodic cycle .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the activities , activities found in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming around in big airplanes suddenly a sea plane will stop before you and you will feel like a sports bomb .
But this twin oteral flane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent in all ways for roaming in archipelago like Maldives .
Walking like a speed boat on water it does not even know when it flies in the air .
On flying completely you will not feel like flying ordinary flights .
Every moment your sight will be seen below the window , in the different kinds of suites of Maldives the smoke of reservoir islands and coral islands in blue colored water .
Everything looks so good .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of them with twenty sea planes .
If you want then you can roam around for about four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour or you can take the entire sea plane for spending your entire day .
Although if you go from the island to the other island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which your mind never feels like finishing .
Sepline travels from 12 kms to 183 kms in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and souvenir shops of the capital of Ahmadabad market of Malaysia .
One day earlier by Maldives President Mahmood Nasheed in Copenhagen the conference given in the environment conservation of the world is being heard with great attention .
Truth is that I have not seen any Indian listening to the conference of Presidents or Prime Ministers so carefully .
But when there are questions of a new creative element on this earth then such seriousness is unparalleled .
Several people considered it unsuccessful in the event of water falling in the Maldives in October but if we go to Maldives then it feels as if the nature oppresses us then how bad the world will get down from us .
There are some such specialities in the beauty there .
Believe that in that small country how much beauty is blended .
To return from that market tour to its cruise while returning towards Jetty when our eyes go towards the water of the sea while moving towards the road then it feels as if the people here can understand the value of these beauty .
The water is so clean that the fish swimming in the depths of several metres below the light of the lappost are seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can see some centimetres of water of sea or river from any city of India completely then you will consider you very lucky .
The evening spent in Malaysia after returning to Aquarius is roaming in the jungle for two hours .
Coral reef is the life here .
Besides this you will also get to see the rocks of the day in the stones situated on the graves .
A few moments before listening to the conference of President Nasheed we were standing outside his government residence .
There is no belief that we are ahead of the highest testimony building of the second country and till some time no one can escape .
We enjoyed walking through the entrance of their building and taking photographs of Vasara and Puducherry located at a distance of about fifty kilometres .
Can you think of any royal family in India like this
It was also known here that President sometimes crossing the road on foot he goes to his office two blocks ahead .
The statue of Maldives was surprising .
That is why I am waiting a lot for the next day .
That is Goddess i . . that day some special incident will not happen .
In the morning a ship from Cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached Maldives by roaming around in the runway .
Earlier in the evening when the cruise reached near Male we immediately remembered the sea plane moving above .
How many photographs he had seen .
But then he could not lose his chance to travel in it the next day .
We had to go to the Rangali island of an hundred and five kilometres through the sea plane of Trace Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see thousands of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from sea plane flying at a height of approximately a thousand kms .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is adventurous to climb while holding the breath loudly with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel in Rangli Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , outside it there is no relation with any country .
Vasta is not like this as well where it is difficult to get out such beauty or luxury .
Walking on Konark is also possible on foot or by vehicles running with battery .
The view of the lifestyle of the tribes on both the sides of the bridge passing through Jetty to the main gate is marvellous .
Now in the natural beauty around us we could not believe us naturally , we reached such a place , it was unbelievable .
With the help of stairs while entering the sea water several metres down we reached the room with glass which was inside the water .
This room is usually a dining room .
We can see all kinds of small and big fishes , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving people .
The imagination of eating while sitting on the chairs decorated there is a lot of thrill for us .
On coming to this island from Malayala Kalagramam the fare of seeing it and running underwater is 47 thousand rupees per person .
Heart did n't feel like returning from there .
We were all ready to dissolve our passports in water .
But we know that this is not that easy .
Without liking this belief once again whenever there is any chance then fortunately brings here for sure .
I was planning to get out of Delhi for several days but work was not possible to go anywhere due to pressure .
Children liked wildlife since childhood , but I thought that this element would go to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 this is the second biographer of Laddakh , from Khardugala to Pegog Lake .
In the month of 27 December we set out for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the excitement that we had left for our excitement was spectacular .
The journey between Howrah and Gajrola is really limited .
Above all roads are smoky and unpopular .
Many times it seemed as if we were lost .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhauli near the park , whose booking we had done before .
On that day there was a special program that we went to roam on the shore of Kosi after getting cold .
After spending two - three hours there we set out for the Corbett Museum , which is at a distance of 2 kms with great difficulty is near the Dhangi Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar situated below .
It is evening for the return .
After deciding from Delhi we definitely saw a lion roaming around in the jungle and in the night I was watching a lion .
At night in the middle of deep sleep suddenly I heard a very big sound and after that the dogs could not start for two hours .
Incidentally the decision to visit Kaladungi and Corbett Fall had come .
Kaladungi is thirty k . . away , that is why Carbot falls on the way .
Kaladungi Jim Corbett is a museum where some special things related to their real life are kept .
It was twelve and a half to come back .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
The journey of reaching the resort Jeepsy is waiting for us .
It was told that they provided the facility of cycling in a suite market there on number one .
When asked about number one then it was said that Grasland was more there and Tiger used to come to that direction to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijarani we gave us a guide , which takes us two hundred and fifty to roam around for four hours .
We set out to go inside the jungle .
We saw many kinds of animals and deer of many species there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which have big teeth .
I took photographs courageously .
In the midst of this the guide started trekking .
The guide said that in the park around 150 tigers , some of them have died today .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but because of not seeing the tigers I was disappointed .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a tiger in my brain .
Then I remembered one of my old friends of Haldani .
I made him a phoon for Sarada .
I told him I was coming to Corbett .
He asked if he had seen tiger or not .
His words reflect me like arrows .
I said gradually , no .
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Who gave us advice that you should take safari inside .
