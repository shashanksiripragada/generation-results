Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Enemy Buddhism Deepjyotiranmostthe
I salute those Divyangjans.
What could be better thoughts to keep in mind this Deepawali, let us pray everywhere to spread light, spread positiveness and destroy the spirit of enmity.
Today Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community are involved in this, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organizations of the country celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way Bharat can be realised there.
Friends, Festivals of tourism in the world used to attract themselves.
Our India, which is a nation of festivals, has great potential for tourism.
Whether it is Holi, Diwali or Onam or Pongal or Bihu, we should try to share with other states and other people in the joy of the festivals by spreading such festivals.
We have so many different festivals in each state and every field - the people of other countries have a lot of interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in enhancing tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, it was decided that something would be expedited in this Diwali.
I used to say, I would like to assure you all that this Diwali, the women's strength of India and the great success achieved by them, that is, India's Lakshmi.
And, immediately after this, there was a lot of inspirational stories in the social media.
Kodepka Ramesh of Warangal wrote on the Namo App that my mother is my strength.
When my lawyers were funded in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today we are among the five brothers of good business.
Ramesh Ji, my best wishes to my parents.
Geetika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, has said that India has laxmi on Major Khushboo Kumbh, who is the daughter of a bus driver and he was led by all the women of Assam Rifles.
For poetry Tiwari ji, India's Lakshmi is her daughter, who is also her strength.
They are proud of their best paintings.
He has also achieved a very good category in the CLAT examination.
Mega Jain has written that a 92-year-old elderly woman provides free water to travellers at Gwalher Railway Station.
Meghazi has been very inspired by the spirit of humility and humility of Laxmi in India.
Many such stories have been told by people.
We must keep that word, inspiration and do some similar things in our surrounding areas.
My best wishes to all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, Sanchi Honuma, the well-known poet of the 17th century, had written a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
The same feeling, the words that we are talking about every Lakshmi in India, the foundation stone was laid in the 17th century.
How beautiful words, how beautiful thoughts and ideas are there in this poem in Kannada.
Our daughters, this is our pride and due to the glory of these legends, our society has a strong identity and the future is bright.
My dear countrymen, 12th November, 2019 is the day the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated across the globe.
Guru Nanak Dev ji's influence is not only in India but in the whole world.
Our top brothers and sisters are present in many countries of the world who are completely dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget my visit to the Gurudwara of Venkuاور and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which I can tell you, but for that there will be many parts of Mann Ki Baat.
He always made the service best.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believes that the service provided by free persons cannot be solved.
He stood firmly against socially bad practices such as unpopularity.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji delivered his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most travellers in our times.
Many places and wherever they went, their direct nature, humility and simplicity grew their minds.
Guru Nanak Dev ji made several important religious visits which were called sadness.
With the message of goodwill and equality, whether north or south, east or west, everywhere, people, saints and sages met.
It is believed that the well-known saint of Assam had also been inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water.
Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, a famous place in Bidar, which reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is dedicated to him.
During a sadness, Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This made a strong relationship between the Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet , from where people considered him a guru .
He is also devoted to Uzbekistan where he had gone.
During one of his sadness, he also visited the Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He was in the hearts of millions of people who followed their teachings and are still doing it.
Just a few days back, the ambassadors of nearly 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and this incident took place on the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these princes had visited the Golden Temple and they had the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After this, several princes put photographs on the social media and wrote proudly about the best experiences.
I wish that the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will give us more inspiration to bring his ideals and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that this date on 31st October will be fixed in memory of all of you.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, who was a great treasure of listening to the country.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to bring people together, while on the other hand, with those who had their ideological differences, he added to them.
Sardar Patel used to go and look at small things too.
The real meaning was the Man of Detals, which led the Tashil.
At the same time, he was skilled in the organisation skills.
Thousands of delegates from across the country had come to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements of the session.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system to the city.
It has been decided that no one will suffer water shortage.
Not only that, he was very surprised to know about the things that Sardar Patel had done in this regard.
He urged the farmers to make khadi pushes.
The farmers made such pushes and sold them to the delegates.
I used to wear my shoes in these pushes and the pressure of the delegates to go to Chapla Chori.
On the other hand, the sale of khadi increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a remarkable role in the Convention.
He made important efforts to ensure basic rights so that there was no discrimination on the basis of caste and creed.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great and historical work to unite the institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai was the only feature that he looked at every moment.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patels efforts, there was talk of their geography about some special states in the unity of the country.
He told the Mudaliar brother, Archot Ramswamy Mudaliyar and Archot Laxmanswamy Mudaliyar that they should take the people of Travancore quickly and push the tricolor there.
The tricolor was hoisted immediately after his order and the neighbouring country's mindset to gain control over Lakshadweep was destroyed.
After this incident, Sardar Patel said that Lakshadweep will get every necessary support for development, he added.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the progress of India.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I am confident that we will visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, the foundation stone of the unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world on 31st October, 2018.
This is the highest effigy in the world.
The height of the statue of freedom fighters in America is double.
The highest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
The dignity of each Indian was strong.
You will be happy that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the effigy of unity.
This means that every day about six and a half thousand people see the grandeur of unity.
He expressed his beliefs and devotion towards Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now many attraction centres such as the Electricity Garden, Floriculture Park, Forest Safari, Children's Nutritious Diet Park, Ekta Nursery are continuously developing and it is getting a boost to the local economy and people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Keeping in mind the convenience of tourists, people of several villages are providing such facilities in their homes and homesteads.
Business training is also being provided to those who provide home-stay facilities at home.
I am confident that the people there have started the farming of dragon fruits and soon it will be the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, the effigy of unity can be a subject of practice.
We all are witness to the development of a place, a world famous tourist destination in a year.
There people from all over the country and abroad come.
Several systems like transport, stopping, guides, environmental supplementary systems have been developing one after another.
There is a huge economic development and people are facilitating the needs of the passengers.
The government has lost its role.
Friends, In the last month, Time Measuring has made this place a puppet of unity among the 100 important tourist destinations in the world.
I am hopeful that we all have to take some time from our valuable time to see the effigy of unity.
But I would like to assure you that every Indian who takes the time to travel with the families of at least 15 tourist destinations in India, wherever he goes to stay at night.
Friends, As you know, from 2014 every year 31st October is celebrated as National Integration Day.
This day instructs us to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country by giving us any price.
On 31st October, every year, the run-for-Unity unity day is being organized.
It will include people from every section and every level of society.
The run-for-Unity shows that this country is one and is moving towards one side and looking at achieving a goal.
Yet, nowadays, there is a text and wed about marathon in the people.
The run-for-Unity is also like this.
We have to run here, for Fit India, and for accompanied by an India-Senior India.
And this is not only the body but also the mind and culture to take India to a new height for the unity of India.
For this, we can get information about the run-for-Unity around the city where we live.
In this portal, we have informed about the places where run-for-Unity will be organised across the country.
We will all run on 31st October - for the unity of India, for the sake of ourselves.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country in the throne of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a version in our lives and we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, every stage, every stage, every stage and every stage in a diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to empower the unity and understanding of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September, 2019, when the Allahabad High Court had finished his duties at Ram Janmabhoomi.
Just remember that day, how was the atmosphere
How many people had come to the ground.
How the interest groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation.
What kind of language used to be used to keep the environment warm.
Efforts were also made to fill the tactics in different voices.
On the one hand, there was a lot of humiliation for the atmosphere of two weeks, but when Ram came to the birthplace, the government, the political party, the social organisation, the civil society, the representatives of all the sects, the sadhu santaani gave a very comfortable response.
Efforts to reduce environmental tensions.
But I still remember that day.
These things should always be remembered and they give us a lot of strength.
This is an example of how powerful the voice of unity gives to the country.
My dear countrymen, our Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed on 31st October.
I also pay my tributes to the country.
My dear countrymen, today a story is being heard from a remote village in every corner of India, from north to south, east to west and from every corner of India, it is cleanliness.
Every person, every family, every village has to tell their pleasant experiences about cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is an attempt of 1. 25 billion Indians.
The merchants are also 125 crore Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience.
I have heard and I think I should tell you as well.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature falls from zero to 50 degrees.
Physiotherapy occurs in the air only by the name .
In such a difficult situation, staying in such challenges is also not less than parallel.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are protecting the borders of the country by pressing their chest, but they are running a clean Siachen campaign.
I congratulate the people of the country for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my thanks.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to get some disturbances.
In such a situation, dissolution and management of waste is an important task.
In such a situation, 130 tons of waste from the glacier and its surrounding areas and that too, in such a delicate environment, how large is this service.
Everyone knows that Siachen is a part that is the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the cleanliness drive here means to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower part and use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shauk.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a new sensitivity in our lives.
And in Diwali, especially in every family, some or the other thing is being purchased from the market.
As much as we try to buy local goods, Gandhi 150 will be a great opportunity.
And I am glad that we should buy something that is made of the hand of our mines and the hand of our mines.
In this Diwali, we must have purchased a lot before Diwali.
But there will be a lot of people who are thinking that if they go after Diwali then they will get a little cheaper.
There will be a number of people who have been buying more.
I would like to invite you to buy local goods, if we are going forward for the purchase of local goods.
The dreams of Mahatma Gandhi can play an important role.
But sometimes there is a fire because of ignorance.
There were wounds.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, whether it is any region, caste, religion, religion or language, is always ready to express his joy and relentlessness to our soldiers.
Yesterday, India's 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated Parikram Parv.
We recalled the differences in the goals made in 2016 when our soldiers responded sufficiently to those who fought against terrorism.
In different parts of the country, our armed battalions and exhibitions have been exhibited so that most of the citizens of the country, especially the youngsters can understand their potential.
We can know how we are capable and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by using their lives.
A day like Parakarma Parv reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of their armed forces and inspires us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also attended a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of Shurrvira.
It is certain that our soldiers will respond to those who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We are committed to encouraging our belief in peace and to encourage it, but not by paying honour and by paying the price of the country's honour.
India has always been committed and devoted to peace.
This was a pilgrimage by our soldiers towards peace.
Even today, India is one of the fastest growing countries in the United Nations in different peacekeeping sessions.
Over the decades, our soldiers have played an important role in bringing peace to the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, the story of the sky is different.
One of the interests of the people in the Republic Day programme is the Fly Paste, in which our air force shows the synergy of our strength by directing the air connectivity.
On 8th October, we celebrate the Air Force Day.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Force personnel and their families who serve the country.
In 1947, when the Pakistani delegation launched an indirect attack, the Air Force expressed its appreciation that Indian troops and materials would reach the battlefield to protect Srinagar.
The air force responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who knows the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1971
Air Force has played an important role in liberating Kargil from horse riding in 1999.
The air force smoked them on the Tiger Hill at the enemy's shelters.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful to the best efforts of these warriors of our Air Force.
Their task is to tackle the natural calamities and help the countrymen from Wattal, Pur and the forest fires.
In order to ensure the equality of men and women in the country, the air force has created ideals and they have opened the doors of each of our departments for girls.
Now, the Air Force is giving the option of 'Sourt Service Commission' as well as 'Parmant Commission' which I had announced on August 15 this year from the Red Fort.
India can be proud of the fact that in our armed forces, as well as the role of women power is happening.
Women are strong and now they are getting cheaper.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our officers of the Navy was bowing down tommy, life and death.
The whole country was worried about how to save them.
We all know that Abhilash Tommy is a brave hero.
He is the first Indian official to travel to the world by taking a small name from any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, in South Indian Ocean, in the Golden Global Race, he used to sustain his speed in the sea, but the terrible maritime thunderstorms created a crisis against them, but the Indian Navy's heroes continued to shout in the sea for several days.
I pray for the better health of Abhilash Tommy and that is why it will inspire the young generation of our country to live with courage, courage, determination and determination.
My dear countrymen, the small children also know what is important for our country on 2nd October.
There is another special significance on 2nd October this year.
Two years from now, we will organize several programmes across the globe on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The ideas of Mahatma Gandhi inspired the entire world.
Great scientists like Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, who have gained strength from Gandhi's ideas and have been able to give a long fight to give us the right to equality and dignity.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss another important task of my devoted Bapu, which more and more people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, he insisted on the freedom struggle in 1945, and made it a correction of these ideas.
Our thoughts were made to the people of the country on the issues such as the protection of the rights of the farmers, the village, the rights of the workers, cleanliness, the spread of education.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Popular Bapu was a collection.
It was the habit of the fathers to connect and mix people with them.
Everyone had never experienced this unique feature.
He gave everybody the experience that the person is the most important and most important for the country.
The biggest contribution to the freedom struggle is that they have given this fight the form of mass movement.
In the movement of freedom struggle, every section of the society, every section of the society, resisted Mahatma Gandhis inspiration.
Bapu had given you an inspirational mantra.
So he can overcome his life and part..
This will provide voice to millions of people, those who are hungry and their souls are unhappy...
Then you will find that your doubts have started decreasing and the ego is ending.
My dear countrymen, a mantra of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the middle class is growing in the country, can we remember the growing economic strength, rising purchase power and buying something
Whoever is fortunate, whose purchase will benefit directly or indirectly.
I will be more happy if the poor people are benefitted.
Keeping in mind the mantra of Gandhi Ji, while celebrating Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary in the coming days, we must pay attention to the fact that some country should be built due to our purchases and those who have lost their sweat, their money and their talent should be benefited in some form or the other.
This is Gandhijis mantra, this is Gandhijis message and I am confident that this small step in the life of the poorest and the weakest person can transform.
But this was achieved, India got freedom.
Similarly, today we can feel that my small work can also contribute to the economic progress and economic empowerment of my country and strengthening the poor to fight against poverty.
In today's era, this is the true patriotism, this is the very privilege of Bapu.
He said that all these Khadi clothing have been made very carefully and every thread should be used.
The spirit of self-sufficiency and affection towards the people of the country was distinguished from the glory of this childhood.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientists.
The name of Scientists glows in the hearts of our Indians.
Their rich personality is always proud of every Indian.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he was very humble from outside but he was determined by the heart.
The announcement of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is an integral part of his distinguished personality.
It was the result of his unhealthy devotion to the nation that during the nearly one and a half years of work, he gave a mantra to the young and farmers of the country to reach the peak of success.
My dear countrymen, today we are reminding the devotee of Bapu, but it is natural that you will not be able to talk about cleanliness.
Swachhata Hi Seva Abhiyan was launched from 15th September.
Millions and millions of people participated in it and I am fortunate to be working with the students of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation stone was laid by Puja Babasaheb.
People from all over the country participated in the 15th episode.
The institution also participated in it.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSS, Youth Organisations, Broadcasting Media Groups, Private Industry, all of them worked very hard.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all this cleanliness lover.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but in the entire world, about which everybody is talking.
At present, India is organising the largest global cleaning summit in history, Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness summit, Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Cleanliness Ministers and experts from all over the world are combined with their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded on 2nd October, 2018 with the launch of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit: "Najul Swaraj Sat" is justified by the roots of Swaraj, when there is a discussion of justice, the spirit of human rights is inherent in it.
It is especially necessary to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited and deprived people.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's Constitution provides for the protection of the basic rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established by National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on 12th October, 1993, inspired by its perspective.
NHRC will complete 25 years in a few days.
NHRC has worked to enhance human dignity along with the protection of human rights.
Our dear leader, the country's great Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made it clear that human rights is not a personal concept for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, all the Buildings of the Vedic times are engraved.
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
In this 25-year journey, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and trust among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a hopeful thing for a healthy society and for a better democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the National Level Human Rights Act.
It is the foundation of Sabka Saath, SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas.
This year too, we will try to organize the Run for Unity in our villages, towns and cities.
Daud is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb for unity because he worked for unity throughout his life.
I urge you all that on 31st October, through the Run for Unity, every section of the society and every part of the country to enhance our efforts in the field of unity will be the best tribute to them.
My dear countrymen, my heartiest congratulations to all of you for the sacred festival of Navaratri, Durga Puja and Vijaya Dashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today Rakhi Purnima is being celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this holy day.
This festival is celebrated as a symbol of love and trust between the daughters and brothers.
Janmashtami will be celebrated soon.
The climate of the sympathies like Hathi, horse, palki-Jai Kanhaiyalal, Govinda-Govinda are going to be overwhelmed.
The joy of being colored in the color of Lord Krishna is very sweet .
Sir, Adi Sanskrit - Dinmasti.
Sanskrit languages, Sarla etc.
Brothers and sisters, along with Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
At the same time, we are also proud to have played a very important role in spreading knowledge through Sanskrit language since the Vedas.
In Sanskrit language and literature, knowledge about every field of life is as if it is a treasure.
Not only this, it is also stated that in Sanskrit language, the mantras that give a broader answer to the challenges of the global temperament.
You all will be happy to know that the people of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka still use Sanskrit language.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit language can create innumerable words in this language.
What is the importance of Guruchin in life , it is said in the supramental language that one is Akshakramasthu , Guru : the disciples are in Prabodhya .
My dear countrymen, the monsoon rains are bringing new hopes for our farmers who work hard and hard work.
This rain provides to sand and dried trees and plants and stagnant reservoirs due to extreme heat.
But sometimes it brings extremely destructive, catastrophic Mahapur.
In comparison to other places in the country, there has been heavy rainfall.
I pray that those who are injured in this natural calamity will improve their nature at the earliest.
But even during such a crisis, we see humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari everybody helps those who are at their own level, whether it is in Kerala or in any other district in India.
He made tireless efforts to save the lives of people trapped in Pura.
Whether it is the air force or the ship or the army, the Border Security Force, the CISF, the RAF and the army have played a very important role in the rescue and relief work.
In this sacred period of Onam, we pray that the country, especially Kerala, should be able to get the power to get out of this crisis as soon as possible and the developmental journey of Kerala should get a good momentum.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I once again want to assure the people of Kerala and those places where such a crisis has emerged across the country that the entire country is with us during such a crisis.
For the last ten years, he had gone far away from active politics.
But after August 16, the country and the world saw that even after this 10 years of age, there was immense affection for Atal ji in the minds of the common man of India.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Reforms Act, 2003.
This change brought about two important changes in the governance of India.
First of all, the size of the State Cabinet was limited to 15 percent of the total Legislative Assemblies.
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-party law was one-third, it was increased to two-thirds.
A clear direction has also been made to ensure that the members of the participants are eligible.
Atal ji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the country's economy was changed to the House.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time to ask for a budget in the Parliament and made an announcement in the morning.
Some of the regulations in this collaboration have made it possible to unleash the Tricolor at public places.
Therefore, more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flags.
Atal ji has done a great job to bring our favourite tricolor closer to the people.
Anyone is opponent in this regard and people are seeking their opinions.
I salute Atal ji, all of you, by reviving the resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 percent and the Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
The Act will further protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court here in Katni, Madhya Pradesh gave only five days of hearing and sentenced the sinners to blame.
Similarly, in Rajasthan, in the courts there have been decisions on the facts of women's atrocities.
The Act will play an effective role in curbing the atrocities against women and children.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
In this monsoon session of Parliament, all the members have contributed together with an ideal composition.
For this, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the dignitaries of the country at the public level.
My dear countrymen, the attention of millions of Indians is being paid to the Asian Sports Competitions.
The Asian sports are still in progress.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
The number of medal winners for the country has increased, particularly those who have been involved in it are positive signs.
Keep in mind your sensitivity because only a healthy and healthy country can create a prosperous and prosperous India.
Namaste Bhaiji, I respect my feelings.
Everyone is surprised to see the ueen Ki Baw built in the eleventh century in Patna in Gujarat.
India's land means engineering as if laboratory had to be said.
Many of the Indian engineers have shown that they can only imagine it.
This kind of blood has been found in our tradition that tells the legacy of great engineers.
This blood is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Vishweshwaraiah.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the Kaveri river is still benefitting millions of farmers and the people.
In Kutch it is called Bhunga.
My houses have seen 3-3 earthquakes.
I have experienced three earthquakes in this house myself.
But go inside and see, you don't see any losses.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature, the geographical structure and the environment here.
After seeing the house, I thought that even before several times, the engineers of that period had thought of the local situation and built their houses in accordance with the local situation, which would ensure that the people could be safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also think about the future.
The workshop should be taken at places.
What new things should we learn during the changing times
Which things should be taught to people
How should we connect
Nowadays, disaster management has been a big task.
The entire world has to face natural calamities.
How can we have a new form of structural engineering
How will its different practices be
What should the students learn in this
Many such things should be discussed at the time when the Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of celebrations.
Besides, preparations for Diwali are also going to be started.
In Mann Ki Baat, we will continue to meet and talk about our hearts.
At the same time, we are working to move our country with all our hearts.
With this feeling, my best wishes to all of you.
Some people are still waiting for Varunraj.
India is huge and there is diversity in it, but sometimes Varunraj in this country also shows the form of our love and affection.
In such a situation, the most important responsibility is that we all should be nature-loving, nature-loving and nature-loving.
If we become nature then the balance of natural things will be maintained automatically.
We must have seen this incident on the television.
Actually it takes usually a few hours to go and return to that cave .
After remembering that it is not coming out, these children took shelter at a slight altitude in the middle of the cave.
But they didn't have anything for one or two days, but the tabble started stopping within 18 days.
We can now imagine how their moments and moments have come in the mindset when they are facing direct death.
On the one hand, these children were bowing their hands with the crisis and on the other hand, humanity across the globe was simultaneously reflecting human qualities throughout the world.
Especially after seeing everybodys extremely restraint behavior, I feel that this is a learning quality of understanding.
Those whose daughters were stuck inside, their parents were not suffering or even they were not suffering from misery.
But patience, patience and peaceful behavior made by the entire society, this is a very important thing that we all have to learn.
A young man from Thailand had to lose his life in the entire team of cooperation.
These young people showed the valour of patience and patience to help in the cave in a very difficult situation filled with water and darkness.
It has shown that when humanity is united, such a wonderful thing happens.
But for that only we need to work peaceful and stable minds and focus on those things for which we are working.
A few days ago, the poet Neeraj ji of our country left us forever.
Neeraj ji was a special feature here.
He believed in hope, belief and determination.
Everything of Neeraj ji can be very inspiring and powerful to all Indians.
Similarly, the month of July and August is very important for the farmers brothers and all the youngsters.
Because there is a problem of entering colleges during this period.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam come out of school life and enter the college.
Young people are walking on a new path in life, so our focus comes out of the question and comes up with a cut-off.
The attention of the students is now taken from home to the house.
Students have come out of the roof of their parents and have come under the roof of the professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about the beginning of the college life.
For the first time, you should leave the house and leave the village and leave the village and get out of a safe environment and yourself will have to be the sarthi.
Many young people have to leave their homes for the first time to give a different and new direction to their lives.
I want to tell you all that be quiet and enjoy this life.
You have to practice but the natural eagerness to find out new things while learning should remain in you.
Old friends are a special turn.
I was watching the news of how ASHARAM Chaudhari, a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, faced a lot of problems in life.
The admission test of MBBS for ASHARM Jodhpur has been inaugurated in the first attempt.
Anushka Panda, the disabled man of Gurgaon, is suffering from a hereditary disease of Spanish muscular atrophy.
All of them have worked hard to keep looking at every problem faced by their determination and determination.
If we look at it, we will see many such examples.
Any good incident that took place in any part of the country, is giving energy to my heart.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes fell on a news sheet, in which two youths had fulfilled this dream of Modi.
When the news was read, it was reported that today how our youngsters use technology in smart and creative ways and how to transform the lives of the common man.
The incident was that San Jose city of America was considered a hub of technology. Once I was talking to Indian youth there.
At that time I requested them to consider how you can use the intelligence and princely state for your country and make a few new decisions.
I used to invite that the problem of brain-drain can be solved by brain-gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, accepted this request and brought an innovative call.
Using our professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly created a 'Smartgaon App'.
This app cannot only connect the people of the village with the entire world, but through this app, any information and information can be found on your mobile phone.
The people of Thoudakpur village in Rae Bareli, the village chief-serviceman, the district magistrate, the chief district officer, all of them have created awareness among the people to use this app.
You say that this is a wonderful journey of Pandharpur.
Friends, This year, Ashadi Academy was held on 23rd July and on this day, the festival of Vari is celebrated with devotion.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Sat Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, the great saints like Sat Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram roam in Palakhi and roam the name of Vithal and walk on foot towards Pandharpur.
Vithal , which is also called Vithoba or Pandurang , reaches Pandharpur for their views .
Vithal is a deity that protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
In Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, there is immense devotion and devotion to the people of Panduranga.
Go to the temple of Vithoba of Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
It has been given an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood in the literature of these saints.
These saints gave the mantra of strengthening the society against blindness.
And he also empowered the people to empower the old people from the society, and the culture of compassion, equality and goodwill.
Lokmanya Tilak was a sea of courage and self-confidence.
In 20 years, the British tried their best to prove the insolvency of the treason thrice.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I want to tell the people of the country about the dazzling event of his effigy in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
During that period, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad for their warm welcome and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had got the opportunity to discuss with Tilak.
In this meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak were extremely impressed by their personality and thoughts.
Lokmanya Tilak was killed on August 1, 1920, after which Patel decided to build a memorial at Tilak in Ahmedabad.
On 28th February, 1929, Sardar Saheb inaugurated this memorial, not by anyone else, but by Mahatma Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, one more thing says that this statue is also very rare and it has been written that Lokmanya Tilak has settled on a chair, along with Tilak is the 'Savraj Our Birth Anniversary Hai'.
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium to create a sense of harmony and equality among the people with traditional faith and devotion.
In such a situation, there was a need to fight against the British in that particular period.
And because of the festivals launched by Tilak, they used to work together by breaking the walls of the community.
The popularity of organizing all these festivals in the Ogha of the period is increasing, it is also seen that even today's young generation is very attractive to the heroes of our ancient traditions and history.
Today in many cities, the pavilions of Ganesh Festivals are seen in almost every streets.
Every family in the street organizes the Ganapati Festival together.
Even here, our youngsters get good opportunities, their leadership, festival organizers, programme organizers, coordinators can grow.
There should be some environmental affection from the statue of Ganesh ji to the luggage of decoration.
Today, every Indian needs good governance and development.
I talk about Chandrasekhar Azad.
Azad bowed down to his life, but he never bowed down to foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit the village of Alirajpur, Madhya Pradesh in Chandrasekhar Azad.
I got the opportunity to pay homage to Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, as if Chandrashekhar Azad had not even wanted to die by foreign pills, had promised that he would continue fighting till the end of his life and sacrificed his life.
This was one of their characteristics.
Once again I salute these two great sons of Bharat Mata - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days back, India's legendary daughter and daughter of a landlord, Hima Das, has won a new history by winning a gold medal in the 400-meter race of the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, has sent me an e-mail from Indonesia as an answer to my letter and today the unity is creating an Asian Sports Competition.
It is written in our e-mail that the most important moment in the life of an athlete is that when the player holds the tricolor in his hand.
You all are proud of unity.
We are proud of you for brightening the name of our country.
The World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 has won solitary Gold and Silver Medals in Tunisia.
We should move ahead like this, keep on playing and developing.
My dear countrymen, several historic events have taken place in August and various festivals also come in this month, but during the monsoon season, diseases are also entering the house for some time.
Once again, I would like to visit Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, I once again got the opportunity to interact with you through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Just a few days back, a historic meeting of cricket was held in Bangalore.
I would like to tell you about the Cricket Castes between India and Afghanistan.
In this meeting, both the Unions witnessed a very good sports event.
Rashid Khan, a Golden Jubilee from Afghanistan, had done a great job in the IPL this year.
I express my gratitude to my Indian friends for providing a platform for showing their skills to our sportspersons.
The best and best representatives in Afghanistan will be recommended.
We have come to know about the sportspersons, how to play and how to play.
Sports is a very good medium to unite the society and to show skills and talent among our youth.
My best wishes to both the Unions of India and Afghanistan.
Even so, I hope that we continue to play and develop amongst each other in performing similar players.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, that is, the fourth Yoga Day was a different vision.
Be it the European Parliament, the United Nations, the headquarters of New York, or the fighter ship of Japanese Navy, people were seen doing yoga all over the world.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic programme on Yoga and I got to know that women had done the guidance for several seats.
The soldiers of India and China jointly performed Yoga at the high altitude Snow Summit in Ladakh.
We are working to bridge the boundaries and connect everyone.
Thousands of enthusiastic people of hundreds of countries have celebrated Yoga Day by going beyond such discrimination, religion, region, color or sex.
If people from all over the world were participating in the programmes of Yoga Day so enthusiastically, then in such a situation, there will not be any excitement of their cact in India.
Yoga has been practiced at three places like Jawans, Siddhas, Navals and HawaiiDals of our country.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga on Panbudi.
While some soldiers performed yoga on the snowy hills of Siachen.
The warriors of our Air Force were surprised by the warriors and by doing yoga in the sky at a height of 15000 feet from the Earth.
It is important to say that they did not practice yoga while sitting in the air, they used to do yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, Yoga has been practiced all around.
Yoga has worked to collect people from all over the world by crossing the geographical boundaries of castes and geographical boundaries, since ancient times, we have been living in the minds of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sage, Muni and Saint have always emphasized this idea.
Today, Yoga has been proved by the means.
Today, welness is working in revolution.
We see mother as god, mother gives birth to us, so we consider her as gods and this is our culture.
Sometimes doctors give us reproduction.
The role of the doctor is not limited to medication only.
There is a lot of experience in the doctors who have medical knowledge and how their lifestyle should be improved and how their health has a good experience.
Indian doctors have shown their innumerable capabilities and skills and have created their own unique and independent identity throughout the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctors on the sidelines of the Doctors Day on 1st July.
India has a rich history.
Gujarat's Kabirwad will be very comfortable for us, while I used to work in Gujarat, a large national session was held by the people of the tradition of Saint Kabir.
Everyone knows that the village of Maghar in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh had confessed by Saint Kabirdas.
But is it sure that Kabirdas ji chose the same place as Maghar to take a pillar
At that time it was believed that those who died here were not found in heaven.
On the contrary, those who sacrifice in Kashi go to heaven.
Maghar was considered a defiant place but Saint Kabirdas had no faith in such things.
Saint Kabir Das emphasized on social equality, peace and brotherhood through Sakia and both.
This was their ideal.
We see this ideal from their creations.
The meaning of this thing is that those who understand the sufferings of others are true fakirs and saints.
And those who do not know the sufferings of others are indefinite.
Kabir Das Ji had given special emphasis on social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time.
The knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and they should be respected.
However, even today, the things that Kabir said are equally effective.
Today, when we read Kabir ji's words, we feel that this is what we are talking about today's knowledge age.
We know that their ideas are relevant even today.
Now we are talking about Saint Kabirdas Ji. In such a situation, I remember one of his two brothers.
There is a great guru, Jagatguru-Guru Nanak Dev.
He has shown glory to millions of people and has been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanak Dev said that the service of the poor and the needy is to serve God.
He worked for the betterment of society wherever he went.
He brought a social distinction-free kitchen system and the people of any ethnicity, religion and sect can come and eat food and Guru Nanak Dev started the method of lungar.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji will be celebrated in 2019.
The horrific events at Jallianwala Bagh will be completed in 2019, which will surpass the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifices are always won.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjees Jayanti and in today's programme, I congratulate Dr.
During 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee also played a very important role.
He was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Come on, then, we are all, Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
It can be said that by going across the files, they got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of people.
In remote villages, the youngsters are providing service coverage through Common Service Centre till the retirement of the elderly in the villages becomes transparent.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister used to collect steel and make her ice-cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youths of the country are providing medicines at affordable rates by running the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and going to nearby villages.
I am extremely happy that the success of the common man is more than the success of the government in this entire programme.
In such a disappointing environment, the government cannot give credit to the hopes, new enthusiasm and the events that have taken place in the lives of the common man.
The incident of small girl childhood in a small village in remote and remote areas also proves to be inspirational to 1.
With the help of technology for me, a moment spent with the beneficiaries through video bridge has become very happy and inspiring.
In a way, a new joy, a new zeal and a new inspiration can be achieved for the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people attended the Video Bridge program and they worked to give me a new boost.
I once again express my gratitude for this.
On the one hand, there are professionals and technologists and on the other hand, our farmers are brothers and sisters working in the fields.
Now we will also think that both agriculture and technology are very different businesses and what is their relationship
The schemes have been started and their successful efforts have been made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, from the production of crops to its marketing, the role of farmers is important, while on the other hand, efforts are also made to ensure the participation of the farmers.
Friends
This work we have done in youth is inspiring the youngsters.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
If one national, one tax reforms have to be given the highest credit then I will give it to the states.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example in which all the States decided together for the country and thereafter, tax reforms in such a wide range of countries were possible.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Summit have been held and people with different political considerations come together.
Before GST, there were 17 types of tax systems in the country but now the new system has been implemented in the entire country.
GST is a victory of authenticity and it is also a festival of authenticity.
Earlier, there were complaints about Inspector Raj in taxation processes.
GST, perhaps the biggest tax reform in the world.
Generally, it would have been possible to take a period of 5 to 7 years to improve such a huge public relations and to ensure that the entire scheme is fully stable.
The 21st National Sports Competition was held in Australia recently from 4th April to 15th April.
And when there is an atmosphere of enthusiasm, excitement, zeal, hope, aspirations and determination to do something then who can remain unsuccessful.
This was the time when people from all over the country had to think that today any player is going to play.
How can India work, how many medals we can win and all this was very natural.
Our sportspersons also performed well in fulfilling the expectations of the countrymen and won a medal in a lesson.
Whether it is nembaji, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton India has done the best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze - India has earned a total of 66 medals.
Every Indian is proud of this success.
Medal wins is a matter of pride and joy for every player.
This is a moment of great pride for all the countrymen and all the countrymen.
Perhaps my words will come down to express that feeling.
But I want to tell you what I have heard from this player.
For this reason, there were several such things that had happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won medals in all the competitions.
He is the first Indian female player to win Indias first gold medal in the personal table tennis competition.
India got the highest medal in the world.
The 15-year-old Indian sportsperson, Anish Bhav, became the youngest sportsperson to win the Gold medal in the national competition.
Sachin Chaudhari, who won medals at the National Sports Competition, is the only Indian Para Power Lifter.
The sports competition was also special because most of these female players were medal winners.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting or nembaji, women sportspersons have performed well.
Everyone was eager to fight and both the medals were available to India.
The sportspersons who participated in the competition had come from different parts of the country, from small towns.
Their friends also contribute, who have enhanced their mindset in every situation.
In Mann Ki Baat last month, I had invited the countrymen, especially our youngsters, to Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India and represent Fit India.
And I am glad that people are joining it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have written their letters and have sent letters and have shared their health singings on social media.
A household Shasikanta Bhosle has shirt his pictures in the watershed - My weapon is my body, my delegation is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I am happy and healthy due to Morning Walk.
And they further say - for me-fitness games with a small and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that God Nath ji is healthy in happiness.
Dhawal Prajapati, while sharing his photograph of the trekking, wrote, "Triving and trekking for me is the Fit India.
I am very pleased to see that many well-known people are encouraging their youngsters to fit India in an extremely attractive manner.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Some youngsters have shared their experiences while participating in Fit India.
I believe that such movements are extremely beneficial for all of us and for all of us.
And I will definitely say that the name of the Fit India movement is Yoga without spending any money.
The importance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June is now adopted by the entire world.
You will also be ready.
Your city, your village, your department, your school, your college, every person of any age or woman should try to participate in Yoga.
Today I want to talk to you to invite you for a new work and I have seen that many young people are learning something new this time.
My young friends, I urge you to join a special internship.
Whether it is the three ministries of the Government of India, manpower development or the Department of Drinking Water, three-four Ministries of the Government have jointly launched Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Students from college, NCC youth, NSS youth, Nehru Yuva Kendra, who want to be involved in transforming society.
With a positive energy, it is an opportunity for everyone to do something in the society and it will also strengthen cleanliness and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will get the pleasure of doing something before and I also say that the best trainees who have done good work in the college and have done well in the universities.
Moreover, the UGC will also provide two credit points to those academics who complete this.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of this internship.
You can register on MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I am confident that our youngsters will definitely succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Use these holidays as an opportunity to experience a new experience.
This group of youngsters has launched a big campaign for the education of children living in roads and huts.
Initially, the situation of children who have been demanding a buck on the roads or doing small jobs left them so healthy that they blew up their lives in this work.
The scheme, which started from 15 children from Gita Colony, near Jordan, Delhi, has now reached 2,000 children from 12 places in the capital.
The youngsters and teachers associated with this campaign have participated in this brave efforts to make social changes by taking two hours from their working days.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have been inspired by the farmers across the country.
He has not only changed his fate but also his fate.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, mainly Mandwa, Chaulai, Maka or Java are picked up.
They started making biscuits from these crops and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative institution in Munnar village and the factory has been opened to build biscuits there.
Taking into account the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual increase in the institution has not only increased to Rs. 10 to 15 lakh but more than 900 families have also lost their lives due to employment opportunities.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be war for water in the world in the future.
Everyone talks about this, but isn't it our responsibility
Do you not think water conservation should be a social responsibility
Every person should be responsible.
Over the centuries our ancestors have shown this.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
He has also discovered new solutions to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamilnadu may have been the first to write a large number of inscriptions in some temples of Tamilnadu on the occasion of irrigation system, water conservation system and evil management.
Be it Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will get to see a large number of inscriptions everywhere.
Even today, various visitors are popular as tourist destinations, but we do not forget that these are the live proofs of the water conservation campaign of our ancestors.
In Gujarat, Adlaj and Patna's Rani Vihar are the world heritage of UNESCO and their grandeur is worth seeing.
Vihiri is a type of water temple .
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely go to see the moonlight in Jodhpur .
This is Indias largest and well-known wheeler and the most important thing is that in the area where water is deficient.
April, May, June and July are the days when there is an excellent opportunity to store rain water and if we are ready earlier, we will get the same much benefit.
MNREGA funds are also used for this water conservation.
In the last three years, everybody has tried their own way towards water conservation and water conservation.
Every year, apart from MNREGA funds, Rs. 32 thousand crore has been spent on water conservation and water management.
If we talk about 2017-18, 55 of the total expenditure of 64 thousand crore rupees has been spent for water conservation.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by such water conservation and water conservation measures.
Under MNREGA, district administration has taken responsibility for land and water conservation in large quantities.
With the help of about 40 to 45 villages, Sasur Khadri has revived the dried rivers.
Whether it is animals or birds or farmers or farmers or villages, this is a big achievement.
I say that once again we are in front of you, we should take some responsibility for water conservation and water conservation, we should also prepare some schemes and we will do something.
When Mann Ki Baat is there, I get messages from all around, letters come and the phones come.
IN Kumar Banerjee, Devitola village of North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, has written on MyGov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many do not know the technologies of the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore quietly, beautifully and deliberately.
Please discuss this in the Mann Ki Baat programme, that is, people will get information about it.
I express my gratitude to Ayen ji that he attracted the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was an individual full of knowledge and wisdom, whose writings have raised a stance on all.
Rabindranath was a sympathetic, multi-dimensional person, but he used to be a teacher every moment.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Sangeet at the radio in the morning and when I had the opportunity to listen to Anandloke and Agunar, Poreshmani, I got a new innovation.
You must have also demonstrated Rabindra Sangeet and his poets.
I pay tributes to Rabindranath Thakur.
Just a few days later, the holy month of Ramadan will start.
The month of Ramadan is celebrated with full respect and respect throughout the world.
The collective purpose of the day is that when a person is hungry himself, he also feels the hungryness of others.
When he feels himself thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammed.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a person asked the prophets: What is the best thing in Islam
The Prophet Saheb said, Giving food to the poor and the needy and considering each one, whether you know them or not.
Mohammad was confident of his knowledge and compassion.
They have no ego of anything.
He said that egoism only serves knowledge.
Mohammed, who was present, believed that a person is not because of this wealth but because of his sacred soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who has shown the power to perform compassion, service and sacrifice, who has guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds Lord Buddha of the responsibility of following the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspirational force of equality, peace, unity and brotherhood.
These are human values which are the most needed in today's world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar emphasized that his social philosophy has a great inspiration for Lord Buddha.
Babasaheb has strengthened the millions of people, whether they are oppressed, exploited or deprived.
It cannot be a great example of doing business.
To understand the sufferings of the people, the compassion of Lord Buddha was one of the greatest qualities.
It is said that Buddhist monks traveled to different countries and they took the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha along with them and always used to happen.
In the entire Asia, there is a wealth of teachings of Lord Buddha.
In many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings have been deepened and therefore we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect the important Buddhist sites of Southeast Asia with India.
I am happy that the Government of India is a partner in revival of several Buddhist temples, including the beautiful Anand Temple of Bagan in Myanmar hundreds of years ago.
Today, there is a concentration and human suffering everywhere in the world and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the path to end the grief.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to all those who believe in the principles of compassion, who believe in Lord Buddha all over the world.
For the entire world, we seek blessings from Lord Buddha so that we can fulfill our responsibility for creating a peaceful and pathetic world based on their teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, it is believed that Lafing Buddha brings good luck, but very few people know that Smyling Buddha is also associated with an important destination in Indias preservation history.
Now you are wondering what is the connection between Smyling Buddha and the Indian Army
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1998, Peramuna test was conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan.
The event is being completed for 20 years and this test was conducted on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias tests have been successful and thus India has shown its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked in the history of India as its luxury power.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that inner strength is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when we become strong as a country, we ask each one peacefully.
In the month of May, 1998, nuclear tests were conducted so that not only this month is not important for the country but how these tests have been done.
This demolition has shown to the entire world that Indias land is the land of great scientists and India can achieve new heights with a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Jai-Vikasan.
When we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the day of 11th May, 1998, every young man will contribute to the creation of a powerful India, to build a modern India by inspiring the mantra of Jai Vigyan for the strength of India.
Participate your strength in the strength of India.
We can also achieve a new joy and a new solution to the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, visit the next Mann Ki Baat programme and take a dig at the same time.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the sacred festival of Ramnavami.
Just a few days back when all the leaders of the ASEAN nation had come here on 26th January, the artists of that country had also come here with them.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of their countries presented Ramayana before us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are not only in India but in the entire world and in the ASEAN nations, it is still as effective and inspiring.
I once again congratulate you all for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, I have also received a large number of letters, emails, phone calls and reactions on this occasion.
I read what Komal Thakkar has written about starting the Sanskrit online class on MyGov.
Shri Yut Dhanshyam Kumar ji from Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar read the recipe written on the Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed on the depleting water level of the earth is surely very important.
Shri Yut Shakal Scientifying the words of Karnataka, he wrote that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when Ayushman Bharat is a land.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha Ji says that I will speak about the health of the youth at this time.
According to him, if we compare other Asian countries then Indian youth are physically weak.
Yogesh Ji, I thought that I will discuss the topic of health in detail in detail.
The Government of India had shared all the photos and videos on the same day on Social Media and Narendra Modi App.
Now you pick that photo and retweet it and get to your friends.
Anga, Jaisalmer and many other children from Chennai have written to me the idea that they have received in their hearts on the gratitude cards made behind the Ekzam Warrior book.
Anga, Jayash and all others, I want to tell you all that your letters leave my entire day's tiredness.
I got the opportunity to hear such letters, phone calls, reactions and all that I can get to read.
Today, even though I have decided to tell the same thing, I will have to tell it continuously for months.
At present, more and more letters have been sent by children, they have written about the examination.
Your plains have been told me in the holidays.
Animals and birds are not getting water in summers.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to the country about what is happening in the field of farmers fairs and farming.
Some people have suggested solutions to water conservation.
Since we have started this mann Ki Baat through radio, I feel a way in which most of the letters come on the topics related to summer.
Prior to the examination, there are letters about the care of the student's examination.
That is, the things of mind change according to the weather and perhaps it is true that these things in our minds also change the season of life and what will not change
When I get to know in your letter how Ahmed Ali, the rickshaw driver of Karimganj, Assam, has built nine schools for the poor children on the strength of his will, then I would have seen the immense will power of our country.
When I heard of Dr. Akit Mohan Chaudhari from Kanpur, he goes on a pavement and gives food to the poor and also provides free medicines, then I get the opportunity to feel the bondage of the country.
Many passengers travelling through their cabs helped a lot.
An engineer girl gave her first full penny.
He also succeeded in the efforts of Akher Sadul Laskar after collecting 12 years of money.
Today, due to his determination and his hard work, he has built a sickle house with nearly 30 bays of arrangement in Punri village near Kolkata.
Today, the perspective of looking at the entire world towards India has changed.
Today, when the name of India is celebrated with great pride, then the sons and daughters of Bharat Mata have lost their lives.
A positive atmosphere of self-confidence has been created with hope.
This self-confidence, this positiveness and our resolve of a New India will be fulfilled.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months, it is very important for our farmers brothers and sisters.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Scientific, Lohiaji or Chaudhari Charansinghji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, all of them have been considered an integral part of the economy and the common life of the country.
Besides, Lal Bahadur Shastri also emphasized on the protection of trees, plants and plants and the best agricultural structure.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhari Charan Singh had urged the farmers to use new technology and use it innovatively.
This state, which has a very low area, has done great jobs.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have achieved record production in 2015-16 compared to the previous five years.
He has proved that when the goals are determined, the determinations are determined and the will to fulfill them, they can be fulfilled through their experiences.
Brothers and sisters, An important decision has been taken to ensure that the farmers get the right price in the economy of the country.
It has been decided that at least one and a half times the cost of production will be given to the PICs.
As far as we are concerned, the cost of production which will be mentioned in the interests of the farmers, the cost of the farmers, the cost of the animals, the cost of the plants, the equipment or animals, the cost of the seeds, the cost of all the types of fertilizers used, the land revenue given to the state government, the wages given to the state government, if the farmers are on rent, not only their fares, but their farmers also absorb their own lives or if someone in their families works, the cost of their labor will also be added to the cost.
Besides, the work to improve the farm sector across the country is also being done in a wide range to provide proper marketing to the farmers.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the local markets of the village, the Ghauk Bazar and the global markets are together.
In order to ensure that farmers do not have to go far away to sell their goods, they are being provided with state-of-the-art infrastructure to 22 thousand rural markets in the country and will be linked to the Agricultural Response Market Committee and the e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect agriculture with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year Mahatma Gandhis 150th birth anniversary will be inaugurated.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve, and how can we come together and take the best tribute to Gandhiji
What should be the logo of Gandhi 150
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and take inspiration from Bapu and take our country to a new height.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a traditional perspective in the field of health.
It was believed that the Health Ministry had the responsibility to do all the work related to the country.
But now all the ministries and departments, whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Department of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, all the departments are working together for a healthy India.
The preventive care of health is the cheapest and easiest solution.
Therefore, as much as we are aware of health care, the more benefits will be available to the individuals, family and society.
Besides, work is being done at a wider level towards setting up of Healthcare Centres across the country.
Today, Yoga has created a new identity in the field of preventive healthcare.
The body remains healthy and strong by yoga.
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement because of the commitment to Yoga for all of us.
This year's International Day of Yoga (International Yoga) is another 100 days on 21st June.
In the last three years, people from all over the country and the world participated in every International Day of Yoga.
This year too, we must make ourselves Yoga and inspire our entire family, friends and all others to do yoga.
We have to work towards transforming Yoga to children, youth and senior citizens as well as women and men of every age group.
However, the country's telecommunications and electronic media continues to organize various programmes for yoga throughout the year.
But can some programmes to create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher but I am definitely a Yoga teacher.
But some people have made me a Yoga adviser using their imagination and some of my three-dimensional videos have been made.
I would like to convey this video to all of you that we can practice the same asana and pranayama together.
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines are available at a very cost effective rate.
The work to start more new centres is also underway.
I urge the laboratories of Mann Ki Baat to ensure that they reach these public health centres, that is, their cost of medicines will be reduced to a very large extent.
The cost of the stent required for heart patients has been reduced to 85 percent.
The cost of instruments required for knee transplantation has been reduced by 50 to 70 percent.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families, that is, for the treatment of about 50 crore citizens, Rs. 5 lakhs will be provided by the Government of India and insurance companies in a year.
The total number of seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
In order to provide better treatment and better healthcare to the people across the country, new AIIMS hospitals are being opened in different states.
A new medical college will be set up for each three districts.
We aim to make the entire country free from tuberculosis by 2025.
This is a very big task.
There is a need to create awareness for every person and help you.
To get rid of tuberculosis we all have to come together and make efforts .
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is on 14th April.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country.
He believed that the industries could provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, the Make in India campaign is being successfully launched in the country.
In such a situation, Dr. Ambedkars dream of becoming an industrial empowerment is inspiring us.
Today, India has transformed the world's economy into a thirty-five star, the highest FDI in the world is going on in India today.
The entire world is looking at India as an investment, research and development centre.
In addition to this, the Smart Cities Mission and Civil Campaign have been launched today to provide better roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Babasaheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
Nobody was convinced that they should live in poverty.
He also believed that the poor will not be able to overcome their poverty by providing some sustainable facilities to the poor.
Today, young researchers and young entrepreneurs are making initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India.
He had seen the Jal Shakti as the nations power.
It was Baba Saheb's vision to establish several river pipeline authorities and different commissions related to water.
Today, historic efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are developing on the different coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in the old ports.
In the forty decades, the main issues of the discussion were the second war, the war, the sympathetic and the fighting.
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of Team India in a way.
He discussed the importance of the federal system and emphasized the need to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federalism in every department of governance, and even further, competitive cooperative federalism.
And the most important thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of backward classes like me.
He showed us that there is no need to be born in Shreekanth or the prestigious family to go ahead in life, but those born in poor families in India can also see big dreams, efforts can be made to fulfill them and can succeed in it.
Many people have helped Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, the poor and the backward classes.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar, the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan will be organized from 14th April to 5th May.
There will be various programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to participate in this programme in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, many festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi are coming in the coming days.
It is a day to learn from Lord Mahavir Jayanti i. e.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who instructs non-violence, are inspiring for all of us.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
He recalled the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus, who gave the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to mankind.
In April, Baisakhi festival is celebrated in Punjab and West India.
Many thanks.
First of all, the color of the sea looks blue, but in everyday life we feel that the water is colorless, it does not have any color.
Whether it is a river or a sea or a water that looks like a color, should we ever think of it
This question came in the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
With this question, a great scientist of modern India emerged.
He was awarded the Nobel laureate for his best work on lighting.
Their research is popular with the name of Raman Iffect.
On 28th February, Raman is believed to have discovered light scattering, so we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day every year, which he received the Nobel Prize for research.
These countries have given many great scientists in science.
On the one hand, there was a tradition of great mathematician Bodhyan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatt, while on the other hand, Sushrut and Charak are the places of dignity in health care.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Gobind Khurana are proud of India.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose is also known as the famous Boson Constituent.
I got the opportunity to attend a programme of artificial intelligence institution in Mumbai recently.
It was very ironic to know about the miracles in science.
Through artificial intelligence, it helps in creating robots and sweet work machines.
Nowadays instruments are smashing their intelligence through self-scheduled study .
This technology can be used to simplify the lives of poor, deprived and needy.
In this programme of artificial intelligence, I would like to appeal to the scientific community how to use artificial intelligence to simplify the lives of the disabled brothers and sisters.
Can we guess about natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, along with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to inaugurate the I Creat in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There a young man had developed a digital device that cannot be spoken, such a fool has written that his voice is transformed and we can also interact with a person as we speak to a person.
I believe that at many places we can use artificial intelligence.
The machine works according to its will.
But what we want to do is depend on ourselves.
The use of science for human welfare and the use of science to achieve the highest height of human life is important here.
Thomas Alva Edison, who laid the foundation of Vijjay's Divya, had been unable to do so in many of his experiments.
Asked about this, he said that I have discovered ten thousand methods of how to create a light lamp, that is, Edison has made his own strength.
Today, I am here in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and asked for a response to their rule.
As a great sage, he raised questions about every aspect of life.
After finding his answer, he showed the path to humanity.
The spirit of frequent questioning is important to know the truth.
This is also a true inspiration behind scientific research .
We should not remain healthy until the answers are answered by what and how.
I extend my best wishes to all those associated with our scientific and scientific sector on National Science Day.
My best wishes to our younger generation for the search of truth and knowledge and to inspire us to serve society with the help of science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages on the issue of dysentery, crisis, security and disaster. People are writing something or the other.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has written about professional protection in his response to the mobile phone call from Pune.
He writes that the quality of safety at the factory and construction sites in our country is not equally good.
On the 4th of March, India's National Security Day is being celebrated by the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will convey the message of defence in this programme, which will enhance the awareness of the safety of the people.
While we talk about public safety, two things are important, preparedness and preparedness.
Safety is of two types one which is necessary during the time of danger and the other is necessary in the daily life .
We were not aware of the safety in everyday life, but it was difficult to get protection during the time of disaster.
If we continue to maintain the required rules then we can save our lives and save our society from great accidents.
We see that many things have been written about the safety of the workplace but it does not seem to be following.
Those who have fire engines, the municipalities should go to a separate school once in a week or a month and make a mock-drill before students.
It will have two advantages, the Anglishman Dal will also have the habit of being alert and the new generation will also get education and there will be no need to spend separately for it, in a way it becomes a part of education and therefore I am always ahead.
If we talk about disasters and disasters then India is geographically diverse.
The country has caused some natural, man-made, disaster and chemical and industrial accidents.
The NDMA i. e. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on the countrys disaster management.
The NDMA is running rapidly in disasters like earthquakes, floods, floods and landslides.
Training and awareness play an important role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people had lost their lives every year in the wake of heat, NDMA conducted a campaign to wake up and organize workshops.
This indicates that if we give priority to security then we can get protection.
The Agnishaman Seva, National Risk Relief Team, the Armed Forces, the deserted soldiers of the Armed Forces, do not defend their lives during the crisis and help the people.
NCCs and scouts also help in this work and also provide training.
BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Nepal were the first and widespread efforts.
These daughters should be an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in this period's budget, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the emphasis has been laid on creating energy from the toilets to the villages through biogas.
The initiative has been initiated and it has been named as Gobar Dhan and Gallehnaizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from fossil and biological residue, but it is not fully used in India.
We are moving towards this direction under Swachh Bharat Mission Rural.
Animal husbandry, farm waste and waste in the kitchen have been aimed at utilising all these for the use of biogas-based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers and brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged not only to look at the garbage but also as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the villages clean.
The increase in income will help farmers and animal husbandry.
This will increase the employment opportunities in collecting garbage, transportation and sale of biogas.
A online platform will be set up for proper implementation of Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers to the consumer and provide affordable prices to the sugarcane and agricultural waste products.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the brothers and sisters living in rural India, to take initiatives.
I invite you to become a partner of this movement for clean energy and greenery and to transform the wealth of our villages into the wealth of the toilets and to transform the money of the peanuts.
Separate artworks have been created using waste.
Workshops were organized to train people on all aspects of waste management.
Everyone made imaginative ideas about cleanliness, discussed and presented poems.
There was a funny atmosphere about cleanliness.
Specially, the school students participated in the exercise.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, Chhattisgarh and the government and administration for the innovative way to celebrate this festival on waste management and cleanliness.
The International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
Several programmes are organised in the country and around the world.
Women working in different fields are honored this day.
Today, the country is moving towards womens development under the leadership of women.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's thoughts, he said that ideal women's imagination is complete freedom.
Swami ji's idea of women's strength in Indian culture is one hundred and twenty-five years ago.
Today, it is our responsibility to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are part of the tradition where men are identified by women, the son of Yashoda, the daughter of skilled son, the daughter of Gandhi.
Women are strong, they are equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of a New India.
Just a few days ago, a person had suggested me a good thing, he said that on 8th March several programmes will be held on Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis 50 thousand Raj Mistry.
We can imagine that this is such a big event.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into a mass movement in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, I had reached the Elephanta Island in three villages after 70 years of independence and then there was a joy in the people.
We know that this island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
70 years ago, in three villages of Elephantha, the people of Rajbandar, Morbandar and Seat monkey had spread darkness in their lives.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that Elephanta villages and caves are now shining.
This is not just a electricity but a new start.
What can be the pleasure of enjoying the lives of the people of the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated the festival of Maha Shivratri.
The special feature of the month of March is the brightness of the salute crops and the brightness of the Amra Manjeeri.
We are dear to celebrate Holi this month.
On 2nd March, Holi will be celebrated with enthusiasm across the country.
Holi has the importance of color as well as the Holika Day is also important. This is the day to burn the bad trends.
May this festival be happy in the lives of our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
In 2018, we interact with you for the first time today through Mann Ki Baat.
Two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
The event was attended by the honourable guests from 10 countries, which was the first time in history.
My dear countrymen, I am going to mention the letter of Prakash Tripathy today.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that women are progressing in every field in India today, moving forward and enhancing the values of the country.
The glory of women in our country from ancient times, the place of their society and their contributions is a big and innovative thing in terms of the whole world.
There is a great tradition of great sacrifices in India.
Several Indian scholars have played an important role in creating bridges in the Vedas.
Many names like Lopa Mudra, Gargi and Maitrey can be taken.
This women's strength keeps the entire country, the entire society, our family in the pole of unity.
Whether it is a great scholar like Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi in the Vedic times, whether it is a saint of great genius and devotion like Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai, or the government system like Ahilyabai Holkar or a bright Rangai like Rani Lakshmibai, the women's power is always inspiring us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He has written that our Dharadi Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is inspiring the journey from the Shukhoi-30 fighter aircraft.
The three brave women fights like Bhav Kanth, Mohna Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become geographical and are now training in Sukhoi-30.
Just a few days back, the Hon'ble President started a new thing.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, met a group of women who have done something fast for the first time in their fields.
Our women's strength has done an extraordinary job to break the chain of the traditionality of society and established a new record.
He showed that hard work, tireless efforts and if the determination is strong, any crisis has emerged, any obstacles have emerged, they can cross them and create a new way.
Now this path is inspiring not only our contemporary people but also many generations.
The book 'Narendra Modi Website' is available in the form of 'E-book'.
Today, in positive transformations in the country and society, women's strength has played a very important role in this country.
Today, when we talk about women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station here.
Now we have come to know of what is the connection between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Matunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
There are women employees in all the departments in this station.
After observing the guidance of the Republic Day, many people wrote on the Witter and other social media that all women were involved in the BSF Bike Continent.
These women were experiencing extreme adventurous experiments and they also surprised the visitors from abroad.
Both words of empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today, our women are under leadership.
And they are becoming self-reliant.
But these tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new picture in front of the country.
The campus of Dantewada district in Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism.
The Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere here on violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols.
In such dangerous areas, tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running e-rickshaws.
Any society is introducing life, whether it has developed its own transformation system or not.
Continuous efforts are being made in our country against social misconception, bad practices and practices.
Just a few days back, a good effort was made in Bihar.
In order to eradicate social mischief, a human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometres was built in the state, which was the longest human chain in the world.
In this campaign, people created awareness among the society against bad practices such as child marriage, hounding etc.
The entire state has resolved to fight against mischief like Hooda and Balawiha.
Young people, mothers and sisters all joined the campaign.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human chain was linked to the border of the state.
Our society should be free from these evil practices, so that all the people of the society are required to benefit from development.
Let us together take a pledge to eradicate these evils from the society and create a New India, a powerful and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human race.
But after getting information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has started buying medicines from there and now his father's cost has decreased by 75 percent.
This provides huge financial support to the senior citizens, especially those who donate medicines everyday.
The Generic medicines that are being purchased are like standards set by the World Health Organization.
Therefore, good quality medicines can be made available at affordable rates.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This will not only provide affordable medicines but also create a new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and the Amrut Stores of the hospitals.
The only purpose behind all these schemes is to provide quality and quality healthcare to the poorest of the poor and to create a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shriyut Mangesh has sent a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App from Maharashtra.
I would like to express my attention to the differentiation of this photograph.
In this photograph, a maternal grandson had joined the Clean Morana River with his amazement.
I got to know that the people of Akola have started the programme to clean the Morana River in Swachh Bharat Mission.
One more tragic thing is that wild grass and waterfalls were poured in the river utensils.
A large number of wastes and wastes were also thrown on the river and its woods.
A workshop was organised by the villagers and on January 13, before the Makar Sankranti, the Swachh Morana Mohim was constructed, accordingly, in the first phase, both the streams of Morana river were cleaned in four kilometer area.
As long as the Morana river is completely cleaned, I have come to know that Akolkar will continue this scheme on Saturday morning.
One of these shows that if a man decides to do something then it is impossible, it is not at all.
Through mass movement, we can make changes by doing a big job.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of discussion about the Padma Awards that we must have heard.
There is a tradition of giving Padma Awards every year but for the last three years, the entire process of this award has been changed.
Any citizen can now suggest any name for this award.
This entire process has become transparent due to online.
Now the importance of the work done by the person is being taken into account and introduced.
You will be happy to know about the work done by Arvind Gupta Ji.
Aurobindo Ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has spent his life in creating a sportsperson for small children.
They are constantly trying to find out the sciences of the children using scientific experiments from the use of waste and driven things.
For this, he went to three thousand schools across the country and showcased the pictures made in 18 different languages and inspired children.
The same thing is Sitava Jodatti of Karnataka.
They are not being called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, Sita Vehicle has played a major role in transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
In the seventh year of age, you used to devote yourself as a goddess but Sitas spent their entire life for the welfare of the goddesses.
Not only that, he has done great work for the welfare of the Dalit women.
We must have heard about Bhajjoo Shyam in Madhya Pradesh and Bhajjoo Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He was doing a simple job to get rid of it, but he liked to have traditional tribal paintings and paintings.
He has been honored not only in India but in the entire world due to this poem.
His pictures have been demonstrated in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He has been awarded the Padma Shri award by recognizing the talent of Bhajjo Shyam Ji, who has named India overseas.
He has built more than five hundred plants on the basis of his memories.
He has been honored with the Padma Shri Award for his social career by exploring these renowned individuals.
Today I am keen to mention another name here and the 75-year-old Subhashini Mistry of West Bengal has also been selected for the Padma Award.
Subhashani Mistry, the woman rubbed the utensils in the houses of others and sold vegetables to build the hospital.
He was inspired to build a hospital for the poor due to this crisis in life.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated freely in the hospitals constructed by their hard work.
I would like to tell the people of the country that those who work around us, those who live for the society, those who dedicate their lives to the society, those who work for their lives, those who work for their lives, those who work for their lives, those who work for their lives, those who have been working for their lives and those who have been working for their lives, should sometimes bring them before the society.
Such people do not work for respect.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas every year on 9th January.
Puja Mahatma Gandhi had returned from South Africa on 9th January.
On this day, we are celebrating the festival of Indians living in India and around the world.
You will be happy to know that this programme had been attended by Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Canada, Briton, Suriname, South Africa and USA and many other countries.
I would like to thank the European Union for giving this information to the people of the world through a remarkable work, for creating the identity of the people of the original Indian origin and through their vision.
Those who showed a new path to all of us are on the 30th of January, the day of the revered Bapu.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, whether India or world, person or family or society.
Namaskar
This is the last event of Mann Ki Baat and see Yoga today is also the last day of the year 2017.
Throughout the year, we talked together about several things and shared a lot of things.
Innumerable letters, reactions and exchanges that come from us for Mann Ki Baat would always give me new energy.
Now this year will change within a few hours, but our dialogue and dialogue will continue.
In the coming years, we will also interact with new topics and share new experiences.
Many congratulations to all of us for 2018.
Just a few days back, on 25th December, the Christmas Celebrations were celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the world.
We also see the spirit of service in the bibliography.
The Sun of Man Hage, Not Tube Survey, But Tu Sarveh, And Tu Giveh His Life, Aze Blessingtu All Humankind.
In these tables, we can see what is the importance and greatness of ourselves.
Be it any caste, religion, tradition, character, but the invaluable form of humanity is introduced by Savabhav.
In our country, we used to talk about the expulsion of our country, the expulsion work is not expected, the service is done.
We were also called Seva Paramo Dharma.
Shri Ramkrishna Paramhans and Shri Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans have said that life-service should be saved by Shiva.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's bravery and sacrifice is inspiring for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji instructed great livelihoods and lived on the basis of the same values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji worked to inspire people from all such roles as a Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior.
He fought against atrocities and injustice.
He taught people to bind the bonds of caste and religion.
In all these efforts, he had a lot of experience at a personal level.
However, he never blamed the feeling of disgust in his mind.
Every moment in life, he continued to instruct love, sacrifice and peace.
This shows how great and peculiar their personality was.
I am fortunate to have the opportunity to attend the light festival organized by Guru Gobind Singh ji on the occasion of 350th birth anniversary of Patna Sahib.
One January, 2018.
You will also be surprised to know that the new year used to come and one January every year.
But when I say that particular thing, that thing is really special.
And I urge all of you to register our names as voters.
The whole of India is keen to welcome as a voter in the 21st century.
While becoming a voter in the 21st century, we will also be able to realize that we have a respect.
This is the foundation of a New India.
This is the greatest strength of democracy.
Death is the most effective means of bringing about positive changes in the lives of millions of people.
We just have the right to vote.
So how should we be in India in the 21st century
You will also be able to become the builder of India in the 21st century and it will start from January 1.
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be fulfilled on the strength of the skills of this energetic youth.
Whenever we talk about a New India, it should be free from the poisons of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
It should be free from uncleanness and poverty.
In New India, peace, unity and harmony should be our guided power.
Let the youngsters of New India come forward and think about how a New India should be.
They will also set a path for us and a large group of those who have been associated with it will be like this.
We should continue to move ahead and the country will also move ahead.
Now, when I was interacting with you, there was a thought in my mind that can we organize a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Can the youngsters of the age group of 18 to 25 years be able to create a young man by considering the issue of 'New India' in search of various ways
How can we achieve our resolution before 2022
What can we do to build India in the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi had given the form of a mass movement for the freedom movement.
My young friends, today the need of the hour is that we should also create a mass movement for a magnificent and grand India in the 21st century.
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and succeeding.
I believe that a free strong system should be created by considering how the youngsters of New India can get information about all these schemes.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat the last time I used to tell you about the importance of governance.
Any work is easier for those who have positive and excitement.
People in English say, "Pessimism Leeds to Vehicle, Optimism to Power" I was appealing to the people of the country to showcase the positive moments we have experienced in 2017 and welcome to 2018 in such positive environment.
People have given a very positive response to the Vedas, MyGovs and the Narendra Modi App through social media and have shared their experiences.
Some people have done some special work in their personal life.
My name is Manu Bhatia.
I live here in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Faiz One, Delhi.

My name is satisfactory.
The National Highway has been constructed in 2017 from our village Bhiner.
Therefore, the roads have become very good and the business comes to light.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja.
I visit Mohalla Sadatganj in Chhaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bevani.
There was a very serious problem of water in our region and for the last 40 years we depended on the waterways of Army.
Now we have free waterways.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy that has been received from such small things. Let us move forward with determination to move from the beginning of the New Year to the previous India.
Now we are discussing positive things, so I am also encouraging to say one thing here.
Recently, I am very happy to note that Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk, who has secured the highest rank in the Administrative Services Examination in Kashmir.
Terrorism and arbitrariness emerged from the atmosphere and won the first rank in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
The story of success was written by him.
Today Anjum has become an inspiration for not only Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Whatever the situation is bad, it has proved that through positive work, the destruction of disappointment can be done, it has been proved.
Recently, in the last week, I got the opportunity to meet some of the people of Jammu Kashmir.
I used to know the dreams of those who were enthusiastic and those who were encouraged.
He used to say that in what field he wants to progress in his life, it was all the people who lived with great hope.
I used to feel disappointed while talking to them, but I am not disappointed.
They were enthusiastic, joy, joy, energy, great dreams and resolves.
The time I spent with these Kashmiri daughters, I was also inspired by them.
This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to know about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala, not only from our country but also from the famous religious places around the world.
In this world famous temple, millions of devotees come every year to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
P.
No one is big in this campaign, no one is small.
Every traveller takes part in the worship of God and works for cleanliness.
No matter how big a celebrity it is, no matter how rich it is, no one is working in a big position, everybody participates in this 'Punayam Renaissance' program like a common traveler.
There are several such examples for our countrymen.
There is also a strong determination for cleanliness along with hard work.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we all have resolved to make Swachh Bharat, Swachh Bharat and Swachh Bharat free from Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made on a wide scale across the country towards cleanliness.
There is also a change in the rural and urban areas due to the massive participation of the people.
The worlds largest Clean Survey 2018 will be conducted during the period from 4th January to 10th March 2018 to observe how much cleanliness level is in urban areas and how much success is being achieved by the Cleanliness Mission.
This survey will be conducted in more than four thousand cities and about 40 crore people in the country.
In this, efforts are being made to improve the livelihood of the people, to create capacity building and to use some new schemes for cleanliness.
During this survey, different roads will be monitored.
And we will discuss with the people and understand their reactions.
How the Swachhta App is being used and they are being analyzed to improve various services.
It is not just the government to keep cleanliness.
And every citizen and every individual organisation is also responsible for keeping cleanliness.
And I urge every citizen to join a large number of cleanliness surveys.
And you should imagine that your city should not be lagging behind for cleanliness, your roads and your society should not be lagging behind.
I am confident that you must have had the habit of classification of dry wastes and wet wastes and you would have been using blue and green garbage while wasting wastes.
Reduce, reuse and re-social theory for garbage is very effective.
If the population of our city is more than one lakh, then it should be the highest number of people in the regional segment, if there is less than one lakh population in the entire country.
And we should also try that way.
And all of us should have a dream that our city is our endeavour, the progress of our progress and progress.
Let us once again lay the foundation stone of our efforts to fulfil the dream of a clean India by remembering the pious Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small but if we look at it as a society then it becomes our identity.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat program, I want to share one such thing with you.
I understand that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Hajj pilgrimage then she cannot be called 'Maharam' or 'Manush Palakavan'.
Especially, such bonds and rules are not in Islamic countries.
But in India, only Muslim women did not get this right.
And I am very happy to salute here that our government will take care of this thing.
I am confident and my firm belief that the journey of development of India will continue on the strength of our women and their talent.
And that is why our women should also get equal rights and equal opportunities along with men, our continuous efforts should be made and women and men need to move forward on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This year 26th January, 2018 will be remembered in a special manner.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, will visit India as the Chief Guest of all the 10 ASEAN countries on the Republic Day celebrations this year.
This year, there will be 10 Chief Guests not one but on the Republic Day.
The year 2017 was special for both ASEAN's country and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and Indias partnership with ASEAN was completed 25 years in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all our Indians to join these great leaders of 10 countries on 26th January.
Dear Countrymen, the days of festivals are in progress and our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps no such day can be said that no festival is celebrated that day.
In the coming New Year, we all have to take great pleasure, happiness and prosperity.
We all moved ahead with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new joy and new resolves.
The sunset will begin in the month of January and this month the Makar Sankranti will be celebrated and this festival will be associated with nature.
If the Sankranti says in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals have such a special significance.
All these festivals are celebrated during the period of 13th to 17th January.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now we are going to say this again in 2018.
Indian citizens will not be able to find any respect for them.
The age is greater than all of us and are witnesses of different phases and periods of the country.
I had the privilege of interacting with the Didis before travelling abroad.
This kind of lovely interaction was with us to speak to your elder sister in a small sense.
I don't know how to talk about this kind of personal conversation.
Listen, Latadi is also eager to do everything related to the country.
The spirit of satisfaction in his life is associated with the progress of India, with changing India, is associated with a new summit of progress.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar
I am talking to Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I would like to visit the plane.
Lata ji: Good, good.
What to celebrate on the day-long
And the achievement that we have achieved is achieved through meditation and penance.
I really am nothing.
Lata ji: Yes.
Your letters are also available to me and I also get your gifts.
I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I am looking at you, I am sure you are working hard and you have to think of how much.
Modi ji: My mother was very happy because of your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: But I will come soon.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for several weeks.
Your houses will be filled with happiness.
But we must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of the joy of these festivals.
The darkness under the direction is called.
It is not just a word but an order for us, a philosophy, a motivation.
Whenever we come to our houses, sweets, clothes and visits, we should go out for a minute.
At least those things that are more than required in our houses, those things which we do not use now, should be ensured to give it to the needs outside.
In many cities, several such institutions work with start-ups of young colleagues.
They collect essential items like clothes, cereals and food from the houses of the people and find out the requirements and reach them.
Happy laughing on the faces of many poor families will double our joy, will shine more on our faces, our light will be more bright and our lamp will glow more.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmi comes home as a good fortune and prosperity in Diwali and traditionally Laxmi is welcomed.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this year
In our culture, girls have been considered Lakshmi because girls bring good fortunes and prosperity.
Can we organize programmes for the honour of girls in our society, villages and cities this year
Can we organise this programme for the glory of these Lakshmis of India in Diwali this year
There will be many girls around us, many listeners who are doing extraordinary work.
If someone is working to teach the poor children, if someone is working to make people aware about cleanliness and health, if someone is doing the service of the society by becoming a doctor or an engineer, then he will try to justify someone.
Your society should recognise those lakes, respect them and respect them.
This kind of honour should be organized across the country.
One more thing can be done.
Shear more information through social media about the success of these girls and use the Hashtag of Bharat Ki Lakshmi.
We had launched the 'Selfie With Daugter' programme and it was spread all over the world. Similarly, this time we will also celebrate the Lakshmi of India.
Encouraging Indias Laxmi initiative means to strengthen the path of prosperity of the country and the country.
My dear countrymen, I had said back that there is a huge benefit of the Mann Ki Baat programme that I am fortunate to have a direct or indirect interaction with many familiar and unknown persons.
A few days back, Alina Tayang, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, has sent me a chain letter and he has written in it, I read that letter before you.
I live in Roeing in Arunachal Pradesh.
When this year when my exam was finished, some people asked me if you read the book Exam Warriors
I told them that I have not read this book.
But again I purchased this book and read it two-three times.
After that my experience was very good.
If I had read this book before exams then I would have benefitted a lot.
I feel that if we consider the new trend of this book, then it must include some more mantras for the parents and the teachers.
Thank you very much for reading and reading the book Ekzam Warriors twice or three times.
My little friend has also instructed me to do something.
I will definitely follow our instructions.
When we have said that the new trend of this book comes, I will definitely try to write something for the parents and the teachers.
But will I invite you all to help me this work
What are your experiences in everyday life
I once again express my gratitude to my young friend Alina Tayang, who is a student of Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you also talk about the programmes made by the Prime Minister of the country through television.
But you know that I am also a common man like you, a common man and that is why the impact of what is seen on a common life continues to be on me and on my mind, because I am also one of you.
And I also listened to the speech and also saw the confrontation.
Just a short while ago, he was defeated by the Grand Slam winner of 19 times and the last round by the Emperor of the Tenness World Rafael Nadal.
The audience present there greeted him with zeal.
He also congratulated the winner Nadal, how Nadal has inspired memorable youngsters to play tennis.
Even after being defeated in the face of Atitti, he cited his rival Nadal and placed an excellent example of sportspersonship in the world.
While on the other hand the winner Nadal also commended the play of the donor with his heart.
There is a lot that every class and every age person can learn from it.
These are moments that are beyond winning or losing when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The ideas of our ancestors were really satisfactory.
Mani Kanchan Sankalp: When a person has the ability and humility at the same time, the person will not live well.
However, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say is really going to tell you for your good.
The debate will continue and the difference between the parties will continue, but if some things stop at a faster pace, then it will benefit greater.
The thing that grows faster and expands, it becomes difficult to stop.
But in the beginning, if we get awakened and stop it then we can save a lot.
Today, with this feeling, I feel like talking to my dear young friends.
You all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful to the health and it becomes very difficult to get rid of this addiction .
Because of nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of addiction is more in them .
By its consumption in adolescents there is adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I want to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that recently the e-cigarettes have been implemented in India.
E cigarettes are such electronic devices which are different from regular cigarettes .
Because of hot nicotine liquid substances in cigarettes a kind of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is consumed .
You might be aware of the dangers of daily cigarettes, but an inconvenience has been made about e-cigarettes that there is no threat from e-cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals are used in this for not spreading its stink like other cigarettes .
We have seen around us that there are big chensmokers in many houses but still they stop and stop others from smoking.
The point of e-cigarette is different.
If someone smokes around us then he understands us from his side only .
If there is cigarette packet in somebody 's pocket then also he knows only through air .
But these cigarettes are not such that many youngsters and youngsters are unknowingly and sometimes fashioned as fashion statistics in our books, in our grandsons, in our treasuries, and sometimes in their hands and sometimes they are addicted to drugs.
Youth generation is the future of the country.
This type of intoxication should not be harmful to our youngsters, the cigarettes have been banned.
It has been laid down to ensure that the dreams of the family are not destroyed, the lives of the children do not apply to the country or to not spread their hands and feet in the society due to addiction.
I urge you all to leave this intoxication of tobacco and do not commit any indecency towards e-cigarettes.
Let us together create a healthy India.
Hey, you remember Fit India
Fit India doesn't mean that we should go to the gym at two o'clock in the morning and evening.
For fit India one has to stay away from all these intoxications .
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of privilege for us that our country has lived in the birthplace and workplace of many strangers who spend their lives for the welfare of others.
India is the birthplace of many such abnormal people, Karmabhoomi and these are the people who have sacrificed their lives not only for themselves but for the welfare of others.
Such a great person will be honored in VATIN City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will declare Mary Threasia as a saint on 13th October.
The work done by Sister Mr. Threasia for the welfare of humanity in just 50 years of age is a unique example for the entire world.
He was very close to the social service and education sector.
He built several schools, settlements and orphanages.
He established the Congression of the Sisters of the Holy Family which is still fulfilling their livelihoods and aims.
I once again pay my tributes to Sister Marium Threasia and my heartfelt congratulations to the Indian people, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for the whole of India but for the entire world that today, when we celebrate Gandhijis 150th birth anniversary, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single use plastic.
Seeing the leadership that India has taken towards environmental protection, today the eyes of the countries around the world have been enforced towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be joining the Single Youth Plastics Mission on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way, but a young man of our country has started to play a unique role in a unique way.
When I noticed his work, I interacted with him on a phone and tried to know this new experiment.
Perhaps the interaction with them will help some other people of the country.
Shri Yut Ripudman Belvi Ji is making a unique effort.
When I heard the word Plogging for the first time, it was also new for me.
You are launching this programme in an innovative way and in a way that will like the youth.
I express my heartfelt gratitude.
Friends, The Sports Ministry is also organizing the Fight India Plugging Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu this year.
Two kilometers of plogging on October 2nd.
This programme will be organized across the country.
We have heard from the experience of republicans how to do this programme and what to do in the process.
This MoU is also enhancing awareness about peoples health and cleanliness.
I believe that if 130 crore Indians take a step towards getting rid of single use plastic, then India will move 130 crore steps at a time.
Ripudaman ji, once again thank you very much.
My best wishes to you, our team and our vision.
I want to tell you a little about one thing.
I would like to tell you in detail about this in the next news programme, but today I am telling you that you can get the opportunity to prepare.
You must remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was celebrated.
So we should start preparations for that.
There is a lot more time to talk about this.
Some people can start the exercise and some other schemes can also be prepared.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 we will visit 15 places in India.
Programme for stay at least 15 places and one-two nights.
We should see, understand and experience India.
We have so much diversity.
And when people come on vacations on Diwali, they definitely go to visit. Therefore, once again I urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, today the World Tourism Day is being celebrated on 27th September and some of the world's responsible institutions present the tourism records and you will be happy to know that India's competing instructions on tourism have improved.
This has been possible because of the cooperation of all of us, especially because of the importance of tourism, it has been possible.
If we make further efforts then we can surely get the top position in the world's major tourist destinations after completing 75 years of independence.
Enjoyment and enthusiasm should also be there.
Our festivals are celebrated together and celebrated together, so that these cultures also get a new strength of collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
The Times Group 'Vijay Karnataka' has launched a programme in which he urged the children to send letters to the Prime Minister.
He added that if he gives more information about the nature of the children, it will be beneficial in the future for environmental protection.
The girl named Rida Nadaf, Laxmeshwara, has written that she is the daughter of a young man from a slave and she feels proud of this thing.
No Indian will feel proud of the soldiers of the army
And you are the daughters of that young man, it is natural for you to feel proud.
Irfan Begum from Kalburgi has said that his school is 5 km away from his village, so he has to get out of the house and is too late to return home.
He said that he cannot play with his friends for a long time and that he should be a school near his house.
Friends, I got the opportunity to save these letters from the news paper.
Sudha was a good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the event in 1949.
On 26th January, 1950, the Constitution was implemented and therefore, we celebrate 26th January as the Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Parliament.
He worked hard for nearly three years to construct the Constitution.
No field of life, no subject of nature has been wasted in it.
Equality and sensitivity for all is the identity of our state.
It is our duty to follow our Constitution.
Be it citizens or administrators, everybody should amend the Constitution accordingly.
This is the message of state-of-the-art agreement that no one has any harm.
The Musda Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He played a very important role.
He expressed his gratitude for the welfare of every section of society.
On 6th December, we recall and congratulate him on his birth anniversary.
Baba Saheb has a great contribution in making the country prosperous and empowered.
On 15th December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on the death anniversary.
Sardar Patel, who created the identity of the farmer's son and the iron man, has also done an unusual job to build the country in the same field.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Convention.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for fundamental rights, minority and tribals.
But nine years ago, the country cannot forget that the terrorist attack on Mumbai on 2611 today.
Today, the country recalls the brave people, the police and the security guards who had lost their lives.
Their sacrifices will never be forgotten.
He is glad to destroy human power.
Therefore, not only India but all the humanitarian powers of the world should come together and overcome terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi, born on this land, have conveyed the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to destroy our social structure by weakening it.
And therefore, it is the need of the hour to be more aware of the humanitarian powers.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the naval day on 4th December.
Indian Navy protects our maritime shores.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our culture has developed in the coastal areas of the rivers.
Be it Indus River, River Ganga, Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are both economic and strategic.
These are the gates of the entire world.
This country and our land have an incomparable connection with the oceans.
When we look at history, 800-900 years ago, the boats of Maruch King were counted among the most capable boats during the Maruch dynasty.
In the expansion of the Majli empire, his naval lion was looking forward to naming the empire as a financial empire.
Several examples of museums and research visits are still available in Sangam literature.
In most of the ships around the world, women have been allowed in a long time.
However, in the Marg Navy, and that too, 800-900 years ago, women had played a broad role.
These women had also participated in the war.
The Mars rulers had the latest knowledge of shipbuilding.
How can Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his naval power be forgotten while mentioning the boat
The part of Konkan with marine network was included in the state of Shivaji Maharaj .
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Golden Jungle related to Shivaji Maharaj were in the coastal areas or were in the sea.
The boats of Marathas were protecting the forts .
The Arma of Marathas included large and small boats.
Their naval personnel were insistent on attacking any enemy and defending themselves from the attack.
It is impossible to discuss Maratha Arma and not mention Kanhoji Angre.
He gave a new grandeur to the Arma of Marathas and established the foundation stone of the Maratha soldiers at several places.
Even after Independence, Indian Navy has played several roles.
Whether it is the Goa Freedom War or the Indo-Pak war of 1971.
The INS Sumitra of our Navy helped in quick rescue and delivered many fishermen safely from the water to Bangladesh.
During the month of May-June this year, there was a huge supply in Sri Lanka, three boats of our boats reached there and they helped the government and the people there.
The INS Ghaziel of our boat had helped humans in the field of Rohingya in Bangladesh.
In June, the Government of Papua New Guinea gave us the SOS message and our boat helped save the fishermen of their fishermen.
On 21st November, the INS Tricolor of our boat also flew to the rescue of a merchant ship at West Galf.
This year, the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special expedition from 1st to 7th December.
Throughout the week, children, elderly people, all of them celebrated the nation.
There should be an agitation to express respect to the soldiers across the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flag of the leaflet.
If any of your acquaintances are related to the sanctuaries, then they can post their experiences, their brave actions, their films and photographs in the armed forwardsflagday.
In schools and colleges, the people of the army can be invited to know more about the work of the army.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about the soldiers.
This is also the opportunity to collect money for the welfare of all the soldiers of our defence forces.
This fund is used for the welfare and rehabilitation of the injured soldiers for the families of the martyred soldiers in the war by the Military Welfare Board.
Let us also contribute to the strengthening of our armed forces on this occasion.
Let us also express our gratitude for their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December is the World Soil Day.
I also want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the Earth.
Whatever we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food habits are connected to the soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no nutritious soil in the world
How's the survival
This was discussed in our culture a long time ago and that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, the spirit of agriculture, soil, devotion and respect would be very natural in the minds of the people, and the use of several scientific methods also led to the nutrition of soil.
In the lives of the farmers of this country, two things are very important, their devotion towards our soil and their proper career from scientific perspective.
We all are proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are also aware of modern science and use it in agriculture.
I have heard about the Tohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, Bhoranj Block and the farmers there.
Earlier, the farmers used to use chemical fertilizer in an unbalanced manner, so that the quality of soil was lowered.
The production decreased due to which the income of the farmers decreased and the production of soil also decreased.
Some awakening farmers of the village recognized the situation and then the farmers of the village examined their soil, as much as they were advised to use nutrients and organic fertilizers.
On hearing the results, you all will be surprised to see the positive results of the implementation of the guidance provided to the farmers through soil health cards.
In 2016-17, wheat production has increased by three to four times and income has also increased by four to six thousand rupees.
If you are worried about pick-up then you should take care of the soil, if we take care of the soil and the soil of the soil, then we will also take care of it.
More than 10 crore farmers from all over the country have prepared soil health cards to provide better information about their soil and pick up.
We believe in Mother Earth, but have we considered how dangerous it is for the mother of this mother who is like urea
It has been proved by several scientific experiments that the land is damaged by more than necessary uria.
The farmers are the sons of this soil mother and how will she give her mother sick
It is time to revive this relationship between mothers and daughters.
By 2022, that is, till 75 years of our country's independence, can our farmers determine to use the urea for our farmers
Once the sons and sons of Mother Earth concluded that the health of the soil and the soil would improve at a fast pace and the production would also increase.
There will be a true change in the lives of the farmers.
We are now beginning to realize that global temperature rises, environmental changes.
There was a time when the winter started before Diwali.
Now it has come to pass in December and it is extremely cold.
It is our experience that it is not necessary to get out of bed when the winter begins.
But in such a season, the people who are aware work effectively and their examples inspire us all.
But the determination and determination were greater than all these.
The eight-year-old boy couldn't speak, but he took the help of a shirt.
At 5 a.m. in the morning, the son used to go to the household of the village and talk about not open defecation.
With the efforts of these children who have been teaching cleanliness at least 30-40 houses every day, these villages have become open defecation free.
Every moment we get to learn something new.
Today, they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is sports, competition, social initiatives, our disabled people are not behind in any case.
You all remember that in the Rio Olympics competition, our Disabled Sportspersons had earned 4 medals while playing good games and also the World Winner of the Blind T-Twenty Cricket.
Several kinds of competitions are being held across the country.
A few days back, the 17th National Para Transfer Festival was organised in Udaipur.
They don't have muscles in 80 percent of their body, but look at their patience, determination and patience.
He also won the 70th National Para Shipping Competition, with the same skill, the Indian Sports Authority selected him for the 2020 Paralympics.
32 Para hydrocarbons and all of them will be trained at the Excellence Centre in Gujarat.
I congratulate Youth Jigar Thakkar and congratulate him.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, Prophet Hazrat Mohammed Sahib was born.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Eid will inspire all of us to enhance the peace and harmony in society, give new energy and enable them to make a new resolve.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking from Kanpur to Neeraj Singh.
I request you that once again tell us the best ten things you have spoken through Mann Ki Baat in the year so that we will recall that and we will learn something else.
We have made very good reports.
After listening to my words, I feel like adding more to it and changing it.
The old man who lives in the villages, he always says, forget the sadness, do not forget the happiness.
Whether it is a photo or a small story or a small film, I invite that we have to welcome the 2018 with goodwill, with goodwill and positive thoughts.
Or share positive aspects with the National Modi App, on MyGov or on social media.
Brighten the incidents that inspire others.
We all saw the strength and influence of these collective efforts.
I will definitely try to reach the people of the country in the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, in the next month, once again I will interact with you all for Mann Ki Baat.
There will be a lot of opportunities to speak.
Many thanks
Six days after Deepawali, Chhath Parv is one of the most devoted festivals of our country.
In which traditional rules are being followed from diet to costumes.
The unique festival of Chhathpuja is completely associated with the worship of nature and nature .
The Sun and Water Mahaparvas are centres of Chhath worship, while bamboo and mud-made utensils and candles are useful in this puja.
The world worships growing, but in Chhathpuja, it also gives us an instruction to invite them, whose movement is certain.
This festival also includes the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Everyone enthralls the cleanliness of the entire house, the cleanliness of the river, the ponds, the shores, the pilgrimage ghats.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja - Tourism, Disease Redressal and Good Governance.
Usually eat something behind, these are the deficiencies and the insignificant feelings.
But in Chhathpuja after half of the morning, it is a special tradition.
The reason for this is that the ego ends, the ego is a feeling that sustains the progress of the individual.
It is very natural that people are proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am convinced that Mann Ki Baat has been built in a hundred percent season with the people of the country.
Take examples of khadi and handloom.
You will be happy to know that Gandhi Jayanti is always inspired for handloom, khadi and what is the result.
On 17th October, this month, a record sale of Rs. 1 crore twenty lakh was registered at Khadi Gramodyog Bhawan Storage, Delhi.
You might have been happy to hear that Khadi and Handloom should be sold in such a large quantity from the same store.
During Deepawali, sales in Gift Kupna of Khadi have increased by about 680.
The sale of khadi and handicrafts handicrafts has also increased by about 90 percent compared to last year.
Today, young people, old people, women and every elderly people like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how much benefit has been made from this business to the poor families and the families working on handloom.
However, from the experience of the past few years, I can say that after the 'Khadi for Nation' and 'Khadi for Fashion', we have now replaced the 'Khadi for Transformation'.
In the lives of the poor people of Khadi, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor, in the lives of the poor.
This is a big role for rural development.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experiences of my security forces in Deepawali and he has to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also thought of the Narendra Modi App whether our sweets can be accessible to the security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweets of our house should reach the people of the country.
Deepawali has been celebrated with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali has also brought a special experience for me.
I respect every soldier of the security forces for the struggle, dedication and dedication of your security forces to the nation who are facing difficult and toxic situations on the border.
Whenever you get the time, whenever you get the opportunity, you should know the experiences of the youngsters, you should listen to their pride.
Many of us do not know that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also playing an important role in world peace.
Everyone knows the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in the world and their positive landmarks.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means the world is my family.
Because of this belief, India has been active in various initiatives of the UN since the beginning.
We all know that the proposal for Indias deficit and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with the word 'Woi the People'.
India has always emphasized on women equality and the UN manifesto on human rights is a living example.
The Proposals made in his National Frame were changed by Hansa Mehta, representative of All Man and Borne Free and Equal, and later accepted.
If you want to see it then this small change, but only a strong idea was seen from it.
The role of India in the UN Peacekeeping Operations has been played by India through UN Amberel.
More than eighty thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping operations.
Nearly seven thousand soldiers were included in the UN Peacekeeping and this is the third highest in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peace Keepings.
These efforts have been made in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, 20 thousand patients were treated in the Indian Army hospital and they would save countless people.
Indian security forces not only protected the people of different countries but also lived in the hearts of those people.
Indian women have also played an important role in creating peace.
India is the only country in Library to send women police units to the Peace Abhiyan Mission.
And this move in India will inspire the nations of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not only related to the peacekeeping campaign but it is also training India in 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony across the globe.
Shanti Abhiyan is not an easy task.
Our security guards have to work in remote areas.
In his memories, the hearts of every countrymen blossom.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, he was a brave man who was honored with Param Vir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji made a special identity in Cyprus.
In 1989, he appointed him as the Fores Commander for Namibiat, Operation and served him to ensure independence in that country.
General Thiya, who was the Chief of the Indian Army, also led the UN Peacekeeping Forum in Cyprus and blew up in peace.
As a messenger of peace, India always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everybody should live in peace and harmony and move ahead with the vision of creating a better and more peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pious land has been decorated with great personalities who have served humanity with salvation.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagini Nivedita, is also one of these strange people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda called him Nivedita.
Penalty means absolutely dedicated.
Later, he proved himself by working in line with the name.
Yesterday, the 150th anniversary of Sister Nivedita was celebrated.
Swami Vivekananda's tenure was so impressed that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
The oppression of the British rule was very distressed by the Christian investigator.
The British not only made our country a slave but also tried to make us mentally slaughtered.
With the deficiency of our culture, indiscriminate creation rays were always going on.
Bhagin Nivedita ji rebuilt the glory of Indian culture.
He worked to keep people united by awakening national consciousness.
He went to various countries around the world and raised voices against the opponents of peace and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is famous for his revolutionary poem Pudumari Pen, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It was believed that his inspiration was Bhagini Niwedita.
Bhagin Nivedita ji also helped great scientist Jagadishchandra Basu.
Through our articles and analysis, we have helped in research and propagation.
This is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
Scientists and Scientists Jagadishchandra Basu are the best examples.
In 1899, there was a huge plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people lost their lives.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
She was a woman who could live a comfortable life, but she was associated with the service of the poor.
People took inspiration from them and helped them in the service service.
He taught people about cleanliness and service through his work.
On his memorial, he said, "Hear Reposesses Syster Nivadita Hu Gave Hur All to India", the Syster Nivadita is taking rest, who gave you all to India.
Undoubtedly, he has done the same.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children of Baldin on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
The children are the heroes of the creation of a New India.
Earlier, the disease had to be in adult age, it was our concern that the diseases had to come at the last stage of life - they are still seen in small kids.
In the youth, such a disease was due to exception.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are now known as lifestyle disorder .
Being a disease in young age, changes in physical activity and food habits.
It is necessary that society and family should take care of this thing.
When we consider it, we will realize that there is no need to speed up anything.
There is only a need to change our habits regularly, to change our nature.
Instead of going to Liften, take the habit of climbing stairs.
After dinner, the entire family should try to walk with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This Yoga, especially our young friends, will help in self-sufficient lifestyle and prevent lifestyle disorders.
30 minutes before the school, Yoga is very simple and comfortable.
And I would like to say that Yoga can be easily done by any member of the age group.
For this, it can be easily learned and can be done anywhere.
For this, there is no need for special equipment and assistance.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has come in the last few days in the field of sports.
In different fields, our sportspersons have enlightened the name of the country.
ASEA Cup Hawky Trophy won by India in Hockey.
Our sportspersons performed the best and India became Asia Cup champion after 10 years.
Earlier, India Asia Cup Champion was held in 2003 and 2007.
The Hockey Chamul and all his stakeholders are extremely grateful to the countrymen.
After Hockey, there is a screw in Badminton too.
Badminton Star Kedambi Srikantan won the Denmark Open Trophy and won the country's glory.
This is the third Super Series Premier Award after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup will be held this month.
Many federations from all over the world came to India and they showed their skills on football grounds.
I also got the opportunity to see one face.
There was a lot of enthusiasm in the sportspersons.
This big event of World Cup, the whole world was watching us.
I am surprised to see such a huge challenge and the energy, enthusiasm and energy of young sportspersons.
World Cup Organisation was successful and all the organizations performed the best.
Though India didn't get chewing, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of everyone.
The Festival of World Sports, including India, was enjoyed and the entire competition became thrilling and entertaining for Football lovers.
The future of football is enlightening.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, in order to justify the feelings of the people that I write on Swachh Bharat, I have to do this programme everyday and just dedicate my heart to cleanliness.
Some young children send photos of their efforts while some of the youngsters are in it.
Somewhere there is a story of a new initiative about cleanliness, but due to the passion of an officer, there is news of changes in the people.
Just a few days back, I received a detailed report, in which there is a legislation between the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
There was a voluntary organization called Ecological Protection Organization conducted a Swachhta Abhiyan at Chandrapur Fort.
In this two hundred days-long campaign, people did not stop, neither tired nor did they work for the cleanliness of the fort.
I am surprised to see photographs and whoever saw this photograph, whose hearts have been disappointed, it has never been felt that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled, then I would like to tell my people that you can see the pictures of the youth of the Economical Protecting Organization, their sufferings, excellence and their determination.
Seeing this, our disappointment will change into trust.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate all the Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji is not the first Guru of the Sikhs but he is Jagadguru.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity, and addressed all the people equally.
He emphasized on women empowerment and womens dignity.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji travelled 28 thousand kilometers and during this journey, he taught the true humanity.
He interacted with the people, shown the path of truth, sacrifice and duties.
He gave the message of social equality and this teaching was not only shown by speaking but also by our work.
He started the anchor and created a sense of service to the people.
By sitting together, the feelings of unity and equality were created in the people.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji gave three messages of meaningful life - Remember, work, work and help whenever necessary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had constructed the Gurbani to tell his principles.
In the coming year, we will celebrate the five and a half thousand light years of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Let us try to walk on the path of his teachings and instruction.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on October 31, two days.
We know that he had laid the foundation stone of unified modern India.
Today, we can learn a lot from the life of this great saint of Mother India.
The characteristics of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel are that they are not only transformative ideas, but they are committed to finding a practical solution from complex problems to achieve them.
He was skilled in realizing the ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel worked in an instrument for India.
It is decided that millions of Indians can be brought to the territory of a nation and a Constitution.
He enabled them to overcome all their complications.
He honoured him wherever he wanted to be honored.
Where sacrifices were needed, they used sacrifices.
He decided a goal and he was guided by the determination with that goal.
Only those people could do the work to keep the country together.
He dreamed of a nation where all the people would be equal.
I believe that the ideas of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel are always inspiring.
He said that no discrimination of casteism can stop us, all are daughters and daughters of India, we should love the country and we should have a future on each other's love and harmony.
Sardar Saheb's ideas are still inspiring for our New India vision.
And his birthday is celebrated as National Integration Day.
I urge all of you to join the Run for Unity - this festival of our goodwill.
Dear countrymen, after Diwali vacations, with new resolutions and new determinations, all of you have come in everyday life.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to fulfill all their dreams.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Three years have been completed by the Akashvani by declaring Mann Ki Baat.
Today this is the 36th part.
Most of them are those who inspire me.
Many things have to be done to improve the government.
There are also some personal complaints.
And I take half an hour from a month but people keep sending their words on the thirty days of Mann Ki Baat.
The result is that the government has also got sensitivity.
This three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is an intense journey of feelings and feelings of the people of the country.
Perhaps in such a short span of time, I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country and I am grateful to the people of the country.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one thing of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba always used to say, "A-Governmental, non-Governmental."
A stable mind has tried to connect with us instead of swelling in the topics that have been wrathful at that time.
Now after three years, I am aware that social researchers, universities, researchers, intellectuals and medium experts will definitely analyze it.
And I am confident that the thoughts made by this comfort will be more useful in the future.
I had once said in Mann Ki Baat that it is necessary to worry about the requirements that we should not be used during our dinner.
After this, I saw a large number of letters from all corners of the country.
Several social organisations and many youngsters have been working in the past.
I am aware that there are many people who have been working to utilize the foodgrains that can be used together.
Once I saw the story of Selfie with Doctor of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I told them all in Mann Ki Baat.
In view of this, not only in India but also in the entire world, a big campaign like Selfie With Doter was launched.
This is not just a matter of social media.
Every daughter became a new self-confidence and a new pride.
Just a few days ago, I was discussing with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people who went out to roam around, you should send pictures wherever you go on the subject of 'Absolute India' and millions of photos have come.
It has come from every corner of India, in a way it is a big challenge for those working in the tourism sector.
I realized how big a small event can create a movement, because of this Mann Ki Baat.
Today I used to think about the three years since the beginning of Mann Ki Baat. At that time many incidents of last three years have touched my heart.
Every moment we are thinking about going through the right path of the country.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country.
I have understood and learnt from the people of the country in the Mann Ki Baat campaign of my three years.
I bow down to the countrymen with my heart.
Once I had discussed Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi is not a cloth but a thought.
I would like to once again urge you to continue the campaign of Khadi which has started.
If we buy Khadi then we should work with this feeling that the poor people will get a bright bright light in their homes.
This work will strengthen the poor people of our country and therefore we should do this work.
How to bring new technology, how to increase production capacity, how to handle solar energy
The idea is that the old 2020, 25-25 and 30-30 years have been closed and how it can be revived.
The Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been linked with it.
Many people have been provided with new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries closed in Pampore, Kashmir, once again started their training centres and there is a lot to contribute towards Kashmir.
With the resumption of this training centre, new generations will be helped in modernizing, clothing and in inclusion of new things.
People have also started giving khadi goods while meeting each other.
Cleanliness will connect the people.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the function and participated in the entire nation.
Whether it is an old man or a man or a woman or a city or a village or a village, everyone has become a part of this cleanliness mission today.
When I say that Sankalp se Siddhi is now looking at how this cleanliness mission is moving towards a resolution.
Everyone accepts, collaborates and contributes to the movement.
I express my gratitude to the Hon'ble President.
But at the same time every section of the country has considered it as its work.
I believe that it is a matter of great pleasure for me that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people participated in the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign, more than 40 thousand programmes and I have seen that some people are constantly working and the results will continue to work.
One thing is that we have to clean up somewhere, the other thing is that we dont have to do cleanliness by staying awake but if we want to create cleanliness then a ideological movement is also needed.
On this occasion, a number of competitions have been held in connection with the Swachhta Abhiyan.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the essay competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children picked up pictures.
Using our imaginations, we depicted pictures on cleanliness.
Many people wrote poems and during these days, the pictures that I have sent by my young friends and young children are posted in social media.
Whenever cleanliness comes, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
These people have taken this movement in a very good manner.
In your own way, he is also leading the Swachhta movement.
We can see how much service the country can serve through electronic media and through printed media in this Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
Just a few days back, somebody took care of the 18-year-old young man of Srinagar, Bilal Dar.
No, nothing like that.
Bilal Dar works as cleanliness for the last five-six years since the age of 12-13.
The largest pond in Asia is near Srinagar, the pond has plastic, polythene, the utilised bags, the garbage, the garbage and the dirt and clean the pond.
BILL DAR is young but it has become an inspiration for everybody who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we should acknowledge that the future history is born from the womb of history and when history comes out, it is very natural to remember the great men.
This month of October is a month to remember many great men.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji.
Who was the center of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left the political life and was engaged in the work of rural and it is very natural to feel proud of the work of his rural brothers and sisters when he is celebrating centenary years.
The President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam Ji, spoke of the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh when he was interacting with the youth.
With great respect, he used to mention Nanaji's work and he himself went to villages to see Nanaji's work.
Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji used to talk about the person at the end of the society like Mahatma Gandhi.
Sardar Saheb had brought the entire country together.
Now we should also move forward the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We are very easily and naturally saying that the characteristics of unity in diversity are India.
We respect diversity but have we ever tried to realize this diversity
I would like to reiterate to my countrymen of India, especially to my younger generation that we are in a state of awakening.
Summer holidays are the days of Diwali and our country has to go out somewhere.
People go out as tourists and they are very natural.
But sometimes it seems to be a matter of concern that our people don't see our country, they don't know the diversity of the country.
You must go out of the country, I don't oppose it, but sometimes you should also look at the places of our country.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and his mother-in-law, President Abdul Kalam Ji, once again remembered one thing that when they visited India, they were brought to India and at the same time they had a new inspiration to live for this country and to sacrifice their lives for this country.
All these great men had travelled widely in India.
He tried to understand and know India at the beginning of his work.
Financial growth in tourism will happen at a time when we don't just go back as a client, become a student and try to understand their lives.
In more than four and a half hundred districts, I have got the opportunity to stop the night and today, whenever I take this responsibility in India, I am very well aware of the confusion that I have done.
It doesn't take time.
I would like to urge you all that in this huge India, unity in diversity is not just a declaration but a share of our traditional power.
We have many types of food habits .
If we keep eating a new food every day, there are so many types that the first thing will not come again.
Now, this is a big strength of our tourism.
I am confident that even if you go out to visit this time, you will take my first campaign forward.
You must send photos on Hashtag Incredible India.
If you meet the people there then send their photographs.
I am convinced that in order to promote tourism in India, there can be seven best tourist destinations in our state, each Indian should be aware of the seven special places in his state.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can we give some information about these places
Can we provide this information on the Narendra Modi App
Can we know about the Hashtag Incredible India
If all the people of one state start giving such good information then I would like to tell the government to remove the information that has come and create publicity literature about the seven things that have come from every state.
This means how to promote tourist places in a way through public opinion .
The Government of India will work on it.
Come on, join me.
You can also become a big and important partner in promoting tourism in the country from October to March.
I am inviting you for that.
My dear countrymen, many things touch my heart as a person.
There are waves in my heart.
Some of the things in my mind are ruined and ruined.
In the end, I am a man like you.
Indian Army has got two brave soldiers in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Funds.
For this reason, both autonomy and funds had been martyred while serving Bharat Mata.
We can imagine how the world will be destroyed in such a young age.
But the wife of martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik, Swati Mahadik, settled herself in the heart while facing this difficult situation and became a member of the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and completed his training and put his life in fulfilling his dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, his President Mukesh Dubey was a hero in Lashkar and was martyred for the motherland.
And his wife Nidhi decided that we had to fill the army and fulfilled the determination.
It is natural for every countrymen to respect our mother-sacrifice and our brave men.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to these two brothers.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri and Diwali is a great opportunity for the youth of the country.
The FIFA World Fertilizer Competition will be held in our country this year.
I am confident that you will have to hear the sound of football all around.
Every age group will be interested in football.
Your youngsters are not seen playing in the fields of schools and colleges in India.
Come, this whole world is coming to play on the soil of India, then we can also make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, Navaratri is being celebrated.
The time of prayer of Mother Durga is .
How the entire atmosphere is frozen with sacred fragrance.
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the whole country celebrated the festival, on the other hand, it is natural for us to worry about violence from any part of India, it is the country of Buddha and Gandhi.
It is Sardar Patels country that brings our lives to the souls of the country.
For decades, our ancestors have accepted the public life of our children, non-violence, with equal respect.
We have heard Ahimsa Paramo Dharma since childhood.
I had told from the ramparts that violence will not be taken in the name of faith, whether it is communal belief or belief in political ideology, whether it is belief in the people or belief in the tradition, no one has the right to take the law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the people of the country that those who take the law in hand, those who dominate the path of violence, whether they are those people or groups, the country will never bear it and no government will bear it.
Everyone has to bow before the law.
Because of the cultural tradition of thousands of years, cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, perhaps there should not be a single day in 365 days that will remain without a song.
Now we must have seen that our festivals are going on according to the nature cycle.
There is a direct relation with nature .
Most of our festivals are associated with the farmers.
First of all, I want to call you 'Michchami Dukkadam'.
The festival of sanctuary was celebrated yesterday in Jain society.
In Jain society, Parushan Parv is celebrated in Bhadramasa.
On the last day of the festival, the festival is the day of sensitivity.
This is indeed a unique tradition.
The day of Sanvatsar is a symbol of strength, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it also goes to the shining day and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other microscopic dukkam .
We have heard this thing and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that it is the privilege of a strong man.
In his play, Shekspeare has written the significance of compassion in the Marchart of Venice to the experts, "Marcy is twice blest, it is blessed with gifts and immunity tactics".
My dear countrymen, at present, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated every corner of the country with great joy.
When the topic of Ganesh Chaturthi comes, it is natural to speak on the public Ganesh festival.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi runs for ten days.
This festival is believed to be a symbol of unity, equality and sympathy.
Ganeshotsav's heartiest congratulations to all the nations.
Recently, Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
ONAM is one of the major festivals of Kerala in diverse colours of India.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
At present this festival is seen to be the reason of tourism attraction .
I would like to tell the countrymen that the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way .
And our other festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think of what we can do in that direction.
In the series of these festivals, Id-ul-uha will be celebrated throughout the country in a few days.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen.
Celebrations are a symbol of faith and trust for us.
We have to make our New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Functions have been linked to cleanliness in family life.
Celebrations means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it is necessary to have a social nature.
Cleanliness should be an incomplete part not only in the house, but in the entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernization is changing.
A big campaign like Eko Friendly Ganpati has been launched.
If you look at the YouTube, you are making the daughters of every household a gentleman and you are being made a gentleman by bringing the soil.
Someone is colouring the vegetables and somebody is teasing the paper.
Different kinds of experiments are being done in every family.
And it seems that when we know new experiments.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was started, it would take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
The toilets have reached nearly 67 lakhs from 39 percent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have been declared free of defecation.
Just a few days back, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of Pura decreased, the dirt spread everywhere.
At the same time, the workers of Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hindi in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat had cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques in a systematic manner.
Everybody sweated up and everyone swept away.
The best example of unity for cleanliness, the inspirational example of everybody, was given by all the workers of Ulema-e-Hindi in Jamia.
And if this becomes our permanent feeling, then where can our country go
My dear countrymen, I urge you all that once again, the 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, the Swachhta Hi Seva, the Swachhta Seva, the Prabhu Seva, the Swachhta Seva, the Swachhta Seva.
Make a clean environment throughout the country.
Whenever we get the opportunity, we should find the opportunity.
But we all come together.
On holidays or Sundays come together and work together .
Go to the neighbourhood but work with a movement.
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, socio-cultural political leaders, the government officials, the collectors and the Sarpanches to create an unclean environment for 15 days before Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov
A department has been set up in which you can write your name and the name of the family which we have helped after the construction of toilets.
My friends from Social Media can run a few constructive campaigns and actually become inspired by the world.
This campaign is being organised by the Ministry of Swachh Swachh Sankalp, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, in which Essay Competition, Small Film Making Competition, Chitrakoot Competition.
We can write a bond in different languages and there is no bondage of age.
We can make a small film. We can make a mobile phone.
You can make a film of 2-3 minutes which will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness mission.
I would like to reiterate that this time, on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti will be celebrated on 2nd October, and for this, the Ministry of Cleanliness will be delivered to the household from 15th September.
Some steps have been taken for cleanliness.
Be a part of it by working yourself.
You can see how Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after the 15-day Swachhta Abhiyan, when Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated on 2nd October, we will be happy to pay homage to the righteous Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I specially want to accept my loan today.
I express my gratitude to my heart because we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time. I would like to express my gratitude for the loan that crores of people of the country are being linked through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
The more you look forward to Mann Ki Baat, the more I wait for my message.
I am anxious because I get to learn something from each of your things.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to you for your contribution.
We are connecting our mobile phones and become a part of this wrong habit.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, spoke from Pune.
I would like to tell my friend that every time I tried to help people, but I was surprised to see a habit of it.
Once I went to the shopping mall with him.
We make payments without expressing anything at large, but we are fighting with our hard workforce.
Do you not think that there is always a connection with the seller, the small shopkeeper, the seller, the seller and the seller of some nearby commodities.
Moreover, we used to pay a reduction of two-five rupees and we used to go to eat in a big hotel that even the bill doesn't look at it.
The question is not of Rs.
He is poor, so he has doubted his honesty that there will not be any change in your life by two-five rupees, but never thought how much of your small habits would hurt him.
Madam, I am grateful to you that we have given me a message by calling the phone touching our hearts.
I am confident that my countrymen will also behave like this with the poor.
My dear young friends, the whole country is celebrating 29th August as National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the great Hockey player and Hockey junior Major Dhyanchand Ji.
His contribution to Hockey is incomparable.
I want to remind you that I want to join the new generation of sports in our country.
Sports should be part of our lives.
If we are youngsters in the world, then we should be seen in the field of youth sports.
Sports means physical sensitivity, intellectual readiness, emotional collaboration.
I understand what more than that
The sports activity is one way to connect the heart .
Today, in the era of computers, I want to tell you that the sports sector is more important than the sports stations.
Play a FIFA game on the computer but show some work on the outskirts.
The joy of playing cricket in the field outside the computer cricket is different .
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and you would never go home.
Today the situation is such that when the children come home and watch the games or cartoon films on the mobile, then the mother has to shut down and think that when you are going out
This was a time when the mother told the child that you would never be able to say that this time has come that when will you go out
It is a matter of great pleasure for our youth that the FIFA World Cup is being organised in October 6 to 28, 2017.
Today, while talking about sports, there has been an incident in the last week that I want to tell the people.
I got the opportunity to meet a young girl, some of whom were born in the Himalayas.
Sometimes 30-30 days have been spent in water, this six daughters in the waves of the sea will be the first incident in the world.
Any Indian who will not be proud of the daughters
I salute the beliefs of these girls and I congratulate them and tell them this experience to all the countrymen.
I am also going to provide a different place for their feelings on the Narendra Modi Power.
Because we must save their experiences because it is a kind of adventurous story, a story of prosperity and I will be happy to tell you that my daughters are blessed and blessed.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we celebrate all the Teachers Day.
The birth anniversary of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan Ji.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
Encouraging creative feelings and knowledge among our students is an important quality of learning.
When we celebrate the Teacher's Day, can we make a plan together
Let us show the way to build a resolution for a period of five years and after five years we can enjoy the enjoyment of the fulfilment of the resolution.
There is an incident in every teacher's life that his efforts would have resulted in a change in the lives of somebody.
If we make a collective effort then we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I live in Mumbai for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is a matter of discussion not only of India but of the rich people of the entire world.
On 28th August, 2014, the scheme was started with a dream in the mind.
Tomorrow, the scheme will be completed for 3 years.
30 crore new families have been connected, bank accounts have been removed.
Today, I am glad that the poor people of the society have been made the country's economy.
Now there is an atmosphere of restraint.
He feels that the money will benefit the children.
During this period, some good work can be done.
Not only this, the poor who sees the Rupay Card in their treasury, feels like Mrs.
He feels an honorable experience.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the bank.
This is their strength in the future and the image of the accounts opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been delegated.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJVY) has created a huge trust in the poor today.
If there is something for the mainstream of the family due to a rupee discount in many families, then his family will get Rs.
Today is not so much time but I will tell the people of the bank to upload it to my Government.
My dear countrymen, we have a minimal dukkam.
Thank you very much
Man's mind feels that he feels very charming in the rainy season.
Animals, birds, trees and nature all are enjoyed by the arrival of rain.
But this rain sometimes takes a record form and then it is felt that there is such a power to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, nurturing us, but sometimes it is a terrible destruction in the natural calamities of floods and earthquakes.
Whatever changes are taking place in the changing season and environment, there is also a huge negative impact.
In the past few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, are facing natural calamities.
There is a complete monitoring on the flood affected areas.
Whether it is the government of India, the people of the army, the people of the air force, the NDRF, the officials of the NDRF, all of whom blew up their lives in such a situation.
Farming, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electricity, connectivity etc.
People are also telling their problems.
Gradually, all of us can prepare a timetable for our work according to the climate.
When I prepare the Mann Ki Baat, the citizens of the country are more prepared than me.
On this occasion, I got a lot of news on the topic of GST, a lot of phone calls have been received and people are still expressing joy at the GST and are also expressing condolences.
A phone call will also tell you: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I speak from Gurgaon to Netu Garg.
I heard and was very impressed with the speech of your Chartered Authority Day.
Similarly, GST has been started in our country on the same date last month.
What can we say whether the government had asked about this decision and whether the results are available after a month or not
I want to listen to your thoughts about this.
It has been almost a month since the implementation of GST and its benefits have also been seen.
I am happy to note that how GST has reduced the prices of the poor, how the goods have been cheaper, when a poor person writes a letter.
Anyone who lives in the forests in the remote hills of Ishanya says that what the GST is not aware of it was initially scared but now it is easier to learn about it as much as the work is easier.
All these facilities are available, but it is also being strengthened to achieve the same financial pace.
The speed at which this change has come into force, the speed at which it has been transformed has changed has created an atmosphere of trust across the country.
In the field of economies, the learned in the field of management, the learned in the field of technology, the use of GST of India will never be considered as an ideal system.
This will be an example of a study for many universities in the world.
Because such a huge change has been made and it is a huge pole of success to implement this tax in such a huge country with the participation of millions of people.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre together.
As a result, every government asked the Prime Minister that GST does not have any excessive burden on the expenditure of poor foodgrains.
You are well aware that what was the price of something before GST and what is the price in the new situation is available on the GST App on mobile.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the ministries, all the departments, all the workers of the Central and the State Government for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of Indias collective powers.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a taxation but a new authentic culture.
There is also a campaign for social reform.
I once again congratulate millions and millions of people for losing such a big job.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
Similarly, in August, there have been several such incidents that are associated with the history of freedom.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people will be aware that the slogan "Shove India" is Dr.
Yusuf Mehr Ali had given it.
We need to know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
What can be a bigger inspiration than that
The Bharat Chhodo movement was an important federation of the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had envisaged the entire country to be free from British rule.
This was the time when Indian people, every corner of the country, villages, cities, cities, well-educated, uneducated or poor, Smt.
Millions of Indians resisted Mahatma Gandhi's invocation and blew up their lives with the mantra of 'Karo'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and had changed their books.
The great men like Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan had played a key role.
Gandhiji's two different forms are seen in the events of 'Sahakar Abholan' and 'Bharat Chhodo Abholan' - 1920 and 1942.
The shape of the movement was different and in the last 42 years, the rapidity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Karo Death.
Behind all these successes, peoples support, peoples power, peoples resolve and peoples participation were there.
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I feel that if we look at the leaves of history, the first freedom struggle of India was established in 1857.
This freedom struggle, which began from 1857, was going on every moment in some or the other part of the country till 1942.
This long-term period awakened the spirit of freedom in the minds of the people of the country.
Everyone is committed to doing something or the other in that direction.
Years have changed but the determination has not changed.
The country was making every effort to thwart the royalty of the British.
It was five years decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today, 2017 is going on.
The incident took about 70 years.
During the period, governments have come.
The system has been created, changed, despised and increased.
Everyone tried to get rid of the problem in their own way.
Efforts have been made to improve the lives of the country, to overcome poverty and to achieve development.
Your hard work was done in your own way.
He also got success.
Heightened more than that.
As it was from 1942 to 1947, it was five years of the Constitution.
Similarly, I see that the five-year period from 2017 to 2022 is now ahead of us.
We will celebrate this 15th August, 2017 as a Sankalp Parv and when we complete 75 years of Independence in 2022, we will fulfill that resolve.
Today, not just the announcement of 'Karenge this Marenge' but also to connect with this resolve of a New India, we have to achieve success in combining this task.
This resolution has to be awakened and fought.
Let us run a grand campaign from Sankalp to its achievements on 9th August in August.
Every Indian, social organisation, local organisation, schools, colleges, different organisations - everybody should make some or the other new ideas for a New India.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
Today we are going to be part of this Sankalp Parv or not.
Therefore, I invite my young friends, especially in the online world, to come forward to contribute in the creation of a New India.
Use of technology, we need to take all such ideas like video, post, blog, glass and new ideas.
Give this mission a mass movement.
uit India uiz will also be launched for young friends on NARENDRAMODIAP.
This question of uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the heroes of freedom fighters.
I believe that you will spread and propagate it on a wide scale.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country on August 15, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am just a day.
Definitely send your views on MyGov or NARENDRAMODIAP.
And I will try to ask for this idea as long as I get it on August 15.
On the last three occasions, I had heard a complaint about my 15th August speech that my speech was a bit longer.
I will complete it in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a social economy in the economy of India.
And that economy will never be able to write less.
Our festivals and festivals are not just a matter of joy and enthusiasm.
Our festivals are also the medium of social reform.
But at the same time, each of our festival has a direct connection with the economic life of the poor.
Just a few days back, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganeshotsav, then the fourth moon, then Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja and Diwali will come together and this is the time when the poor get the opportunity to connect their economies.
And this festival also enjoys an easier joy.
And if we talk about the economy, hundreds of families start making Rakshas through small household industries several months before Raksha Bandhan.
From Khadi to silky pottery, no one knows how many kinds of buffaloes are produced and nowadays people have become more liked by homemade and household buffaloes.
The business of thousands and hundreds of people is connected to the festival of breeding, breeding, sweets.
It is directly related to the poor families that make small mud lamps.
But today, I want to consider the issue of environment while talking about the economy of the poor people associated with the festivals and festivals.
And he has urged me to talk about the environment, that is, eco-friendly ganeshamurthy in the context of Ganeshotsav, so that people can be able to select the statue of soil right now.
First of all, I am grateful to these people.
He urged me to ask for this topic beforehand.
This year the public Ganesh festival has a special significance.
And I am confident that when I tell you this thing a long time ago, you all will be connected with this project.
And the poor artisans, poor artists will get jobs and the poor will get their stomach filled with it.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor or the economy of the poor, let us enjoy our festivals as a celebration of the economic benefits of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals.
Our countrymen are proud of these girls.
Just a few days back, our girls demonstrated their sports in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
He was very happy to speak to them, but I realized that there was a lot of confusion about not winning the World Cup.
This stain was seen on their faces.
I told them a different analysis.
I said, 'Look, today there is a time of renowned meditation that it is more than that.
It has been increased so that when success is not achieved, the same aspirations change in anger.
We have seen many such sportspersons in which the country's anger is expressed on those sportspersons.
Some people leave their limits and say something that is very painful.
But for the first time, even though our girls were not able to win the world-class, the 1. 25 billion citizens of the country took the burden of the defeat.
In fact, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
I once again congratulate the young generation of the country, especially our daughters.
Each countrymen should take a pledge and every countrymen should take a pledge to accomplish that resolution in the next five years.
Come, let us come together and move ahead, let us do something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The weather is changing.
This year the summer was also very strong.
However, the monsoon rains have come in time and the following trends are going on smoothly.
In many parts of the country, there is a humid atmosphere due to heavy rains.
After the rains, heavy rains have been relieved of sunlight in the last few days.
And we all have seen that whatever kind of hurdles in life, whatever kind of tensions, personal life or public life, the arrival of monsoon changes our mindset.
The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm in many parts of the country today.
Even in some parts of the world, the festival of Lord Jagannatha's Rath Yatra is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
Those who are Dr .
Babasaheb Ambedkar has been taught, he must have seen that he had to praise the temple and his traditions of Lord Jagannath ji, because it included social justice and social harmony.
The sacred month of Ramadan was celebrated with sacred devotion.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramadan is a month to pay homage.
There is a month of enjoyment and as much enjoyment as you want.
Come together, let us take the country forward by taking inspiration from these sacred festivals.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, a very inspiring event of the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
About three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village, in a way, the population of brothers and sisters of our Muslim families is more.
During this Ramzan, the villagers have decided to build toilets together.
The government also provides assistance for this individual toilet and under this assistance, about 17 lakh rupees have been given to them.
You can spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this sacred day into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
Their one thing is also very inspiring.
And the most important thing is that he made Mubarakpur free from dignity.
We know that Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already declared three states in our country.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared unemployed this week.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration of these five states, the government and the people for completing this work.
Whenever the body and the mind gets swollen.
The subject of cleanliness is similar.
These bad habits have become part of our nature.
We have become part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everyone has to pay attention.
The best inspirational events will be reminiscent.
And I am happy that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is becoming the movement of the society and the common man.
And when the people sitting in the government also take this task forward from the public participation then its strength increases several times.
Recently, an excellent event came in my mind, which I would like to tell you.
The event is in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration had taken a lot of work from the public sector.
100 hours of tireless operation.
And what is the goal
Build toilets in 10 thousand houses in 71 rural panchayats within 100 hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and administration together completed the work of constructing 10 thousand toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages became inflation-free.
I congratulate the people living in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village in Vijayanagaram district, who have shown a very inspiring example with tireless hard work.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced the gathering at Rashtrapati Bhavan, here today (April 12, 2018).
And democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
The consciousness of the interim is the price of liberation.
Regular awareness about democracy is essential and therefore, the people used to recall the things that hurt democracy and move forward towards good things of democracy.
June 1975-25 was a period that cannot forget any democratic lover.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the transformation of the country was done in the triangles.
The opponent sound was pressed.
Shri Jayaprakash Narayan, along with the dignitaries of the country, were present in Turunga.
Even the judiciary could not be saved from that terrible shadow of crisis.
The newspapers were completely unemployed.
Today's journalists, students from the world, people working in the Republic of India are constantly trying to enhance the awareness of democracy and keep doing so.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in Turunga.
Atal ji had written a poem when he commemorated a year and he describes the mindset of that period in his poem.
My dear countrymen, today the values of every Indian have been raised in the world.
21st June, 2017, the entire world was celebrating Yoga.
From the sea to the mountains people welcomed the sun rays in the morning and evening through yoga.
There will be no Indian who will not be proud of it.
But today when Yoga has been built in the throne of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga.
People from China's The Great Wall of China performed yoga while people performed yoga at a height of 2400 meters above the world heritage site Machu-Picchu in Peru.
People practiced yoga in the shadow of the Aiffel Tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India gave a different order to India's friendship by imparting Yoga on the Afghan friend Dam i. e.
Yoga classes were organized with Yoga Masters at the headquarters of the United Nations.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people from Ahmedabad got a new global record by doing yoga at the same time.
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time, I am fortunate to do Yoga in the rains.
Where our youngsters had 20, 25 and 40 degrees of temperature, they also performed yoga in Siachen.
Whether it is our armed forces, border security forces, ITBPs, CRPFs, everybody has made Yoga associations with their work.
On this Yoga Day, I used to say that because this is the third International Day of Yoga, I used to say that the three generations of the family should send their photographs to me.
Some television channels also raised this issue.
Some of the selected photographs have been collected on the NARENDRAMODIAP.
Just a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit my very favorite event.
In Kerala, a few years ago.
N.
An excellent programme is organised by Panikar Petitioner, and a reading day and a reading month is celebrated to make people aware of the habit of reading books.
Now remind me of what I had done with my thoughts.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a tradition in the government that if we don't want to give a flower, we would like to welcome it by giving a book or handloom.
Even so, Khadi handicrafts will be made so that Khadi can be encouraged.
As long as I was in Gujarat, we had become the habit of all of us, but after coming here, I had lost my habit.
But she went to Kerala and once again she became aware of her habit.
And now I have started giving information to the lower people in the government.
We can also gradually create a habit.
The lives of the flowers were very low.
Once he took it in his hand and then put it in his hand.
But if the book is given then it will be a part of the house and become part of the family.
When I am telling this thing, how many such historical values were there.
When I went to England last year, British ueen Elizabeth in London invited me to dinner.
How many years ago, but ueen Elizabeth has maintained the role of Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I went, I was very happy, she showed me.
And when I was watching, they were insistent on touching him and looking at him.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life and became part of his history.
I am sure that these habits do not change in the night and whenever they say that they have to become vaccine rich.
However, we have to say such things, we have to keep trying.
Now I can't say where I went and if someone gives me a blossom, I will deny it.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister has a lot of work.
However, I have developed a habit for myself that some of the letters that come to me, I read everyday and that gives me the opportunity to connect with the common man.
Very different types of letters are written by different types of men.
Just recently, I can get to read such a letter. I feel that I must tell you about it.
Arunmozhi Saranan, a resident of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, a far southern India, sent me a letter.
And what was the letter, he was writing that he thought of taking some or the other economic initiatives in keeping with the education of children in his family, so that the family could get some financial support.
I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and brought some goods from the market and started working towards supplying it.
Some people thought that I have registered it myself, I would like to tell the countrymen that you should also get an opportunity to get the E.
There is a new kind of arrangement to visit the EM.
Those who want to supply the goods to the government, want to sell the trees, want to sell the peacocks, send the table, they can register their names on it.
Those who register under EEGM, they see all the departments of the government.
Because of lack of agents many things are cheaper.
This Aurulmozhi Madamani has registered the items that they can supply at this point of view.
And it is immensely interesting that the letters they wrote to me are very interesting.
He has written that in one case he got the money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started, I have written a pledge for what I can supply on E-GEM and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what the Prime Minister's Office would have asked for.
This is an opportunity to promote innovation.
If Aurulmozhi didn't write to me, then I don't even remember that a housewife has been working far away in the E-GEM system, it can be purchased by the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
This includes transparency, empowerment and integrity.
Government e-Bazarpet-GEM
I want someone who has to sell his goods to the government in such a way should add more to it.
I believe that at least the government and the minimum administration are the best examples and what are these objectives - at least price and earnings, efficiency and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand, we can also be proud of our success in space science.
And this is the speciality of India that if our feet are on the ground for Yoga, then our dreams are also to overcome the skies of the sky.
Just a few days back, India has done a lot in sports and science.
Today, India is pushing its track not only on the ground but also on the space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 small satellites including satellites from Cartosat-2 Mallike.
And these satellites included around 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Briton and USA besides India.
And this small satellite drive in India will help in the field of agriculture and in the context of natural calamities.
Just a few days ago, you all remember that ISRO had successfully launched GSAT-19.
And it was one of the most weightful satellites that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers of our country compared it with the weight of the elephant.
So you can imagine how long our scientists have worked in space.
On 19th June, 1000 days of Mangal Mission were completed.
You all know that when we had successfully achieved the place for the Mangal Mission, it was for a period of 6 months.
While sending photographs, information, scientific information is being received, it has been working for more than the prescribed life.
It is important for our space travel to our scientific journey to complete a thousand days.
At present, we are also witnessing that the achievements of our youngsters are improving in the field of sports.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, greeted the people of India on the eve of Independence Day.
I congratulate him and his administrators on this victory.
Just a few days back, P.
T.
Usha's Usha Skill of Athletics inaugurated the Synthetic Track.
As much as we encourage sports, sports and sports.
Sports plays an important role in personal development.
The importance of sports in universal personality development is unusual.
There is no shortage of talented players in the country.
If the children of your family have the juice of playing then give them the opportunity.
They should be lifted up from the ground and closed in the room , should not be inspired for practice .
Even if they are able to practice, they can show shiny performances, but if they are interested in sports, then schools, colleges, families and surrounding people should encourage them.
Everyone has to dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget the summer of this year.
But the rains are waiting.
Today, while talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the advent of the holistic month of Ramzan, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of India and the people of the world, especially the Muslim community.
In Ramzan prayer , spirituality and charity are given great importance .
We are very fortunate to have made such traditions by our ancestors and today India can proudly proud of the fact that we can proudly proudly say that all the people of the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and those who deny God.
There are also idol worshippers and those who oppose the idol worship are also there .
There is every kind of thought, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition here and we have done the art of living together.
And in the end religion, communalism, be it tradition, be it tradition, all these messages give us the same message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This sacred month of Ramadan will help in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again congratulate all of you.
I am happy to say that many people have reacted to it.
Everyone showed me the enthusiasm to speak individually.
I have not read everything, I have not heard everybody's message, so many things have come up.
But after looking at these messages, some people have tried to learn music, some people try to put their hands on new words, some people are trying to learn new things by using YouTube.
Some people are learning art, some are learning dancing, some are doing dancing.
Some people have written that we have now started writing poems.
Some people are trying to understand the nature and live with nature.
I am very happy to note that I want to hear you a phone call.
"I speak Diksha Kathal.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much constraints have been made to give India freedom, how many freedom fighters have spent years in Turunga.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh who had achieved a lot in young age.
Therefore, I request you to give some message to the new generation about this.
I am happy that the young generation is keen to know about our history, about our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed for this country.
Innumerable great men have spent their lives in the battlefield for freedom, many young people have climbed the bottom of the fashion.
And that is why we breathe in independent India today.
We must have seen one thing that in the movement of freedom, the great men who had done a long time in Turunga, had done a great job of writing, studying and writing, also sacrificed Indias freedom.
A few years ago, I had visited Andaman Nicobar.
He had also visited the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book 'My Birth Anniversary' in Turunga.
He used to write poems, write it on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
How should the freedom fighters have suffered
When I read Savarkar's book 'My birthday', I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a sound light programme which is very inspiring.
There is no state in India, there is not a single language group of Hindustan, in which no one has spent his stars in the Turunga of Andaman for the sake of freedom.
Today, Veer Savarkar is the birth anniversary of every language speaker, every state and every generation of people.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
And who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must come out a world one will not see.
It is our duty to worry about the world we don't see.
If you are very suffocated then open the doors of the room, breathe in the fresh air and get a new consciousness.
When we come in contact with the five elements that formed our body, there was a new consciousness in our body, a new energy appears.
We all have experienced this, but we never take care of it, we don't build it in a pole, in a troupe.
After this, you must see that when we come in contact with our natural condition, there will be a new consciousness within us.
And therefore, the global mission to connect with the nature of June 5 should become our own mission.
We are getting some benefits from our ancestors protecting the environment.
Now if we protect the environment then the future generation will benefit from it.
And unforgettablely, it is the biggest guiding gland in the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth: Friends, Ahm is separated.
It is said in the Vedas that the purity that we have is due to the Earth.
Soil is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, then one thing is clearly visible that the birth of Lord Buddha, his knowledge and his supervision were done under the tree.
But in modern words, it is necessary to share with modern varieties.
Through Yoga, we have linked the world into a troupe.
Just as Yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, it is bringing together today.
Due to today's lifestyle, running and increasing challenges, it is becoming difficult to live a stress-free life.
It has been seen that this stressful mindset has been felt even from a young age.
In such a situation, Yoga has an important role to play in a stress-free life.
Yoga is the path of achieving health and well-being.
Yoga is not just exercise.
If you want to take an interaction with the health of your mind and thoughts and thoughts then it is possible through yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to the governments and all the leaders of the world.
Last year I have announced some competitions related to Yoga, some baks have been announced.
Gradually, work will progress towards that direction.
I have received an information and congratulate those who are invaluable imagination.
There is a very enormous information.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga. And for that, you should invite three generations of the family to do Yoga.
Azi-Azoba, parents, daughter-in-law, three generations should do yoga together and upload their photographs.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be a beautiful solution that will give Yoga a new path.
I am grateful to you for suggesting this idea and I am also sure that the way we had launched the scheme of selfie with augmenter and a very interesting experience was achieved, similarly, the pictures of three generations together will be waking up in the country and around the world.
You must send a collective picture of the people of those three generations where they are doing Yoga.
Tomorrow, there will be photographs of today and tomorrow, which will provide a boost to the golden future.
I am inviting you.
The International Day of Yoga is yet three weeks.
In a way this immunity is a movement for healthcare.
I invite you all to participate in this.
When you gave me the responsibility of my chief servant, when I got the opportunity to speak from the Red Fort on August 15, in my tenure, I had spoken about cleanliness.
Since then, my journey has been going on from different parts of India till date and I have noticed how Modi is going, where Modi is going, what Modi has done.
Because of this, I had a very careful telephone and I had never thought of what he said.
But I am grateful to them for bringing this thing in mind.
You can also hear this phone.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
On Modi ji TV and social media, I always see that wherever you go, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, according to your request, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
Moreover, it has not only been included in this, but children have also been aware of cleanliness.
Small kids are often seen blocking people from dirty roads.
The cleanliness movement that you had started from the ghats of Kashi has made your inspiration a movement.
It is true that wherever I go, the government machinery does not only work for cleanliness but recently it is also seen celebrating the festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before I reached there, seven days ago, a large number of cleanliness programs were started ten days ago.
Just a few days back, I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a huge cleanliness drive.
But I didn't know the relationship between these two things.
But after this telephone, I thought it was true.
We can imagine how much pleasure I might have had in this regard and the country is also taking into account these things.
What is the matter of joy for me that cleanliness is linked to my others
There is a habit of preparing the remaining for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness has become a major factor in it.
This thing is pleasant for anyone who loves cleanliness and is inspiring.
The idea is very good but I have to consider it.
But it is true that this movement should be accommodated and it is a good thing to visit the Amuk Tonne waste from the Cleanliness Mohai instead of giving some goods and memories.
It will be such a great mankind.
Once we started accepting this waste as wealth, many new methods of waste management will come up before us.
The youngsters associated with Start-Up will also bring new schemes and new instruments.
The Government of India has decided to open a big scheme for waste management with the help of the people of the city with the help of the State Governments.
On 5th June, about 4,000 cities will be equipped with solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of wastes will be provided, one of them will be green and the other will be blue.
Two types of wastes are being made - one wet waste and the other dry waste .
These wastes will be kept in four thousand cities and we should put dry garbage blue garbage and wet wastes in comparison to the schedule.
For example, the garbage that comes out of the kitchen, the vegetables, the food that is left, the bowl of the eggs, the bowl of the eggs, it is all wet waste and it should be put in the garbage of green color.
The other types of wastes include trash papers, shoes, iron, glasses, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken robes, rubber and metals.
I am confident that we will develop such a culture and when we have to move towards cleanliness every time we have to move forward in a new direction then we can fulfill Gandhijis dream of cleanliness.
Today, I have to mention one thing seriously that even if only one person decides his mind, he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is such a thing.
The people of Versova beaches have been legalised for nearly 80-90 weeks and thousands of tons of wastes have been wasted and now Versova beach has become clean and beautiful.
The entire responsibility of this work was taken by Versova Resident Welfare (VRV).
Brothers and sisters, Today, you have to tell me another thing with great pleasure and I am told that the 'Riyasi Block' of Jammu and Kashmir has become Hagnadari free under the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I congratulate all the citizens of the Republic of Block and the administrators of Jammu and Kashmir for giving them an excellent example.
And I am also told that the entire movement was a women living in the region of Jammu and Kashmir.
He cultivated the torch for waking up and inspired people from households and streets.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to those mothers and sisters, and congratulate the administrators there who have made a best start by making a block Hagnadri free on the land of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, from the last few days, from the newspapers, from the TV channels, from the social media, the present government's 3-year work has been examined.
I see this process as a positive sign.
This three-year period has been observed in every case.
People from every group of society have analyzed it.
I believe that some of the errors have been recorded and some of them have been recommended by Kautuk Kelan Gelany.
I also express my gratitude to those who have given technological and important responses.
If you look at the defects and deficiencies then you get an opportunity to improve it.
For an awakening nation, this visit is very important for an eternal nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you, and a good voice affects me as it will be on the minds of a common man.
It feels like I am sitting in the household, sitting in the family and looking into the things of the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, till we meet again, the weather has changed every corner of the country, the famine of the tests has come, the new students will start life and a new joy, new fragrance will come with the arrival of rain.
Come, let us all go ahead in such an environment by enjoying nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like the seeker, the contribution of people suffering from social problems is also seen on the other hand.
Every time the information that comes for Mann Ki Baat was analyzed in the government.
What kind of information are there, what are the problems and what are the experiences of the people
Normally it has been found that the nature of man is to give advice to others.
If someone gets cough in the railways, while going to the bus then the other comes and tells you that do this.
To give advice, to give information, it is like we have only in nature.
Most of the information providers are those people who try to reach me, who actually do something or the other in their lives.
And when we remember this thing, I felt that this is not a common information, it is a matter of experience.
Some people also make information because they feel that if these ideas are working there, if others listen to them and get a broader look then many people can benefit.
And therefore, they have a natural desire to mention this in Mann Ki Baat and these things are very positive in my view.
First of all, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the people who are the workers who are the workers and those who do something for the society.
Moreover, when I mention something then it is very enjoyable to remember something like this.
Last time, in Mann Ki Baat, some people had informed me, expressed concern about food and I had mentioned it.
And when mentioned, what was the use of innovative ideas for avoiding food from all corners of the country on the NARENDRAMODIAP
I have never thought that today, especially the young generations in our country have been doing this thing for many years.
We have heard that some social institutions are doing, but the youth of my country have been involved in this work.
Many have sent me videos.
There are several places where the bank of the ships is in progress.
In the bank of these vessels, people collect their own vessels, collect vegetables and take those necessary people from there.
The provider also gets relief and the guy does not feel unlimited.
This is an example of how to work with the help of society.
Today the month of April is completing, the last day is.
On 1st May, the foundation stone of the States of Gujarat and Maharashtra will be held.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
The two states have steadily tried to embrace the innovative peaks of development.
We have contributed to the progress of the country and inspired the lives of the great men in every field of the society, and in the memory of these great men, we should imagine that the state's foundation day, 2022, 75 years of independence, we should take our country, our society, our city and our family to where.
We need to make a plan to take up the resolution and move forward with the participation of all citizens.
Nature has changed all the rules of sports.
The summer in our country in May-June has been desirous of experience in march-April.
And when I was taking information from the people on Mann Ki Baat, people have been informed about what to do in the summer days.
s.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern over birds .
He said that in the weekend, the water should be kept at Gachchi and I have seen that small children in the family do this work very well.
Once they knew why they had to fill the water that they used to wash 10 times a day and see whether there is water in the utensils that have been kept and see whether the birds have come or not.
We feel that this is his sports actually going on but it is a wonderful experience in the minds of small children.
You can also enjoy a little bit of animals and birds.
Just a few days back, Shriyut Jagat Bhai has sent me a book from Gujarat, the Save the Sparrows and the number of chimneys that are decreasing in this has been expressed concerns, but what they have tried to protect them in the form of a campaign.
However, in our country, animals and birds and nature have been coloured with them, but it is important to boost such efforts in a collective manner.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had completed 100 years of Sayidana Saheb, the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra society.
He lived 103 years.
And on his 100th birthday, Bohra society had launched a very big campaign to save the pimples through the Burhani Statue.
I had the opportunity to launch it.
About 52 thousand Bird Feeders were distributed to the corners of the world.
He has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Winners.
Sometimes we are so busy, we cannot think about the days of summer, if we want water.
Young Friends, I have to make some efforts with you too.
Sometimes I am conscious that many of our young generations are enjoying living a comfortable life.
Parents also keep surrounding them in a preservative situation.
Some others are from the other side, but most of the comfortable conditions are visible.
Now the tests have been completed and plans have been made to enjoy the holidays.
It feels slightly alright despite summer holidays and summers .
However, I have to say something about how to leave for a friend.
I am sure some people will definitely use and tell me.
If you use this holiday, I offer three proposals, it is very good to do three of them, but try to do some of the three.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading in the book or listening from the acquaintances and feeling that thing is different from land and property in both of them.
Experiments should be positive and should be comfortable.
We are from the middle class families, we are from the happy family.
Sometimes I don't say that once again, do it.
During the evening, taking your football, taking a volleyball or taking any sports literature, go to the poorest village.
You will find that you play yourself with those poor kids, you can see that there is hardly any enjoyment of sports in life.
When the children living in this kind of life will get an opportunity to play with you, you have ever thought of how much change will happen in their lives.
And I am sure that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several voluntary organizations are doing service delivery work.
Sometimes there are very summer camps .
Personality is of development, there are many kinds of developments and can participate in it.
But at the same time you feel that you have done such a summer shirt, have practiced personality development and you have not taken any change to the people of the society who have not received such opportunity and teach what you have learned.
You can teach them how to do it.
I also express my concern that technology has come to reduce the gap and the technology has come to abolish the border.
Everyone has been busy with technology on the other hand.
Today is the age of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot in life is a good thing, the idea of doing something is a good thing and to do it.
But also look at whether the human elements that are inside us are not bitter or not, we are not far away from human qualities.
Can we put a little emphasis on skill development
Trying to spend time with yourself, avoid technology.
Any word in music, 5-50 words in a new language, whether Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
How many different countries are there and if we look at it then we can find anyone who teaches it around us.
If you don't swim, then learn to swim, pick up pictures, don't get a good picture, but try to swim on some paper.
The sensitivity within you will have to be expressed.
Sometimes we used to learn small things that we used to say.
You can see all these new experiments, these skills will also give you happiness and you will get rid of what you have built in a chowk.
Friends, Do something outside Chakori.
This is the opportunity to create a life.
And you are wondering if all the exams are completed and if you live on the new lines of the work then you will not get the opportunity.
And that is why I tell you that if you like to learn magic then learn the magic of your wife.
Keep on showing magic to our friends and friends.
Anything that you don't know will definitely benefit you.
The human power within you will be conscious and will be a great opportunity for development.
I tell you from my experience that we cannot imagine how much we can learn by looking at the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new campuses.
After going to one place, stay for three days and four days.
Then go to another place, stay there for three days, four days.
This will give you a lot of learning.
When you go, you must send me photos there.
Did you see new
Where would you go
You can tell your experience using Hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has also given you a great opportunity.
The new generation is becoming almost free from obstacles.
You can also earn from this scheme- you have thought.
There is a scheme of Government of India.
If you are downloading the Bhim App, you are also using it.
Your account will deposit 10 rupees from the government.
If you get it done by 20 people a day then you can earn Rs.
There can also be earnings for businesses and students can also earn.
And this scheme is till 14th October.
You will contribute towards creating digital India.
He was a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience used to say that the red lamp used to be on the vehicle, but slowly it turned the head and the VIP culture was deeply rooted in the head.
Now only the red light has gone, so no one can claim that the red lamp that has swollen in the head has come out.
I have received a very interesting telescope.
He has also expressed his gratitude in this telephone, but this time it is estimated that the common man does not like this.
He feels a kind of insufficiency.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Shiva Choubey from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I was very proud to note that today my time is equally important.
I don't want to stay in the desert and I don't want to stay for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my gratitude to you for this decision.
Reaching the Red Divya through government decisions is a part of the system.
But we have to expel it in our hearts too.
We can get rid of the efforts of all of us together.
Our concept of New India is that the importance of EPI instead of VIP in the country and when I call EPI instead of VIP, my feelings are clear - Ever Person is Important.
Everybody has the importance, everybody has the honour.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore countrymen, we accept the glory of 125 crore countrymen, then how much power will be able to fulfill the great dreams.
We all have to work together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we recall our history, our culture and our tradition.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating a thousandth birth anniversary of 125 crore Deshbandhu Saint Ramnujacharya.
Because of some or the other reason, we were so stubborn and so small that we had been thinking for more than a century.
Century will be very important for other countries around the world.
But India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to realize the memories of thousands of years and even more than a thousand years ago.
Just imagine.
Even today, how many problems are faced by the social customs.
How about a thousand years ago
He had done his behaviour to those who were considered untouchables.
Thousands of years ago he had called for the entry of his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are fortunate that in every age, great men have been born from our society to destroy the evil practices of our society.
While celebrating a thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramnujacharya Ji, we should inspire him to awaken this spirit for social integrity.
The Government of India will also release a postal stamp on 1st May in memory of Saint Ramanujacharya.
I extend my best wishes to Saint Ramnujacharya ji.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance of tomorrows 1st May.
It is also celebrated as a work day in many parts of the world.
And it is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar when there was talk of labour and discussion of workers.
And very few people would know that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the wealth that has been given to the workers today.
Baba Sahebs contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, Saint Ramnujacharya Ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka, Guru Basaveshwar Ji in the 12th century.
Tomorrow I got the opportunity to visit a function.
The programme was to dedicate his voluntary collection.
In Kannada, he said, "Whoever poet Kailash" means you can achieve the calamity of Lord Shankar's house, that is, by doing the work heaven.
In other words, this is Shiva.
I repeat myself with Shreya Jayate.
Today, when we talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattatop Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
Worldwide people associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals.
Buddha's ideas are very relevant when the world is facing problems like violence, war, destruction and hostility.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of this journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that this great festival of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations on Vesak Diwas.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get an opportunity to honour Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Their memories will provide an opportunity to light them.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of Sabka Saath SabkaVikas.
And when we call 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia satellite on 5th May.
The capacity and related facilities of the satellite will be very helpful in fulfilling the economic and developmental initiatives of South Asia.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
In most parts of the country, many families will be busy in the examination of their children.
Those who have been tested, there will be a little tension-free atmosphere and those whose examinations are still going on will have a little tension in those houses.
But this time I will tell you again what I had told the students through Mann Ki Baat.
At the time of exams, we will definitely use those things.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
On the other hand, a historic war against the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Wong-Bhain is an unprecedented victory.
Today, on this important day, I extend my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence and wish that Bangladesh progress, development, and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a supportive partner of Bangladesh.
We are a good friend and we will continue to take part in peace, security and development in this entire department.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are our collective heritage.
This is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first ASEAN person to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British also gave him the Nighthood.
When British in Jallianwala Bagh massacred the citizens in large numbers in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who raised their voices against this destruction.
This was the period when a 12-year-old child had a unique impact on his mind.
In adolescents, farmers, laughing in the gardens, those children who laughed in the gardens, had given a new inspiration to life by the illiteracy of the Jallianwala Bagh.
In 1919, the boy of the age group of 12, that is, the boys of all of us, the inspiration of all of us is martyr Bhagat Singh.
Three days before today, Bhagat Singh ji, his colleague Sukhdev and Rajguru had been expelled by the British on March 23, and we all know about the destination of March 23.
On the faces of Bhagatsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, there was no fear of death at that time.
He had sacrificed the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three brave men are still inspiring for us.
The words of the sacrifices of Bhagatsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be incomplete.
Just a few days ago, I had the opportunity to go to that place, I felt that there are specific messages on that land and I told the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity to go to Punjab, we must visit Bhagatsingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagatsingh, Matoshree and Batukeshwar Datt.
This was the time when the spirit of freedom, the intensity of freedom, its business was increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagatsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for a peaceful revolution.
So, just a hundred years ago, 10 April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
Champaran Satyagraha was clearly seen in the Indian Freedom Struggle, Gandhi thought and Gandhi style.
This was an important turning point in the entire journey of freedom, especially from the perspective of struggle.
This was the time when Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Ahmedabad Mill Workers' End and the thoughts and functioning of Mahatma Gandhi.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the statue of Gandhiji in our hearts.
Imagine that a person returns to India in 1915 and only two years of age.
The country didn't know them, they didn't have any effect, it was just the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they have to face and how hard they have to face.
Champaran Satyagraha was an event in which Mahatma Gandhis organization skills, the power to identify the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhis commitment to constitute, inspire, fight against the poorest of the poor, the uneducated, the poorest of the poor towards British Rajvati.
We could learn from them and the time when Gandhiji had sent all the big leaders who had heard the name of Gandhiji, that time, that Acharya Kripalani had sent them to the mattress.
And the British couldn't know what is the method of working of Gandhiji.
One side was conflict and the other was formed.
On the one hand, we had to work hard and on the other hand we had to bow down ourselves in constructive work.
It is an attempt to change the desire to change the lives of 1. 25 billion countrymen, so that the foundation stone of a New India will be laid.
New India is not a government program or a political party.
New India is an appeal to 1.
There are many people who often go to the hospital and serve the patients, many people who run for blood donation when needed.
Many people worry about the belly of the hungry people .
Our country is multiplied.
People's service that is, the Lord's service is buried in our nerves.
If we look at it in a collective manner and see it in an organised manner then it is such a great power.
If every citizen has concluded that I will follow the rules of transport, if every citizen decides that my responsibility will be accurately followed, if every citizen decides that I will not use petrol-diesel one day a week, then it looks so small.
You will see that the dream of a New India, the dream of a hundred and twenty-five crore people of this country will be fulfilled before our eyes.
It means that every citizen should follow his own religion and follow his duties.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you today.
In the past few days, there has been an atmosphere in our country that people have participated in digital payments and digital movements.
Different types of digital payments have been seen after demonetisation.
The BHIMP has been started in just two-and-a-half months but so far about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to fight against black money and corruption ahead.
Would you like to conclude two and a half billion digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
If they take care of this thing then there is no need to wait for one year.
This work can be done in six months.
Two and a half thousand crore digital transactions, if we are going to fill the school free, we will not fill the roads, we will pay digital payments in the journey of the railways.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several Digidhan Melas were organized for public education and public awareness.
There is a plan to make 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
There was also a scheme for Bakshis.
Approximately 125 lakh people have been blessed with the lucky consumer scheme.
70 thousand businessmen have earned their dues.
A big event will finally be held on the occasion of the completion of 100 days.
There is a system of great liberation.
I am confident that we will spread the Bhima Pacha in the days ahead of Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti.
Let us participate in how to use a reduction in cash and how to use the boats.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to say that every time I ask for information from the people for Mann Ki Baat, there are several kinds of information, but I have seen that there is always information about cleanliness.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, my greetings, first of all, I congratulate you all for your victory in these elections.
I want to tell you something in my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness themselves.
I go through the river everyday where most people pollut the river by putting garbage in large quantities.
This river flows from the Rispna bridge and also comes to my house.
I want to say that we should bring this thing to light through a group or a novel paper.
Brothers and sisters, how many problems are faced by the girl who learns indecently.
How much anger is felt by seeing garbage in the river .
I consider this a good symptom.
This is what I want that a tricolor should be created in the minds of 1.
Since the Swachhta movement has started, people have become aware.
Everyone has been positively associated with it.
Now this campaign has taken the form of a movement.
Thiruvananthapuram is going to increase the coverage of cleanliness.
Awakening, enhancing active participation, it has a different significance.
But cleanliness is more related to habits than movements.
This trend is a trend of changing habits and it is a trend to create cleanliness habits.
This movement can be in a collective form.
It is difficult to do but it is difficult to do it.
I am confident that the spirit that has awakened between the new generations, children, students and youth of the country is indicative of the best results.
Today, the message of guys who are listening to the message of Mann Ki Baat should be the message of guys.
Have we ever thought that how much we destroy this sour food that we add.
Have you ever imagined that if you don't waste food then how many poor people can fill their stomachs.
This is not a matter which has to be explained.
When the mother raises food to the child in her house, she says that the more she wants, the more she wants it.
Some efforts are being made but the sadness of this thing is a social treason.
This is injustice to the poor.
If the second issue is saved, then the family will get financial benefits.
I don't want to say much about this, but I believe that awareness should increase.
I am aware that some young people who run such a campaign.
He has made mobile pages.
Wherever such food is taken or released, they call other people and they use the food properly.
Young people of our country are doing such a thing.
We will find such people in every state of India.
Their lives also inspire us not to spend food but to increase food as much as they want.
There are ways to change the sight, those who are aware of the health, they always say that the stomach should be slightly empty.
I would like to tell the countrymen that sadness is not an impossible disorder.
A psychological environment has to be created and then treatment starts.
Its first mantra is that instead of pressing sadness, it should be clear.
Openly tell our colleagues, friends, parents, emotions and teachers what happens to you.
Sometimes the problem of loneliness is more for the students living in the hospital .
They don't come near the food table.
Have you ever noticed why he does this
We know that this is the first step towards sadness.
If he avoids living with a family, if he goes to a single corps then it will not happen.
See that those people with whom they ask openly.
Inspire him to express his smile and make it open where he has got a tumor in his mind.
This is the best solution.
Regrettability can become the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Just as diabetes invites all diseases , it reduces sadness on fighting , adventure , decision making ability and ends this capacity .
Your friends, your family and your environment can keep you away from getting sad and if you are sad, you can also get out of that mood.
There is another solution.
If we cannot open near our nearby people then do a job and go to such a place where the work of service is being done.
If we try to understand their misery, we will have a new self-confidence in our minds.
By connecting with others, by serving someone and by serving it with a sense of selflessness, the tension of mind becomes easier.
If seen then Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy .
Yoga is very useful for elimination of stress , freedom from depression , happiness .
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
We can also prepare from now on and celebrate the collective Yoga Festival in millions of people.
If we have to make some information about Yoga Day then we should reach me through my mobile application and guide me.
We can compose songs and poems about Yoga so that it can be easily accessible to the people.
But in the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is a welcome fact that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
He maintains the responsibility of the family and also has his hand in the financial responsibility of the house, which sometimes injustice to the newborn.
The Government of India has taken an important decision in this regard.
During delivery, during pregnancy, maternity Raza, who had been given 12 weeks earlier, will now be given 26 weeks.
Two or three countries in the world are ahead of us.
India has taken an important decision for these brothers and sisters.
Its basic objective should be to take care of the newborn who is the future citizen of India.
If she gets mother's affection in her child's condition, then she will be the country's grandeur tomorrow.
This will improve the health of mothers and therefore this important decision will benefit about 18 lakh women.
Let us get inspiration from the lives of all these great men and get the strength to concept for New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Years Pratipada, Nav Nav Navsatsar and this New Year.
It is time for the farmers to get the crop formed after the spring season and to get the fruits of their earnings.
New Year is welcomed in different ways in different parts of our country.
The New Year is welcomed in Gudhipadwa, Andhra and Karnataka, Ugadi, Sindhi Chetty-Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Sansar Puja in Awadh region, Judi-Sital and Magadh region in Mithila region of Bihar.
India is an innumerable diverse country.
My best wishes to all of you on this new year.
Many thanks.
The winter is over now.
Spring has entered the lives of all of us.
As a result of summer season the seeds of Indian gooseberry are seen in spring itself .
At the same time, the yellow flowers of peacocks in the fields create the minds of the farmers.
The dried flowers of pulses indicate the size of Holi .
Amir Khusro has described this change in nature as a joyous moment.
Amir Khusro writes, "Fool Rahi Saraso Gross Building, Ambava Pete, Tesu Phule, Coal Bole, Dar-Dar.
Whenever nature is pleased, the environment is pleasant, humans also enjoy this season.
The festival of Basant Panchami, Maha Shivratri and Holi fills the color of joy in human life.
In the atmosphere full of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are dedicated to the last month of Falgun and welcoming the next Chaitra month.
Spring is the confluence of these two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of people of the country for this thing that whenever I ask for my opinion before 'Mann Ki Baat' then I get a lot of information.
We recall this honourable achievement of India, thank you for this.
Whether it is poverty alleviation, disease alleviation, connectivity to the world, knowledge and information, technology has incorporated its importance.
15th February, 2017 is a glorious day of Indias lives.
Our scientists have enhanced India's mind before the world and we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several initiatives in the last few years.
In the last few days, ISRO has set up a global record in space sector after the successful completion of the movement under Mars Mission on Mangal Grah.
This success will not only be historic for ISRO but also for the entire country.
ISRO's Coast-Effective Identification Space Program has become a surprise for the entire world and the world has also explicitly congratulated Indian scientists for its success.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is one of the most important satellites, Cartosat-2D is Indias satellite and the use of Mola will be done for photographs, information, mapping, infrastructure development facilities, development information and urban development planning.
Especially to my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water resources are there in the country and how can they be used
It is also a matter of joy for us that our young scientists and our women scientists have led this kind of campaign.
This great part of the youth and women is a great pride in the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of all the people of the country.
These scientists have maintained and they are recording new records for the common man and for the use of space science for the service of the nation.
Whatever we congratulate our scientists and their teams, it will be less.
The scientists of India have shown this.
The capacity of this area is such that even from 2000 kilometers away, there has been a settlement to attack India, but our destination will destroy it in space.
We are happy when we see a new technology and find a new scientific research.
They are not healthy until they get the same answer.
And if we take a look at the journey of thousands of years of human excitement then we can say that this development journey is not a complete break.
New science, new technology are created from it and every technology, every form of new science, gives birth to a new era.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our young generation should be attracted towards science.
The country needs many scientists.
Todays scientists can become a cause of sustainable change in the lives of generations in the coming days.
Just a few days back, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs had organized a different kind of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Social useful research was invited.
Sometimes, in order to find answers, the problem only indicates the importance of science.
In 2005, there was a huge increase in Mumbai, the Mahapur came, the sea was also flooded and many problems were created.
Whenever there is a natural crisis, the biggest crisis comes on the poor.
Two people worked in this regard and developed such a system of householding which will save the household, save the lives of the household, save the water from coming home and save the diseases caused by polluted water.
Systems are also being systematic.
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, the emphasis has been on DG-Dhan.
Especially the youngsters have the habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I believe that this is a good symptom.
In the past few days, Bhagywan Consumer Plans and Digi-Dhan Business Plans have received good text.
About two months, 15 thousand people are getting one thousand rupees per day.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making digital payments in India a public movement has been welcomed across the country.
It is a matter of great happiness that today 10 lakh people have been blessed under the DG-Dhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand businessmen have got remuneration and more than Rs.
There are more than 100 consumers who have received one lakh rupees in the form of remuneration.
There are four thousand traders who have received a bread of Rs. 50-15 thousand.
Expressing happiness from Mysore, Shriman Santosh has written on the Narendra Modi App that he has received a reward of Rs. 1,000 in the fortune consumer scheme.
But I believe that he has written a very important thing to reach you.
He has written that he received a blessing of Rs. 1,000, while he remembered that a poor woman's house had been set on fire and all the things were burnt in the fire.
Satisfaction, our young and our work is satisfying us all.
We have done a very inspiring job.
Brother Sabir, a twenty-two-year-old cargo leader in Delhi, has now been associated with digital transactions and the fortunate consumer scheme of the government has got a borrowing of Rs. 1 lakh.
A young student from Maharashtra, Pooja Nemade, post-graduate practices, and how is the use of RuPay cards and e-wallets in his family and how much enjoys it.
One lakh rupees is important for them but they have taken this task as a gift and others are also linking it with it.
This movement is a great role in the fight against justice, corruption and black money.
Anti-corruption cadre of the country is an anti-corruption party in my view.
In a way, you are the soldiers of Shuchita.
On 14th April, a large amount of Rs.
There are more than forty-four days.
Remembering them, we should teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Teach me how Devan-Ghawan was there.
Teach the small and peasant traders around us in particular.
On this occasion, Babasaheb Ambedkars Jayanti and Bhim App will give special importance to this.
And that is why I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundations laid by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Going home, connecting everyone, we have to get a BHIM App up to 125 crore hands.
The movement that has started for the last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in many urban settlements, several camps and many cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture sector is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
Today I want to tell you a very happy thing.
Our farmer brothers and sisters, they have made a hard work and filled the paddy warehouse.
The hardships of the farmers of our country have resulted in record production this year.
All the records are telling us that our farmers have made all the records beforehand.
This year there has been a pool in the field that everyday it seems that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year more than two thousand and seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is eight times more than the previous sales in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented achievement.
I extend my best wishes to the farmers of the country.
It is also thankful for the fact that with traditional picks, we should produce pulses by considering the poor people of the country, because most of the proteins are found from pulses.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the sound of the poor and raised different pulses on about two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but also the poorest of my country.
I have a request, a prayer, my farmer brothers and sisters are eligible for special thanks for the manner in which my farmers buried and produced pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, from the government to the society, from the institutions and the organisations, everybody has started some initiatives in terms of cleanliness.
Somehow everybody is aware of cleanliness.
The government is also constantly making efforts.
Just a few days back, a programme of senior officers of 23 State Governments under the leadership of our government of our Government of India, Drinking Water and Sanitation has been organised here in Telangana.
What is the significance of the work of direct cleanliness not only in the closed room of Telangana state
Toilet Pitt Empting Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February .
The toilet pits of six houses were cleaned up and the officers themselves showed that they could use the pits used by the Twin pit toilets, empty and reuse them.
He also showed how comfortable toilets constructed using this new technology are and there is no difficulty in pursuing cleanliness while evacuating them.
As we sanify others and clean the pit of a toilet.
And this is the cleanliness of the toilet segment, in which we consider the garbage as a treasure, it is a kind of black gold.
We can see how wealth is created from waste to health.
A standard twin pit toilet for the family of six children is filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and delivered into another segment.
In six to twelve months, the garbage collected in the segment was dissolved.
Naitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are rich in nutrients and are considered to be very good in the field of farming.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken such initiatives.
Now this special programme has been started on television.
The more this kind of thing will be developed, the more it will benefit.
Different departments of the government regularly organise cleanliness pandharwada.
The Ministry of Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, in the second phase of March, will take forward the Swachhata Abhiyan.
We are convinced that whenever any citizens of our country do something good then the whole country feels a new energy and self-confidence increases.
We welcomed the work done by our disabled sportspersons in Rio Paralympics.
The country is proud of the success of these disabled persons.
I often believe that the disabled brothers and sisters are strong, determined and determined.
Every moment we can learn something or the other from them.
It is a matter of sports that in space science, women in our country are not behind anyone.
A few days back, our women association has silver medals in the Asian Ruby Seventions Trophy competition.
I congratulate all these sportspersons.
Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March.
In India too, the sensitivity should be enhanced to give importance to girls, to raise awareness about them in the family and society.
This campaign is going on at a rapid pace.
Today this was not just a government programme.
Today, a movement of social sensitivity and public education has been made.
In the last two years, this initiative has been linked to the common man.
This initiative has played a key role in considering this vibrant issue in every corner of the country.
It has brought about a change in the mindset of the people about the old traditions that have been going on for years.
Whenever the news is celebrated after the birth of the girl then it is very happy.
In a way, positive thinking about girls is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kundlore district has brought a ban on child marriage practice under a special campaign.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all departments have been linked with the 'Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Multi-Sectriberry' scheme.
In this program of 'Har Ghar Dastak' in Madhya Pradesh, education scheme is being started for rural and rural girls.
In Rajasthan, the initiative is being undertaken to inspire the girls who have left school to come back to school and to teach them.
New ideas are being linked to it.
It has changed as per the local requirements.
When we celebrate the Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling: "Women, who are powerful, who are women of India, who are empowered, who are empowered, who are empowered, who are empowered and who are empowered to do so," my dear countrymen, you all get the opportunity to interact with the minds of the people.
We would have been actively involved.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
It is a festival that reminds us of our commitment to the Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of the citizens and democratic rights, that is, a celebration that will create a democratic translation on the coming generations and make people aware about the responsibility of lobbying in democracy.
But in our country, there is no discussion as much as the rights and duties of the citizens should be discussed in this regard.
I hope that at every level, the more important rights should be given to the duties.
On this day, at 11 a.m. we pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country.
On 30th January, at 11. 00 a.m. this two-minute silence has to be a society, it has to become an easy nature of our country.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the families of the brave soldiers who have been honored with various gallantry awards.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Special Seva Medal.
I am particularly a leader of the youth of the country and you are very active on social media.
You can do one thing. You can search for the brave men who have received this honor and write two good words about them and bring them to your friends.
When we come to know about the bravery and valour of these brave men, about their valour and their efforts, we feel surprised and proud and inspired.
On the other hand, we were happy to save the news of the 26th of January, while the soldiers who were working to protect the borders of our country in Kashmir had to lose their lives due to the landslide.
I extend my best wishes to all the brave soldiers and congratulate them.
My young friends, you are happy that I keep telling you our Mann Ki Baat continuously.
Every month, January, February, March and April, is a long time for every family.
Nearly every household has an examination of one or two children but all the families were suppressed under that test.
Then I realized that this is the time for my students to interact with friends, their parents and teachers because for many years, wherever I go, wherever I meet, the test of children is seen to be very careful.
The family is contemplating, the students are conscious and the teachers are in deliberation. Such a strange mental state has been created at every house.
When I used to talk about this, many teachers, parents, students sent me a message, sent a message, some information, some problems and problems that would happen to us.
I want to express my thoughts to you today after reading all that.
I got a telephone message from the world.
Sir, I want to tell you that on the day of examination, there was a very terrible atmosphere in our homes, neighbors and society.
This will not only create the minds of the students but we also become sad.
I want to ask you that this environment cannot be pleasant.
The question is true, but it will emerge in the minds of all of us.
Very few people are those who are in the examination.
For most of the people there were examinations that were pressurers.
It is a rare preservation that you have to decide the issue of pleasure.
This exam will get the same fruit as the plasseur, which will be enjoyed and there will be a time for regrettable progress.
Therefore, I believe that you do not meet the exams as if they were a celebration.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family will play an active role in fulfilling this festival with enthusiasm.
The picture will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, every three-four months are tested.
For these three-four months, according to your traditions, change your family's environment in accordance with your traditions.
And that is why I will tell you, 'Small More, Score More.
In a stressful situation all the doors are closed and no one can go inside and the intestines are unable to come out.
The thought process stops and it is the burden of this thing.
And you don't have knowledge, there is a lack of information, there is a lack of consumption.
But when there is tension, your knowledge and information about you gets stuck under it and the tension takes place on it.
It is important to remember A Happy Mind is the safe for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we don't look at the exam from the right perspective.
It is our mindset that there should be a question of life and death.
This exam is just about what you have done throughout the year.
Your entire life will not be required there.
This is not an exam about how you have lived, how you have lived and how you have lived ahead.
Besides the exams that have been given in classrooms and professionals, you have gone through several episodes.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering.
J.
The biggest challenge I can see in today's era is to become an educational observation.
Markets are getting very important.
The competition has also increased and the stress on the minds of the students has increased significantly.
I want to know about the current trend of education and your thoughts about the future.
But Richa wishes to tell me something about this matter.
There is a limited use of quality and quality.
If you believe in these things then Mark will come back from you and you will never need to run behind them.
You will be able to use knowledge in your lives, your story will be useful, your self-confidence and determination will be used.
When you go to a lawyer to fight a big fight, do you see his Marksheet
The successful journey in the field of experience, knowledge and skills can be seen there.
Therefore, Market obstacles sometimes prevent us from going towards the right direction.
Richaji has also raised the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a very big mental fight.
It is easy to understand the examples related to sports.
Most of the successful sportspersons used to have their own competition.
Let us take the example of Sachin Tendulkar.
He has been traveling to know that he has been defeating himself for twenty years.
Therefore, it should be a wonderful thing because he followed the way to competition with others.
In every field of AYUSH, you have asked yourself about the same question, I could have practiced quietly two hours ago, why should I have three hours of practice
Earlier in the morning, it was too late to get up, why should you get up soon
Doesn't you have to sleep because of the stress of the test
He further said, "My mother was not very much learned.
However, he had to sit with me and leave mathematically.
I would like to tell the parents that they should fill up the three things, acceptance, learning and time.
The parents must have experienced that the expectations from their teachers and children are based on many problems.
The weight of yours will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask any questions related to the health of the patient.
He started listening to the shouts.
Within four-five minutes, the entire atmosphere was resolved.
Aravi keeps on frightening the patient talking about the diseases happening to the patient .
I have to tell my parents that sometimes we are aware of the fact that we are with children.
Have we ever thought that during the exams we should give the children a happy, laughing atmosphere
So, look, the atmosphere will change.
I have got a phone call from another big company.
He said, "Namskar, Prime Minister, I cannot say myself because my childhood has done the same thing.
I had tried to copy my childhood once.
And when I tried to make a direct copy, it was also caught and I had a lot of trouble with many friends around me.
These are the roads of short-cut because of copying.
You must have heard this several times.
I would like to say that again.
In any way, the effect of copying can be seen.
If you spend the same time on the issue of examination then it will not be necessary to copy it.
He said, "Namskar is the Prime Minister, my name is Monica. I am the 12th student, so I want to ask you some questions related to board exams.
My first question is about the growing tension during these examinations, how can it be reduced
In the days of examination, when I talk about playing and playing, your teacher and your parents will be angry with me.
During the examination, how are those Prime Ministers who tell children to play
Because it has been noticed in sports that we have a common understanding that the focus on studies is decreasing.
This idea is fundamentally wrong.
The problem is only there.
See the sky after coming out of your studies for two minutes, see the nearby trees, slightly light your heart and then sit in your room.
Be it for five minutes but give it yourself the rest time .
You will see that the work is going to be more sandalwood.
Everyone likes it or not, but my experience tells me the same.
There is no need to sit in the room for this.
Just stand under the open space, go to Gachchi, breathe for five minutes and then sit in practice.
Some people believe that if you wake up very late at night then you will have a lot of practice .
But not.
Definitely take as much as the body needs sleep .
Your efficiency will grow altogether.
Whenever I go for election campaigns, my voice is sitting sometimes.
At the same time, I had come to visit a folk singer.
He asked me, "How long do you sleep"
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously.
However, the people of your house will be angry at me.
It is a very thick medicine for consciousness of mind , intelligence and body .
Young friends, you are engaged in the preparation of exams and I am sitting in my mind.
Kunas Thakur, perhaps my speech will help in removing the tension of your mind.
But at the same time I also said that do not take care of what I have told you.
If you want to accumulate, don't do it or else you will also be able to make a burden.
I have also told your parents that you should not lose your weight on the children.
Our determination is to confront ourselves, ourselves, ourselves, ourselves and ourselves and ourselves.
My best wishes are with you.
In order to cross every cassette, make the same cassette the same as the festival.
And then there will be no examination.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Dear Countrymen, on 1st February, 2017, the Indian Teachers Party is completing forty years.
On this occasion, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the officers and young people of the Teacher's team for their service.
With 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured, the Indian Teachers team is honoured to be the fourth largest Teachers Group in the world.
As per our ideals, the soldiers of the Teacher's team are ready to protect the maritime borders and the maritime regions of the country.
Last year, the people of the Teachers team had done a proud job to cleanse the beaches of our country along with their responsibility.
Thousands of people had participated in it.
He is truly grateful for the sanitation of these beaches along with the safety of the beaches.
Very few people are aware that not only men but women are also doing their jobs with their shoulders and successfully performing it.
Our women officers of the Teacher's team are academic, observers and are also taking care of the responsibility of the lift.
Today, while the world-class security is a question of the window, I congratulate Indian technicians on their 40th anniversary to protect the beaches of India.
On 1st February, the Festival of Basant Panchami will be celebrated.
It is considered to be the period of the inception of the University.
Moreover, this is an inspirational period for the heroes.
The same inspiration is seen in the song 'Mera Rang de Basanti Chola'.
On the auspicious occasion of this Fisheries, I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen.
My dear countrymen, while spreading the message of Mann Ki Baat, the Akash Vani is also putting new colors in it with its imagination.
Mann Ki Baat gives you a great opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, many congratulations to all of you.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and commerce in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said that if the poor do not have our favour, then we have to accept it.
Saint Luke has written in Ganspel that Jesus has not only served the poor but also served the poor and this is the empowerment of the poor.
A story related to this is very popular.
It is said in that story that Jesus was standing near a temple treasury .
Many sages came and they performed a lot of charity.
After that a poor widow came and she put two copper coins in it.
Now if we go to see this, what is the value of two copper copper coins
There was surprise in the hearts of the devotees standing there.
Yessoon said that the widow has donated the most, and others have given it a lot, but this woman has donated everything to her.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Varanasi, where Malviyaji's address was placed.
I laid the foundation stone of the Mahaman Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Bhu-BHU in Varanasi.
Today is the birth anniversary of the Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, the country's pride in the field of nuclear power has also been enhanced.
Whether it is a party leader, a member of Parliament, a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji has created an ideal in every field.
On the birthday of Atal ji, I congratulate him and pray for his best health.
I was fortunate to have worked with Atal ji.
Many memories are waking up in front of my eyes today.
This morning, when I tweeted, I shared an old painting on it, I would certainly understand how Atal ji's affection would be in the form of a small worker.
Today, the people of the country will get the benefit of two schemes as a visit to the Nation.
In one sense, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn from each other and understand.
In order to promote this process, the central government's encouragement scheme for consumers and small businesses is being launched today to develop e-payment habits to strengthen mobile banking.
Fateful Consumer Plan is a scheme to promote consumers, while Digi Dhan Business Scheme is a programme to promote traders.
The scheme will start from today and the next 100 days will continue.
Every day 15,000 people will get a bid of Rs. 1,000 each.
In addition to this, one day will be released from a week to a week, which will provide a loan of Rs.
Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary will be a great festival on that day where crores of rupees will be provided.
Digi Dhan Business Yojana is mainly for businesses.
The traders should join the scheme automatically and include the consumers to prevent their behavior.
There will also be free bonds for such professionals and these bonds will also be in thousands of numbers.
The businessmen will continue their own business and they will also get the opportunity to live fortunately.
The scheme has been implemented keeping all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of these bids.
The poorest of the poor can also buy luggage by using USSD through Fitcher phones or ordinary phones, sell luggage, provide money and all of them can be beneficiaries of this Bakshis scheme.
In rural areas, AEPS can also buy and sell arrears.
30 crore citizens can soon participate in the Bakshad scheme.
This is very simple, it is easier for us to send messages from Whatsapp.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to see how to use technology in our country, how to e-payment and how to make online payments.
In the last few days, uninterrupted transactions have increased by 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The businessmen can guess how big this decision is.
The tax has been disbursed to the businessmen who will demonstrate digital routes, will provide online payment facility instead of hike in their business.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
A committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes and implemented them.
Someone told me that the Assam government has decided to pay 10 per cent of the wealth tax and business approval fees through digital payments.
The branches of rural banks which will be used by their consumers at least two digital transactions in the period from January to March will receive a bid of Rs. 50,000 by the government.
He has also announced a bid of Rs. 5 lakh under the Govt. of Digital Transactions for 100 Digital Transactions by 31st March, 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced a loan of Rs. 5,000 to the first ten farmers who have fully debited the purchase of seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Agricultural Scheme for the farmers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all the governments who have taken such initiatives.
Several organisations have successfully experimented in promoting digital demonstration among poor farmers in the villages.
Someone told me that Gujarat Narmada Khore, Accounts and Chemical Married Companies have set up POS machines at the places where the fertilizers are being sold for the convenience of the farmers.
It is a matter of pride that the sale of consignments of the company has increased by 27 percent this year compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, Informal sectors have increased in our economy, and we know that most of these people are given loans, money, money, money or wages, and that is why the laborers are exploited.
Where 100 rupees are required, 80 rupees are available.
They are also entitled to the benefits of other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easier for us.
The country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth has also made a lot of progress in the field of start-ups.
These are the golden days of digital movement.
Our youth can empower this sector with new ideas, new technologies and new ways.
At the same time, we should also participate in the campaign to liberate the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I invite people to ask for their advice before the news of Mann Ki Baat every month.
In this context, 80 to 90 percent of the suggestions received on MyGov and Narendra Modi are related to the fight against corruption and black money.
When I saw all this, I shared them in three parts.
Some people have written in detail about how to face the problems and the problems of the people in the advice given to me.
The other types of people have written that how to find new ways for the welfare of the country, however, wherever such a sacred work is being done.
The third kind of people have written that the fight will continue in support of what happened.
The number of people who call for corruption and black money should be completely eliminated and they should also take strict steps to ensure that necessary steps are taken.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those people who help me send a lot of letters.
Shri Gurumani Keval said that this step taken to completely stop the behavior of black money is eligible for curiosity.
We are fighting against corruption and black money like lenders.
The words written on the boats are wrong, the rates of sweets have increased, the robbery of two thousand rupees will also be cancelled, the robbery of 500 and 100 rupees will be cancelled.
But after listening to all these words, the minds of the people of this country were stunned.
Moreover, many people landed in the plains, they brought the true face of those who spread their wisdom through their talent and intellect and proved it wrong and brought the truth to everyone.
My best wishes to the people.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that there is nothing impossible when 1.
Janta Janadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for this great personality of corruption and black money.
I felt that there should be a comprehensive discussion on the fight against corruption and black money.
If Sadan had worked, it would have been a good discussion.
Some people are spreading all kinds of wealth to the political parties, they are completely wrong.
The law is the same for all.
Be it individuals or organisations or political parties, everybody should follow the law and everybody has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in search of government errors.
There is also a question of repeated change of rules.
This government is for the people.
What power has been involved in this periodic behavior of dishonesty and corruption for 70 years
When I decided to fight such people, they started new efforts everyday to defeat the government.
On the other hand, a number of people have also written discussions on the ongoing non-violences and various aspects.
The public is giving more information than the information received from the government system.
The success achieved by us is due to the awareness of the common people.
In order to provide such information, the government has created an e-mail address, which can be sent to them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who write such letters and their letters are confident and blessed.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of tiredness, there is no question of stoppage and for the work for which 125 crore citizens get blessings, there is no question of forgiveness.
We must have been aware of the law in terms of Anonymous Property in our country.
So it was kept in the basin.

My dear countrymen, this time, the session of Parliament made the citizens of the country despair.
There was a feeling of jealousy in the functioning of the Parliament from all over.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their gratitude for this.
But in such a situation sometimes there are good things and the heart gets relief.
There was a good work in the Gadarol in the Parliament but the country did not notice it.

This is a new year that will give a chance to the poor to live a happy life.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for the year 2017.
Thank you very much
Like every year, I had visited India-China Sewer to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the higher areas of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of ITBP and the soldiers of the army.
But the experience of this Diwali was different.
The same reflections were reflected on the faces of every citizen of the country, the manner in which he dedicated to the soldiers of the Diwali community and dedicated them to the security forces.
Some poets, some poets, some portraits, some cartoons and others made videos.
I am surprised when I read these letters.
These letters are full of feelings.
At the same time, there was an information on 'My Gov' that can the same coffee table book be made by gathering selected things in it
A young man from our armed forces wrote to me, Prime Minister, the Holi of our soldiers, Diwali, every festival is on the border.
As if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, how will we have the feelings that we have expressed about our army team in this Diwali, just in a few contexts.
I urge you to take this habit as a society, as a nation, as a nation. Any festival or festival, somehow we should remember the soldiers of our country.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of our army increases by 1.
Just a few days back, the Sarpanch of the state of Jammu and Kashmir had come to visit me.
He was a member of the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Summit.
He had come from different parts of the Kashmir Valley, about 40-50 people.
I got the opportunity to speak to them for a long time.
He had brought the issue of development of our villages.
They had some demands and when our dialogue started, the issue of environment, law and facilitation, the future of children in the Kashmir valley came out.
In Kashmir, schools are set on fire, they have been disturbed by talking about it and I have seen that as much pain as all our countrymen were suffering.
He said that the future of the children is not a school but a hall.
I urged them to take care of the future of these children.
Just a few days back, the board was tested and about 95 percent of the students and students of Kashmir were tested by the children and girls.
I congratulate him for his excitement, but I congratulate his parents, his parents, his teachers and the Sarpanchs of all the villagers.
Dear brothers and sisters, when I asked for information from you for Mann Ki Baat, I can tell you that everybody has sent information on the same subject.
Everyone used to say in detail about 500 and 10000 notes.
I also used to imagine that we have to face many new problems in our daily life.
It is not easy to get rid of the disease that we used to face for 70 years.
I can understand the difficulties faced by you.
500 thousand loans and such a large country, such a move, a long-term loan and a decision.
The entire world is watching the barracks and every economist analyzes this very well.
More than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends and day-night have been associated with the spirit of dedication.
Despite many kinds of tensions, they are working with a very quiet mind, considering this work as a sacrifice for the service of the country as an attempt to a great change.
Start in the morning, when will it be completed at night
Suddenly money was needed.
Several such events have emerged everyday from TV, newspapers and discussions.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those colleagues who have worked hard in this greatness, who have worked hard for men.
The power was recognized only when success came after the casualties.
I remember Changal, when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank servants took the burden of it on their shoulders and they used to show that the work that was not done in 70 years.
Today, once again he has accepted the challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians will provide a new strength to the nation.
But bad habits have spread so much that many people still do not have those bad habits.
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, anonymous money, some of them will find some ways and bring them back to the system.
They are looking for unfair ways to save their money.
It is sad that he has chosen a path to use the poor.
They are trying to save the money by paying the money in their accounts or by doing some work from them, by illustrating the poor.
I would like to tell such people today, whether to improve or not, whether to improve or not, our will, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the laws, the integration, the laws, the integration, the laws, the integration, the integration, the integration, the integration, the integral, the integral,
But don't play with the lives of the poor.
And the government does not want our countrymen to be in trouble.
I am a common citizen of Thirali village, Taluka Triali, J. Hadra, Madhya Pradesh.
It is commendable that we have shut down the notes of five hundred and thousand.
I wish that many such examples have been brought in front of the people from the point of view of my heart that people welcomed these hard steps for the upgradation of the nation even after having lost their lives.
Because we say that good days will come, but no one knows how long we will take steps.
People of black money and corruption have got a good fight after seeing all this.
There will never be better days for every Indian.
It is so happy that it feels so proud that the common man of my country has a unique power.
People go there, eat and when they go there again after 2-4-6 days they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country, including service, diligence and authenticity.
During the election, I had launched the 'Chay Pe Charcha' programme and had done this thing all over the world.
But I don't know that weddings are being held in the Chai Pe Church.
In Gujarat, a girl has only given tea to the people who have come to her marriage.
Once I saw the news on TV, when I was late in the night, I was looking at it and this name is Dhekiyazuli in Assam.
What did they do when they got a loan of Rs. 2000
Nearby and neighbouring four women came together and they went to the market and shopped together and used a boat of Rs.
See how the lives of the treasury are changing.
Some people benefitted from this scheme.
I got information about the small towns.
It has been reported from about 40-50 cities that due to the closure of these boats, people did not pay the money to the others.
And we are aware that the poor people don't pay the money two days back.
Those big people who have no identity, those who knew that no one would ever think of them, they do not pay the money and that is why they are very tired.
Each municipality receives 50 of the tax revenues.
However, due to the decision of the 8th line, all of them were running to submit their old notes.
Last year, about three and a half thousand crore rupees were deposited in 47 civilian departments.
You will be surprised to hear and you will also be happy to know that in a week, Rs. 13 thousand crore has been deposited with them.
But I congratulate the farmers of my country today.
I was taking a recent survey of the crop production in this season.
The farmers have also discovered the path even after having difficulty.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Small traders in our country send jobs and help in increasing the economy.
Just like the big malls, the small shopkeepers of the village will also be able to do their business for 24 hours, no law will stop them, I believe that the big malls are available for 24 hours or not.
Through the Mudra Yojana, they were encouraged to pay their loans.
But this decision made it easier for them to face problems.
I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is an opportunity to enter the digital world too.
We also download the bank's page on our mobile phone and we also keep POS machines for credit cards.
Learn how business can be done without using the ship.
We can see that through the medium of big malls and technology, a small businessman can also enhance his business through a common Younger Friendly Technology.
There is no possibility that there will be no deterioration.
I invite you that we can contribute immensely to the creation of cashless society.
There are ways of technology, they are safe, they are comfortable and swift.
I am confident that I want to convey my best wishes to the hardworking brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
But friends, you are my colleagues, my colleagues.
We have a unique opportunity to serve Mother India and we have the opportunity to take the country to the economic peak.
The older generation is not as much experience as we have.
We know that earlier generations do not know what they used to do.
We know how online banking and online ticket booking can be done.
There is nothing special in it.
But today, the great work that the country wants to do, which is your dream, the cashless society, it is true that 100 percent will not succeed but we have not started it.
If we start the cashless society then the goal is not far away.
Wallet is e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards.
However, after 8th century, the poor have started using RuPay cards and its use has increased by about 300 percent.
Just as printed cards are available for mobile phones and printed cards are available for bank accounts to spend money.
It is easier to work as we send a Whatsapp.
I am sure that the uneducated person should forward the Swachh Wattsup.
Not only this, technology is easier than it is that there is no need for smart phones for this work.
Whether it is smoke, vegetable seller or milk seller or current jewellery or tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have emphasized on making this system more easier.
All banks are working on this.
We must have read in the present letters of the last two-four days when we used such cards which have been supplied with the need to take charge.
The technology required to spend online will be in our mobile phones.
Not only this, we should tell at least ten families about half an hour, two hours a day, how technology is used, how can we download our banks
We have to undertake this campaign to liberate the country from the clutches of cashless societies. The campaign to liberate the country from corruption, the campaign to liberate people from the problems and problems.
I believe that if this system is taught to the common people then it will get rid of the thoughts of work and if all the youngsters of India blame themselves in this task then it will not take long.
Within a month we can stand as a modern Hindustani in the world.
And we can do this through mobile phone and we can go to 10 houses every day.
I invite you not only to stop with support but also to make changes to the army and to make changes.
We have taken this fight to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the youngsters of the country have changed their lives and the revolution took place from the youth.
M-PESA, which was determined by Kenya or the country, built a mobile system, using technology, called M-PESA.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to work in schools, colleges, universities, NCCs, NSS, collectively and individually.
The most popular artists of this century, Amitabh Bachchan, are moving ahead with the Swachhta Mission.
It seems that cleanliness is soaked in their nerves and that is why they remember the work of cleanliness on the day of their fathers Jayanti.
He writes a poem of Harivansh Rai ji, one of his poems, one of them, the body of soil, the life of fun, my familiarity, the identity of Harivansh Rai dynasty.
My dear countrymen, today I have been associated with my thoughts, feelings, letters, my voice and my heart through the words.
At 11 o'clock, Mann Ki Baat programme will be broadcast, but we will soon be able to hear its translation from regional languages.
Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other.
Festival is the second name of the lives of Indians, and it is natural for anyone who sees it from a distance.
The tradition of festivals of India has been changing since the time of Vedas.
But in all these journeys, one thing is that the entire journey of the festivals that take place in India is linked to it, its prosperity, its inclusiveness and its impact on the people's mind to the nation.
The basic objective is to expand individual and personality, to try to expand our limited thoughts from society to the universe and to achieve all this through the festival.
Our ancestors have incorporated this thing in a scientific way that how the weather is, how the food should be taken in the environment, how the farmers should take crops, how to celebrate the day of pick up, how the culture of health should be included in the festivals.
Today, the whole world is discussing the environment.
This destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
The tradition of the festival of India is not only affectionate for nature but it is going to give essence to everybody from children to the eldest.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate the festival that creates a sense of responsibility for each.
We take holidays on Sunday, but we used to take vacations on the day of Amavasya and Poornima.
This darkness is not the darkness due to lack of light but it is also the darkness of darkness.
It is an effort to brighten the darkness of the society, to remove the darkness of the fault of the person, and to illuminate the light of positiveness on the day of Diwali with the same thought.
The household of the poor is a mud utensil, but it looks shiny and shiny during the days of clean Diwali.
From that point of view, Diwali is also a mission of cleanliness.
But not only in the house but also in the entire premises, cleanliness in the streets, cleanliness in the entire village is the need of today.
On this occasion, we should expand this tradition of cleanliness.
This festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world.
Many governments around the world want to participate in the festival of Parliament and Administrator Diwali.
You might be aware that the American Postage Service has issued a postal stamp on Deepawali this year.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his photographs on Twitter on Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Britain organized a glorious event to gather all the societies on Diwali in London and also participated in it.
There is no such city in Briton where Diwali is not celebrated with great enthusiasm.
What is the photograph that Singapore's Prime Minister has photographed on Instagram and has shared with the entire world with pride
While 16 women MPs from Singapore are standing outside the Parliament from the Indian Parliament.
He said that the Prime Minister of New ealand had come here recently, we have to return to New ealand to attend the Diwali celebrations.
This festival of Deepawali is also a festival of inspiration from darkness to light to the global community.
In the festival of Diwali along with new clothes and food items of different tastes , plaques are also played with great interest .
Children and young people like bursting.
Children, but sometimes they don't get enthusiastic, they try to make a big sound at the same time and invite a huge crisis.
There is a possibility of burning fire around us.
In the days of Diwali, news of such accidents, news of fire, news of immunity, is a matter of concern.
During the days of Diwali, many doctors are also busy celebrating Diwali with their families.
The festival of Diwali takes place in our country for a long time.
While celebrating the festival of Deepawali, we also prepare Chhathpuja.
The festival of Chhathpuja is a big festival in the eastern part of India and this festival is celebrated for four days.
This festival also gives a very meaningful message to the society.
Whatever the Sun God gives us, it is difficult to recognise what we receive from the direct and indirect Sun God.
Chhath Puja is the festival of sunset .
It is said that people in the world worship the rising sun.
But Chhathpuja is a festival where Movement Sun is also worshipped.
A large social message is also given through that.
My best wishes to the soldiers of the army in the world for this sacrifice, penance and hard work. And with the same spirit, I felt that the lamp of Yeda should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the countrymen for the Communications to Solutions.
Today I would like to say that there is no feeling of love, pride and respect for the people of the country.
The way this feeling has been expressed, every citizen has shown a speedy power.
Through the messages of all of us, our security forces have got new patience and patience.
Nobody has inspired the youth of our country, nobody has instructed, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, the school, college, the students, the village, the poor, the businessman, the shopkeeper, the political leader, the sportsperson, the actress, all of these have expressed their feelings.
The media has also considered this Deepotsav as an opportunity to express gratitude to the soldiers.
Today we celebrate Diwali, while someone is standing in the desert, someone is on the peaks of the Himalayas, someone is protecting the industries, someone is watching the security of the airport and all these young people are performing innumerable pockets.
I can imagine how glorious it will be for my countrymen.
Innumerable emotions have been expressed on the message to solvers on the Hashtag.
Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has sent a poem and I feel like reading and showing it.
I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion of Diwali.
My elderly and both mother-in-law were empowered in the army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
There are many of our officers in the Army Circle on the border of the country who are receiving good messages and are boosting them.
I would like to assure you that along with the officers and youngsters of the army, their entire family and their wives also perform great sacrifices.
Through our messages, the entire community is getting a good message and I wish you all the best wishes for Diwali.
Whether it is a natural calamity, a problem arising out of law and order, whether it is to hand over two hands to the enemy or to bring back the youth from the wrong path, our youngsters are inspired by the nation towards every leadership of life.
I would like to tell you what I can inspire you to achieve success.
We have an ITBP member in the security forces, Vikas Thakur, a resident of Chhotayasha village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
The name of his village is Badhana.
Our youngsters of ITBP had gone to their villages during their holidays.
That is why Himachal Pradesh has been a true state of open defecation.
Very few people go to those villages.
The engineering students of the city, who are far away from that village, have not had toilets at this place.
NCC Chatra, NSS member and engineering students decided to build toilets in this village.
All the items, Vita, Symmetry and other necessary things that are required to build toilets have been brought to the village by placing it on their shoulders and placing it all day long.
The youth built toilets in that village after their own hard work and showed them a small village in the remotest part of the forest.
That is why Kerala too will soon be the open defecation free state.
Gujarat has announced that more than 150 locations are open defecation free.
10 districts have been made open defecation free.
On November 1, Haryana will celebrate its Golden Jubilee Festival and they have decided to make their state open defecation free within a few months.
So far, 7 districts have been opened and defecated.
Work is going on at a fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only some states.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for their contribution to the elimination of darkness in the form of integrity of the country.
My dear countrymen, there are several government schemes and after the first scheme, they have to stop the first scheme after presenting such a second scheme.
But generally nobody notices these things.
The old schemes are initiated, new schemes are also initiated and the schemes are expected to be taken.
The houses in which gas is used for cooking in our country are not required for kerosene.
He has taken a big decision to release kerosene from Haryana.
I am confident that Haryana will soon be free from kerosene.
Only the mediators and the teams will be blamed for this.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been a guide for all of us.
It is time to pay attention to the aspirations that have been created in the minds of the poor people of the country.
We have to take one step in order to get out of the contract.
However, the difference between the son and the daughter should be lost in society.
Now there are free toilets for children and girls in schools.
This is the opportunity to give our daughters a feeling of discrimination free India.
It is not right to spread darkness in the entire village after the desolation of 21st century.
In order to free such villages from darkness at the earliest, the scheme is being successfully implemented to provide electricity to them.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to five crore families.
The small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, small shopkeepers, all of them were stuck in the worst cycle of savvy wages.
Several people have been liberated from this evil cycle of interference through Missions like Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Accounts.
Through Aadhaar, direct money is deposited in banks, so that they reach directly to the beneficiaries.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of the common man from the mediators and the party.
My dear countrymen, it is 31st October that the great personality of this country, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, has dedicated his life to the unity of India.
You will be surprised to note that Sardar Patels Jayanti is on 31st.
Sardar Patel took away his entire life for connecting the country and he was successful in his campaign and brought everyone together.
At the same time, Durdev said that on the same day Indira Gandhiji was killed.
We all know what happened in the country after their assassination.
Sir, I think what can I do to prevent such a mischievous incident
My dear countrymen, this is not just the sadness of one person.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of uniting the country.
This injustice done to Sardar ji's birthday, the birthday of that great man who lived for unity, is painful for all of us.
But we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
The unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is a number of languages or a number of ethnicity or a number of different types of diets, but unity of diversity is the strength of India, it is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore the opportunity to establish unity and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to avoid and save the country from the thoughts of spreading steadfastness.
Sardar Saheb has given us an India, it is our responsibility to make it the best India.
The basic mantra of unity lays the foundation stone of the best India.
Sardar Saheb's life began to see the farmers' struggle.
But Sardar Saheb not only took initiatives for the struggle but also for constructive work.
I extend my best wishes to Sardar Saheb and on 31st October, we recall him wherever we are, we should conclude unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a festival of light in this series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are guided not only for the entire humanity, but for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and goodwill were their original mantras.
Each teaching of Guru Nanak Dev was aimed at liberating society from discrimination, superstition and mischief.
Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his co-operative at the time when he had reached the boundary of such disorders, caste systems and high-level.
Let us take forward the mantra of Sabka Saath, SabkaVikas, which inspires us to work against discrimination and to promote knowledge like Sudha Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
My dear countrymen, once again I wish you all all the best for this Diwali dedicated to the people of the country.
I extend my best wishes to all of you that our dreams, our resolves, our lives are fulfilled, our lives are in joy and happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
In the recent terrorist attacks in the Uri sector of Jammu Kashmir, we have lost eighteen brave soldiers of our country.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our army.
He will lay the foundation stone for every such thing, and will lay the foundation stone for the efforts to enjoy the lives of 1. 25 billion people of the country.
But the army doesn't speak.
Today, I would like to speak to the people of Kashmir specially.
The people of Kashmir are now well aware of the anti-national forces.
And as the truth is known to them, they have started moving on the path of peace by separating themselves from such ideas.
Every mother-in-law feels that schools and colleges should work at the earliest.
Fruits made in the fields and fruits are expected to go to the markets across the country.
Economic behavior seems to be smooth.
And for the past few days, this behavior has started to be smooth.
For our future generations, we have to achieve new summits of development.
I am confident that we can find solutions to every problem together, find ways and provide better ways for the future generation of Kashmir.
The security of the people of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I get the opportunity to learn a lot through social media.
There is an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings and feelings of every kind of people from every part of India and this gives strength to democracy.
The young man named Harsh Vardhan, who is a learner of academicity, recently asked me a different idea.
Then I conclude that I will practice more than three hours a day.
I will be a citizen of the country.
I am glad that you can imagine this kind of peaceful thought in such a small age when you are in the environment.
But, Harsh Vardhan, I also want to say that the entrepreneurship in the minds of the people of the country is a huge price.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
This entrepreneurship shows the determination to do something.
Everyone feels like doing something or the other.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri tried to touch this spirit of the country in a very best manner.
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan had inspired the common man of the country to work for the country.
One more way to express patriotism in the voices of Bombs and Bandus is to every citizen and it has been shown by Lal Bahadur scientists.
My dear countrymen, Shriman T.
Kartik has written on the Narendra Modi Pavilion that the myth for the Paralympics Competition has created history and the sports shown by him is the victory of human consciousness.
Shri Varun Viswanathan has written on the Narendra Modi Pavilion that our Thalitan has done a very good job, we should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only both of us, but every person in the country has been associated with our sportspersons in Paralympics.
Further, these paralympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have made a complete transformation in the attitude of humanity towards the disabled.
And I cannot forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik ji said.
When he won the medal, he said that this medal has served me with disabilities.
There is a lot of strength in this twist.
This time 19 athletes had participated in the Paralympics competition with three women in our country .
In comparison to other sports, when the disabled plays, physical ability, sports skills are more important than this.
You will be surprised to hear that our sportspersons have done the best job of today, achieved four medals and earned two gold, one rope and one bronze medal.
Devender Jhazaria, who won the Gold Medal, won the second Gold medal in Bhalafaki.
And he was not disabled when he was born, because of the shock of the winner, he had to lose one hand.
Think about the first golden silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver.
Maryappan Thangwelu won gold medals in a high jump.
He does not live in a big city or even in a middle class Mrs.
In the 21st year of age, despite physical complications, he gave medication to the country on the strength of the determination.
Thollet Deepa Malik has earned only in pushing the window.
Varun C.
Bhati won bronze medals in a high jump.
Very few people will be aware that at this time, the people of the Disabled people have made an endeavour in the Paralympics competition.
Not only that, I wondered when I came to know that the players who were in the fourth position in the running competition would not get medals, but he completed the race in less time than the Gold medal winners in the bulk run-up competition.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving towards creating a simple scheme for the development of Paralympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibira for the persons with disabilities and many worldwides were recorded at that time.
The entire Ramayana is poetically composed of the jungles of Gauri Shardul and that of Nang district.
And when I heard the people gathered there, people were surprised.
On that day I got the opportunity to inaugurate a book and collect the success story of the lives of the persons with disabilities.
This experiment was registered in the Guinness Book of World Records .
It is a matter of great pride for all our countrymen to be divided into three-three worlds.
My dear countrymen, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the birth anniversary of the legendary Bapu two years ago.
And the same day I had said that cleanliness should be a habit, every citizen should be duties and the atmosphere of tricolor should be created about cleanliness.
When two years will be completed on October 2, I can assure you that awareness about cleanliness has increased in 1. 25 billion people.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we all can say that everybody has tried to move one pound ahead.
Therefore, everybody, whether it is ordinary citizens, government offices or roads, bus stations or railway stations, schools or colleges, religious places or hospitals, from children to senior citizens, rural poor women, everybody is contributing to cleanliness.
The friends of the media have also played a positive role.
I want us to move ahead.
This is also important and therefore, if we want to tell about rural India, two crore and a half million toilets have been constructed so far.
A Nicope competition has been started in the States, districts and districts, in villages and villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve full success in the Haagandi free village campaign.
Congratulations to those who have worked, and those who are trying for this.
And I would like to appeal to the countrymen that for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the sake of children, we have to free the country from this problem.
Let us take this resolution forward.
Especially my young friends, I want to present a scheme for those who use multiple technology.
By calling on this 1969, we will not only be able to know the situation of building toilets in our city but also ask for toilets.
We should take advantage of this, especially the youngsters should take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also called upon the corporate sector to come forward.
They should provide sponsorship to young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the district as representatives of Swachh Bharat Mission.
It has been told that the fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the fertilizer that will be produced from the waste.
The farmers who are doing organic farming have been asked to provide the fertilizer to them.
Those who have to improve the health of our soil, those who are careful about the health of the soil, those who have suffered due to the use of chemical fertilizers have been told to provide these fertilizers as per their requirements.
And Shriman Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing to this work as a good friend.
I am inviting youngsters to start a new start-up in the field of waste to wealth, to develop machines required for them, to develop technology.
This is definitely a task.
An Indonesian Sanitation Conference is being organised this year from 25th September to 3rd October.
The Prime Minister, the Chief Minister of the country, the Mayor of the City, will meet together and discuss only cleanliness and cleanliness.
What can be technology
What can be the economic policy
How can the public participation be achieved
How can it create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new news about cleanliness is coming continuously.
Recently, I had read in the newspaper that the students of the Gujarat Technological University went to one hundred and seven villages and launched a awareness campaign for the construction of toilets.
He worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, we have also seen that a team under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh swimmed 2800 km from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar under the leadership of Shri Paramveer Singh.
Different departments of the Government of India have created their own vision.
Every department pays attention to cleanliness by deciding 15 days.
In October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Department of Panchayati Raj and the Department of Rural Development will come together to create a framework for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And in the last two weeks of October, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and the Ministry of Consumer Welfare will launch Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective areas from 16th to 31st October.
I appeal to the citizens that we should also participate in the departments with which we are concerned.
You must have seen that surveys related to hall cleanliness are conducted.
Earlier, surveys were conducted in 73 cities and what is the situation about cleanliness in the country.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind in this regard, now we will do something better.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I am confident that all of us will contribute to it.
On 2nd October, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri are celebrating.
I have been insisting on buying Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
I am also saying that there should be only one thing of khadi in our family so that the need for Diwali can be applied to the poor.
Can we join the Swachhta Abhiyan for ourselves
Two hours, four hours, we will attend the work of cleaning and I will tell you to take a photo of it and share it with the Narendra Modi Pavilion.
If you have a video, share your video.
See, our efforts will give a new strength to this mission across the country and a new pace.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the enjoyment of giving life is different.
And the revenge that he received can be called a very inspiring event in the national life of India.
Many young, small institutions, people from corporate sector, students and NGOs are going to celebrate the joy of living sales in many cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
This is aimed at bringing food and clothes together to the needy people.
It was a pleasure to see the game on the faces of those poor children.
I would like to assist those youngsters in the cities where this joy of givering is going to be celebrated.
My dear countrymen, today, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay in Pondicherry and his birth centenary year is going to begin today.
Millions of workers like me have worked to lecture the political ideology that they are working with.
He reiterated the vision of Indias rooted royalty and the ideal system that supports Indias cultural tradition.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay is being inaugurated today.
This is the principle of Sarvajan Hitay-Sabka Saksay, Antyodaya.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the interests of every person of the country.
How to reach the poorest of the poor
He presented all the economic frameworks in each hand and water to every field.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijaya Dashmi, two years ago, I started the news of Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the stakeholders for the blessings and blessings of this programme when we have completed two years.
I also express my gratitude to Akashwani because he not only spread his heart but also worked hard to reach the labourers through all regional languages.
I also express my gratitude to those ladies who had written their letters on the occasion of their hearts and made the government doors to solve the problems of the people.
Therefore, it was not just a fifteen-twenty-three-minute conversation, it was an opportunity to change the society.
There can be a greater pleasure for anyone.
How will the festival connect mankind
And that power will be the means of real power and then we all together celebrate the festival of victory.
Follow this strength, take a mantra of unity.
To take the nation to a new peak, celebrate the festival of Navaratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity and harmony, and celebrate Vijaya Dashmi.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address at Mann Ki Baat from Akashwani
My dear countrymen, the birthday of Hockey magician Dhyan Chand is on 29th August.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I salute Dhyanchand ji and for this, he also wishes to remember his contribution.
He played an important role in providing Gold medal to India in Hockey in the Olympics Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
You all know the name of Bradman.
My dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat begins to come closer, information starts coming on MyGover or Narendra Modi Pavilion.
Besides cricket, Indians also have similar awareness and awareness about other sports.
This instruction made me a source of inspiration.
Sachin says, In the heart of this time, you must talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
Girls got the medal that we got.
Our girls have shown that we are not less than anybody.
One of these girls is from North India, one from South India, one from East India and another from India.
That is why it seems as if these girls from all over the country have taken a look at brightening the name of India.
The MyGovernor Summit has written Thakur that we can do better in Olympics.
He said, Hon'ble Modi Sir, greetings for getting two medals in Rio first.
But I would like to take care of it, was it really good for us
And the answer is, no
We need to put a long distance in the field of sports.
Our parents are dependent on modern practices.
The society also believes that sports is timeless.
We cannot ignore that we cannot work according to our expectations.
Something has happened that those players who were doing good jobs in India, could not show their performances in the games and only two medals were found in the medal technologies.
One more thing is that if you don't get the medals, you will realize that for the first time, Indian sportspersons have shown some good work in many games.
Now look at this thing that his innovative Bindra ji was in the fourth position in Nambaji and got medals in a very short span of time.
The same thing happened in tennis, Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar became eligible for the final round of the trackfield.
You will be happy to see that after 36 years, the women reached the Hockey Team Olympics.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the Hockey Federation of men has been successful in reaching the Nock Out Ferries.
Our association is strong and it is a part of the dignity that Argentina who had won the Golden Jubilee, who would defeat them in the entire competition
Some of the sportspersons were good, such as Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal, Atnu Das...
My dear countrymen, we have to do a lot but whatever we have to do so far, whatever we have to do and whatever we have to do, our way will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The Committee of the Government of India will examine and practice what is being done around the world about sports.
The Committee will prepare a framework for what we can do.
We have to make visionary plans for 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I urge the state governments to establish such committees, what can we do in the field of sports, what can we do in each state, states like one or two sports and how power we can show in that game.
And I am confident that we can achieve the best possible situation in the country with a population of 65.
We have to move ahead with this resolve.
Deshbandhan, on September 5, Teachers Day
For a few years, I have been giving time to the students on the occasion of Teacher's Day and I used to spend my time being a student among them.
I used to learn too much from these students.
This was the Teacher's Day on 5th September for me and also the Education Day.
Therefore, there is a feeling in my heart that I should express my feelings about it.
The place of mother in life is also the place of teachers.
I also see such teachers who are more concerned than themselves.
They live their lives for their disciples, students.
At present, after Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopichand has a discussion.
He has presented examples of how he is sportspersons but how he is an excellent teacher.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us always takes place.
On 5th September, the birth anniversary of Majesty of India, Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan and the entire country considers this day as a Teacher Day.
Even if he reached any place in his life, he tried to live in the geography of the teacher himself.
And my own letter is very bad.
And that is why somebody's good handicrafts showed that respect increases in my mind.
If we have a photo with our teachers, a good memory, a motivating thing, then we must share...
Keep in mind that seeing the contribution of the teachers from the eyes of the students, it will be valuable for us.
Brothers and sisters, Ganesh Festival will come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a stranger and all of us feel that our country, our society, our family, every person, their lives are incomplete.
When we consider the festival of Ganesha, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of Public Ganesh Festival is to be given to the dedicated Tilaks.
The programmes should be constructed to create a new motivation, inspire the society, and the self-esteem that they have given is my birthplace and I will achieve it.
Today, not only in Maharashtra but also in the coastal areas of India, the festival of Ganesha begins.
Public issues are discussed, essay competitions and queue competitions are held.
There is a artistic way to touch social topics.
The campaign for a kind of public education is as if it continues through the Ganesh Festival, it is the inspirational mantra that Lokmanya Tilak has given us the right to self-respect.
Now we have the right to move towards Suraj, can we not give the message of this mantra to Suraj from the public Ganesh Festival
I am inviting you.
It is true that Festival is the strength of society.
Festival brings innovation in individuals and society.
Besides the festival, life is impossible but it is expected to change as long as possible.
On this occasion, I have come to know that some people, especially Ganeshotsav, Durga Puja, have written a lot and they are worried about the environment.
The idols made from the POP are not suitable to the environment.
He said that this pain has been intensified by the same way as he has demanded.
I pray to all of you to use the statue of Lord Ganesha and Mother Durga like ancient times and not follow your old tradition.
It is God's service to protect our river pond, protect our lives from pollution.
I don't know where we will take these issues from, but I don't say it alone, but it is the same thing for many.
Some believed that the idolater of Pune, Abhijit Dhondfella, the institution of Kollapur-Nisarg friend, Science Prabodhini
Eco-friendly Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
There is a lot of time for Durga Puja .
Ganesh Chaturthi greets all of you.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred on the 4th of September by the Saints.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud when Mother Teresa, who served the poor people of India, gets a saintly title.
The function will be held on 4th September, 2019 by the Government of India, under the leadership of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, there is a big change.
Manpower is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to bring people together for clean Ganga and clean Ganga with the help of five state governments.
On the 20th of this month, the village heads of the Ganga coast were invited to Allahabad.
I extend my best wishes to all the leaders who have come from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar to Jharkhand, West Bengal for this project.
I congratulate all the ministries and ministers of the Government of India who have fulfilled this vision.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a definite step in the cleanliness mission of the Ganga by bringing together the manpower.
Someone wrote from English and somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh that they should have toilets in their houses.
He urged them to build toilets.
Some children have written that if this year I don't celebrate my birthday then I will go but make toilets.
These children from seven to seven years of age have done this.
It was so impressive and emotional that the next day when we went to school, parents wrote a letter to the teachers and believed in the letter that we would build toilets in the house till a star.
Congratulations to those who made this idea and congratulated the students who tried for this and also congratulated the parents and decided to work towards making toilets in their hearts.
A sixteen-year-old daughter Mallama in this district called Satyagraha against her family.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited the village head of Mohammed Shafi.
He deposited eighty thousand rupees and made toilets within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
This is the resolve of some Indians.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, everybody has been associated with it. Everybody has some or the other contribution.
Newspapers are coming every day - what do you try
The Government of India asked people to make a film on cleanliness of two-three minutes and send this small letter to the Government of India.
I would like to tell the TV channels that we will also hold such competitions.
The ideas of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness campaign.
We are inviting me, my countrymen, we have always wanted to have relations with the neighbouring countries.
But this is not a channel of common radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are connected today with the same cultural heritage.
They will interact and deliberate on the visions and the people of Bengal will enjoy the Akashwani.
Akashwani has a great contribution in peoples contact.
The President inaugurated this channel.
Thank you for working with us for this programme.
I congratulate all the friends of the Akashwani that they are contributing even in the foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, we have delivered the Prime Minister's post smoke to me, but in the end I am a man like us.
Sometimes the emotional events touch me more.
Some such emotional events give new energy, inspiration and inspire the Indian people to do something or the other.
A 84-year-old mother-in-law is a retired teacher.
Don't declare my name, even if I have told you, I feel like telling you their names.
In a written reply, he said, We requested to release gas grants and then left the grant and then I forgot this.
But a few days back, one of our people came and gave me a letter and thanked me for giving me a gift.
This letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than Padma Shri for me.
My delegates will give a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy.
I am trying to give letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, your campaign to liberate the poor mothers from the smoke and I am a retired teacher and I will be young in a few years.
I am sending a donation of Rs. 50 thousand, which will help the poor mothers to get rid of the smoke of pulp.
We are aware that a mother who abstains from the pension of a common teacher, who provides 50 thousand rupees for the gas connection of poor mothers and not 50 thousand rupees.
These are the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, which will strengthen the faith in the future of my country.
He did not write this letter to me by the Prime Minister, but wrote a letter to Sadhasudhe.
There has been frequent flood situation in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local autonomous institutions and the social institutions have helped the citizens.
In August 2016, all the political parties, including the opposition parties, did not give any opportunity against each other, agreed together with the GST Bill.
Its credit goes to all the political parties and if all the parties start walking together then it was such a big task.
In this way, all the political parties of the country have put a voice issue in respect of what happened in Kashmir.
Those who try to create an inconvenience by making these small children more and more, they will have to answer it sometimes to the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and has been rooted in different ways.
This country has been divided into unity, the citizens, the mothers and the society, the government is the responsibility of all of us to give strength to those who sacrificed their souls and only then will the future be brighter.
I have full faith in the power of 1. 25 billion people.
Today morning, I got the opportunity to live with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports, every young man in the country will be painted with enthusiasm and hope.
We all know that in a few days, the greatest sports festival will be held in the entire world.
The name Rio is frequently in our ear.
There will be a lot of expectations, but the work of encouraging the self-confidence of those sportspersons who have gone to play in Rio is for the people of the country.
We should do something to encourage our sportspersons from wherever we are in the coming days.
The sportsperson who reaches Olympics reaches there only after hard work.
This is a kind of hard work.
Winning and losing are important, but it is more important to reach the sportsperson, and therefore, greetings and good wishes to all the sportspersons for the countrymen Rio Olympics.
Today, I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem lover - Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University, has sent a poem.
Many of us will be poets who have written poems, maybe write poems, some will do so in every language, but the poem that Surj has sent me is sharing with you.
This young man has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalam Ji.
But when Abdul Kalam ji's name comes, the words of science, technology and the Missile come in front of India's future support and therefore, Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realize the dream of Abdul Kalam ji
You are right, Ankit Ji
And if we have to go along with it or we have to move ahead then we should create research and innovation and both of these are the lifestyles of technology.
If there is no research, innovation, the way the accumulated water creates stink, the technology also becomes a burden.
If we are alive in the hope of research, innovation and innovation, then the government has taken some steps to create sweetness for sciences, research and innovation in the new generations to become innovative in this world, and therefore, let us aim to innovate.
And if I call Let us to innovate then I mean AIM.
10 lakhs will be given to those schools where such a ticketing lab will be constructed and 10 lakhs will be provided for their maintenance up to five years.
On the other hand, India is blaming many problems.
We find problems and problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find a solution based on technology.
On behalf of Atal Grand Challenges, we have called upon the youth of the country to find out, research, innovate and bring it to us through technology.
I am glad that the Government of India is looking forward to incentivizing you by giving special rewards to the research done on problems and problems, and I am happy that people are interested in it when we said about the training labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days back, I was worrying about the evil and I was enjoying the enjoyment of the rain and the news of the floods is also coming.
The state government and the central government are working very hard to help the victims.
Everyone's mind is happy despite some difficulties due to the rains, because the centre of our entire economic upheaval is the rains and the ongoing farming.
Sometimes there are such diseases that we have to face after birth .
But if we remain aware, be careful, efforts are made then the way to escape from it becomes easier.
But sometimes we are very sad in terms of work.
I urge you to keep in mind that the government, the hospital, the doctor will not enter the dengue in our homes, our departments, our families, so that there is no disease from water.
Dear countrymen, I want to take care of you for another crisis.
Today, life has become very fast, due to continuous running, we do not get time to think about ourselves and ourselves.
If the patient falls sick then he feels healed at the earliest and for this antibiotics are taken .
We don't walk through shortcut.
Complete the course of those pills.
The bacteria will be benefitted even if they leave half incomplete , even if they take more than necessary then bacteria will be benefitted , hence the course of taking pills has been decided in the days .
It is important to supply it but it is necessary to complete the course.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance , how to use antibiotics , follow their rules .
In the last decade, the maternal sudden death rate has decreased, but even today the lives of pregnant mothers are not saved in large quantities.
Decrease in the quantity of blood during pregnancy , infection during pregnancy , high blood pressure , any kind of complications can destroy their life .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign whose name is Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Maternity Abhiyan.
Through this campaign, free examination of pregnant women will be done at the Government Health Centre on 9th of every month.
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I appealed to the psychiatrists whether you cannot provide free services to poor mothers on 9th line
Cannot my doctor brothers and sisters give 12 days in a year for the poor
Thousands of doctors have written the same letter as they have worked ahead by listening to my request.
Thousands of doctors are those who believe in me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective manner in the country and the world.
The Shukracharya Niti says that there is no plant in which there is no medicinal properties.
Those who donate trees also keep them in the heavens like their own.
But even today there are some people who follow these ideals, bring in practice.
In the Republic of Mahabharata, it has been said that the trees also serve the responsibility of the child in the world.
Khandu Marti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, has done his marriage with a different inspiration.
The temples should start the tradition of planting in the rainy season.
Vegetation can easily become a mass movement.
I always tell the farmers that we damage the land due to dams on the banks of our farms, can we make wood farming instead of dams
Today, in order to build houses in India, buildings worth crores of rupees and wood have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant trees that are useful for wooden goods and households, can be cut and sold after fifteen-twenty years by the government's permission, you can get a new source of income and we can save India from doing wood imports.
The Government of India has recently agreed to a CAMPA Act to go to the States for plantation of more than Rs.
I was told that the Maharashtra government has planted two and a half crore trees in the entire state on July 1, and has resolved to plant three crore trees in the next year.
The government has created a big mass movement.
Rajasthan, Maru-Bhumi has done a big jungle festival and it has been decided to plant 25 lakh trees.
There is no small thing about five and a half million trees in Rajasthan.
Those who are not aware of the land of Rajasthan, they can know how much big width they have raised.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase the Green Sector by 50 by 2029.
The Green India Mission, which has been launched by the Central Government, has also been started by the Railways.
There is a unique tradition of Sudha Forest Festival in Gujarat .
This year, several projects like Amruvan, Ekta Van, Shahid Van have been undertaken in Gujarat and crores of trees have been launched.
I cannot mention all the states but all are eligible for commendation.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa a few days ago.
When there is a foreign tour, the international policy talks about trade, there are discussions related to security, some agreements are to be signed.
But for me the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage.
South Africa said that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and compassion fall on the ears of the world, the faces of Gandhi and Mandela come to us.
During my visit to South Africa, he visited the Finics Settlement, which is known as Mahatma Gandhis residence.
His visit will always be remembered.
Equality and equal opportunity are not such a big mantra for any society and government.
The two ways of equality and dignity lead us to a bright future.
We all hope for a good life, the good future of the children, the needs of everybody are different, the forwards are different, but the roads are the same and it is the same for development, equality, equality, equality, equality and equality.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have shown this mantra of life in South Africa from their lives.
He informed me about the incident, Prime Minister, I am speaking from Bangalore to the sculptor Varma.
Just a few days ago, I had read a letter in the newspaper that a woman succumbed to the furnace and succumbed to the lost e-mail and committed suicide.
I am sorry to be a woman.
I want to know your ideas about this.
Everyone knows that if we know about our mobile phones and e-mails, then the messages of compulsions come that you have been blessed with so much money and you have to pay so much money and take so much money.
If some people fall in love, some people are buried with greed.
These technologies are spreading across the globe.
Sometimes we are also in love.
I feel that we should be cautious of this feeling, be cautious, if such a false statement comes then we should tell our friends and friends, we should make them a little aware.
My dear countrymen, the present session of Parliament is going on. During that session, I got the opportunity to meet many people.
Our peasants bring people from your department, meet them, tell them about their problems.
But I had a pleasant experience during these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The enthusiasm of the children was worth seeing and brought a big album automatically.
The artistic pictures have been carved and painted at the station.
You must visit Aligarh and see this station.
This is an example of changing peoples participation.
Thank you and my colleagues of Aligarh for doing this kind of work in the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a season of festivals in our country along with rainy season.
Festivals will be held in temples and pilgrimages.
You are also associated with these festivals at home and outside.
Raksha Bandhan is a special significance of our hard work.
Like the last year, cannot we give our country's mothers and sisters a visit to Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
Think about this, let us meet the wife so that her life gets real protection.
Moreover, we can also confer the festival of Safety Bima Yojana or 'Jeevan Jyoti Vima Yojana' to those women who are women who make their homes clean, who are the daughters of the poor mother.
My dear countrymen, many of us are those who were born after Independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country who was born in independent India.
75 years of Hinduism and 70 years of Indias independence can inspire us, create new zeal and hope, it can be an opportunity for the country to do something.
The festival of independence is not a government programme, it should be of the people of the country.
It should be our festival like Diwali.
I hope that we will also do some good work to connect with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, I am fortunate to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort on August 15.
You will have something else in your mind, you will have to ask that thing from the Red Fort.
If you want to tell me from the Red Fort as your Prime Minister's servant then you must write it and give me some suggestions and advice.
Let me invite you, let us recall the brave sacrifices for freedom, let us remember the great men who lived for India and let us move forward with the determination to do something for the country.
Once again I got the opportunity to say Mann Ki Baat.
There is no activity for me.
I am keen to interact with you myself.
And I am glad that through the message of Mann Ki Baat to the common people of the country, from all corners of India.
I express my gratitude to the Akashwani for the successful efforts made by the Akashwani to broadcast translation between the regional languages of Mann Ki Baat at 8.
And I am glad that the people who listen to the news programmes of my heart, after the programme, they reach me through the telephone channel and through My Gov.
I am very useful to run the government on the suggested issues we have sent.
How active should the government be for public welfare
How much priority should be given to the welfare of the people
For this, my interaction with you is very important.
5th June is the World Environment Day.
There are discussions on environment and concerns around the world.
The main concept of Environment Day is the ero Tolerance for Elligible Wildlife Trade.
The reason for this is that we must have seen that there was a recent drought in the forests near the Himalayan plains of Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu Kashmir.
Therefore, saving the forests, saving water becomes the responsibility of all of us.
About two-and-a-half hours have been discussed with the Chief Ministers of every state.
He had heard what he wanted to say.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have used technology in abundance.
We have to reach other states of the country through the NITI Aayog through these successful measures taken by the State Governments.
Peoples participation is the main cause of success in solving such problems.
Therefore, water storage is equally important.
And that is why drop-more crop-- every drop--------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a matter of great pleasure that in many states the farmers are now using smoke irrigation and micro irrigation and some are using Tushar irrigation.
I also learned from them that there are major objectives in front of many states, particularly Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Their efforts are that every year, two-two, three-three lakh hectares of land has been brought under the micro irrigation.
If this scheme is implemented in all the states, it will not only benefit the farmers but also increase the storage of water.
Our brother-in-law Mission Bhagirathi in Telangana has tried to use the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers well.
Efforts are being made to refresh ground water with the help of technology through NITI Aayog in Andhra Pradesh.
In Maharashtra, people are providing financial assistance along with hard work.
I am sure this movement will be useful in saving Maharashtra from the future water crisis.
The state of Chhattisgarh has taken up a democratic-popular mission.
A big campaign has been taken to revive those giants who are in the ancient times of Rajasthan and Gujarat as water temples.
But in some parts of that state there is water stagnation.
There is a big work being done by constructing checkhams and small dams.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is plenty of water therefore we should be careless and if we are troubled by the end of monsoon then how will it go
And water is not just limited to farmers.
This is a matter related to the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the rural and the rural people.
Therefore, when the monsoon is coming, water should be our priority and when we celebrate Diwali, how much water should we save in the rainy season
We can see that our joy will increase many times.
And this is not just the government but also the political leader but the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to create modern India.
Our India is transparent.
Those who have been transported from one end to the other end of India.
We have to change our old habits to do so.
Today, I want to touch a topic about which we help me, we can successfully move towards that direction.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards cashless society, which is a robbery-free system.
We can get the money through electronic technology and send the money.
There is no fear of going to your pocket chories.
It will be registered automatically.
It will be difficult to use this method in the beginning but once it becomes habitual, this system will be easier.
This is possible because in the last few days, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been implemented in which bank accounts of almost all the families of the country have been opened.
On the other hand, Aadhaar number has also been received and mobile phones have now come under almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhaar-Mobile-Jam.
By synergizing them we can move towards a robbery system and cashless society.
We must have seen that the RuPay card has been given with Jan Dhan accounts.
In the coming days, it will be useful for both card credit and debits.
And a small instrument has also been made available for drinking water.
Oh.
Through this machine, you can give the money to others using Aadhaar number and RuPay card.
One of the initiatives taken by the Government of India is how to pay through POS
The second initiative has been taken by the bank on mobile.
It will be easier for your mobile phone to exchange money.
In a way, the bank has taken this step towards our beard.
Activities are underway to provide bank services to the post office as well.
If we learn to use this system in practice, we make it a habit then there will be no need for direct transactions and no need to take money.
Behaviour will continue automatically and transparent.
Behaviour and behavior of two numbers will be closed.
The result of black money will also be reduced.
Therefore, I would urge the countrymen to start it.
We can see that once this system has started, we can move forward in a simple way.
Whether someone had thought twenty years ago from today or not so much mobile phone would have been in our hands.
It is not possible to live without it gradually.
It is possible that the cashless system will be gradually shaped.
But it will be better if it comes to light in a short period.
We should encourage our sportspersons participating in Rio Olympics to increase their self-confidence.
He was the Chief Minister.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India.
Whether they get nutritious food according to the need or not .
Whether he should be a trainee for his physical fitness .
I am glad to see that even if the sportsperson is going to be a sportsperson, it is likely to be a new responsibility as the chief minister, in such an environment that my colleague is so aware of his work as a sports minister.
When our sportspersons feel that the 1. 25 billion countrymen are standing with us, it is a great strength and reflects their self-confidence.
Last time I had taken up the topic of FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup.
I have received information from all over the country and at this time I can see that the atmosphere of football has started to grow throughout the country.
Several initiatives are being taken by your team.
I have received several information about the Narendra Modi Power.
It is possible that many of them would not be playing, but it was a pleasant experience for me that thousands of thousands of young people in the country were enjoying the sports.
We are familiar with the relationship between Cricket and India, but I have seen that so much interest in football
One should not count every aspect of victory and defeat.
With a sportsmanship, India has created its identity in the world.
I appeal to the people of the country to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm for our sports sector.
Since last eight to ten days, there has been no new financing from anywhere.
I am not talking about the select summits, I talk about those students who have done neutral exercises throughout the year.
It is now clear that the tenth-eleventh nickname has started coming together and our daughter is singing the pledges.
It's a pleasure.
We have to move forward with confidence.
But I have come up with a new kind of questions and I have never thought of it.
I was very shocked to read this.
He said that when I went home after getting 89. 33 per cent mark, I thought that I would be fond of all around, I would be congratulating, but even if the household had said that he had got four times more than 90 per cent.
But my heart feels stiffened.
I feel that this pain can not be of your own soul but of millions and millions of students like you.
Because the atmosphere has become such that what has been found is more error than enjoying it.
This is the second form of negative attitude.
I would like to invite the people and parents of the neighbourhood to adopt the famine that your children will bring.
Anyway, one day will come that you will get 100 percent of the benefits and even then anyone will say that you have achieved 100 percent of the benefits, but if you have done immovable, it would have been better.
Therefore, it is necessary for each thing to have a limitation.
Goswami, the satisfaction of Jodhpur, has written a letter of similar meaning.
He said that people close to him are not ready to accept their duties.
They say that they have been doing something better, they have been doing something better.
I would like to tell you that in such a situation you will not let yourself balance yourself.
Everyone expresses his hopes and listen.
Keep yourself firm on your decisions and keep trying to do something better.
But if we don't believe in the solutions that have been achieved then we can never build a new architecture.
And therefore, I would like to assert that the song of success that has been achieved.
Those who don't get good quality in the field of sports, move ahead in the field of music, move ahead in the field of art and business.
God has given some skills to everyone.
Buses, you know your inner strength, emphasize on it, you will progress in your life.
There was a time when Santur Wad was an integral part of the folk singing of Kashmir Valley.
But Pandit Shivkumar, who handled this drum and today he became an important drum in the world music sector.
The SANE-Indian musical instrument was limited to the SANE.
During the period of kings and kings there was a place of honor near the entrance of Darbar .
However, Ustad Bisimilla Khan took this pledge in his hands and laid the foundation stone for a good pledge in the world at this height.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I realize that the expenditure incurred on medicines in the poor families of our country proves to be a result of the sliding of that family.
And it is true that the cost of not falling sick is very low, but after getting sick, the health becomes like before.
We cannot afford that our lifestyle is not a disease, we cannot solve the disease and we cannot have a financial burden on the families.
One thing is that keeping cleanliness is the most important way to stay away from the disease is the base.
If anyone can serve the poorest of the poor then it is cleanliness.
And the second thing is that for which I consistently insist on Yoga.
Some people call it Yoga.
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
There is an attraction for Yoga all over the world, faith and the world has adopted it.
This is an invaluable gift given by our ancestors to the world.
The stressful world gets the strength of living a balanced life with yoga .
It is easier for those associated with Yoga to be healthy, balanced, to create a strong will power in mind, to concentrate in every work.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes a collective environment can transform the lives of the person.
I hope that on 21st June we will definitely do something about this.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we use this day on 21st June for yoga in our lives
Can you do yoga science in our social life
My request is that we should not remain behind.
It is extremely important for India to be healthy.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with you through Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I had given you a mobile number and we could hear the news of Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on it.
But now it has been made easier.
And whenever you will be able to hear the word Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on this number.
Namaste.
We decide to do many things during the holidays.
During these holidays, the season is like that of Ambassador, it feels like enjoying Ambassador.
But this time, heat has enjoyed this joy all around.
It is natural to have an atmosphere of concern throughout the country.
And even when there is a continuous misery then the water storage stops.
Sometimes, due to encroachment, sometimes due to shrinking of roads, due to obstacles in the water supply, water storage is less than capacity in the reservoir.
And due to this happening every year, water storage capacity decreases.
However, I have seen that citizens also make very good efforts for this.
In many villages, there is awareness about this and the real value of water is those who have faced the crisis of humidity.
And there is sensitivity for water conservation and there is also the ability to do something about it.
Just a few days back, I was told that the Hivere Bazar Gram Panchayat in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers of that region have played a very sensitive role in water.
He decided not to liquidate those people who have more water, such as bananas or bananas.
It looks very simple to hear this, but it is not so easy.
Have you all made such a big decision together
He spoke about Tushar Synchronization, Thibak Synchronization, Water Conservation and Water Supply.
Besides, I am telling you about this small village of Hiverebazar, but I congratulate all such villages and their best efforts.
He built nearly seventy-seven farmers.
As a result, ground water level has increased and water level has increased.
He said that when the water was needed, the water was found and the statistics were highlighted.
The income from farming increased by twenty percent.
Besides water consumption, water quality improves due to increase in water level.
But many such initiatives are implemented by the people, which never come out.
If the government has launched a good mission then sometimes it gets fame but if we look around us then it will be remembered how people try to get rid of this problem through innovative solutions to overcome the evil.
It is human nature that if you know any good thing, the feeling that all the problems have been solved in your mind.
There will be 106 to 110 per cent rains in the rainy season, and this news showed all over the world as if they had a peace message.
It's a long time to get the rain but it's a good rain that brought the brightness.
Can we take any initiative to save water from the village
The farmers need soil and it proves useful for the crops.
And if we throw the garbage in the rural areas then it will be beneficial for agriculture, and the capacity to accumulate water in the bottom will also increase.
There will be water in our walls.
Today, there is a crisis of water, there is a situation of misery but the next month and the next month is in our hands.
Their concerns are social because this work has been going on for nearly thirty years.
Several governments have come and several schemes have been taken out and a lot of money has been spent.
Ganga gives us blessings, Ganga gives us employment and we get a new strength to live by the Ganges.
As the Ganges flows, it gives a new momentum to the economic activities of the country.
A Bhagirathi brought us to the Ganges but today millions of Bhagirathis need to save them.
This mission will never succeed without participation of people.
There are several efforts in this regard at the government level.
Efforts are being made to get support from the states of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to participate in social and voluntary organisations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of the Ganges clean and to prevent industrial pollution in the water of the Ganges.
In the utensils of the Ganges, the drainage flows in large quantities every day.
Trash skimmers are helped in cleaning the waste on water in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna.
It has been made available to all the local administration agencies and they have been asked to clean the waste using it.
And recently I was told that where efforts are being made well, three tons of garbage is removed every day.
That is, it is true that such a large amount of dirt has stopped from growing.
In the coming days, there has been a plan to set up a trash skimmer at some places and people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna will be experienced soon.
A workshop has been organised with paper-level industries, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar factories to curb industrial pollution.
I still feel that it will have good results.
The forgetting of the drains from the paper factories is now almost on the path of closure.
This is the symptom that we are moving towards the right direction and in a way awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that not only will I live in the bottom of the Ganges but when a person from far-flung southern part meets me, he definitely says that the Ganga will not be cleaned.
This is the belief of the common people that will achieve the success of the Ganga Swachhta Mission.
The citizens are giving donations in cleaning the Ganges.
This work is going on in a better way.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayat Raj Diwas in India.
On this very date, the Panchayat Raj system was started in our country.
And slowly, the Panchayat Raj system, spread across the country, is working successfully as an important component of our democratic governance system.
I am glad that on 14th April, Dr. Ambedkar ji Jayanti had got the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mahu.
Today, on 24th dawn, I will celebrate the Panchayat Raj Diwas in the state where most of our tribal brothers and sisters live in Jharkhand.
And at three o'clock in the afternoon, we interacted with all Panchayats across the country.
These campaigns have done a great job of creating awareness.
How can democratic institutions be empowered at the rural level at the corners of India
How will the village be self-reliant
In some villages, foodgrains were taken up.
The awareness that has come from the villages is the sustainability of Indo-Udaya.
The base of Indo-UDA is Gram Uday.
Therefore, if we emphasize on rural development then we will not be able to achieve the desired results.
Shermila Gharpure from Mumbai called on her and expressed her heartiest concern.
I am talking to Sharmila Gharpura from Mumbai.
I have a question about school and college education.
There has been a need for reforms in the education sector for the last several years.
absence of proper school or college or quality of education .
Even after completing his education, he does not know many important things, so that his children remain behind in the world.
What are your ideas about this
Today, the biggest dream of parents in every family is education of children.
And I believe that the results of those families who have the sense of awareness are seen on the school.
Every government in our country has emphasized the issue of education and every government has made efforts for it in its own way.
However, more important is the improvement of our education system than the expansion.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Textiles education from the Literacy Mission should now be our priority.
Now it is worth noting that the records have been counted today.
How many children have come to school, they have been seen earlier today.
We have to concentrate on those children who have come to school for better education and proper education.
We must have seen in this government's budget, efforts have been made to emphasize the need for better education.
In this budget, we will see that 10 government universities and 10 private universities have been freed from government control and come to an environmental and competing level.
Would you like to work for best universities, best universities
The scheme has been implemented to provide them with full freedom.
At the same time, the more important is education.
Over the past few days, people have been thinking about a problem.
He writes on the Web Portal MyGov, some of my Narendra Modi writes on Twitter, and many youngsters are writing in it.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, Namaskar, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karnwal.
The sports sector is also very important for the youth of today.
They should be constituent and should be a good leadership, so that they can also develop inclusive development.
I would like to encourage more and more young people and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guides.
One day I got to know that before talking to you, talk to all these councils.
And when I thought that this kind of meeting was held earlier, he replied that this is the first such meeting since the independence of the country.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those young friends who have led me in the context of all these things.
There is a lot of work at your level but if our organisations work in a collective form, then how much can it be achieved
Now it is true that I am the national chapter cadet of the NCC.
I am very happy to note that I am a young man and I believe that such organizations should have a new sense of consciousness.
I asked for some issues in this meeting.
Many things have been spoken to him.
We have several young organisations, how can we bring innovations in their programmes
If we write this on my Narendra Modi Pavilion, then I will reach the right place and I feel that after this meeting, all these things will get a boost.
I believe that it will come into our minds and it will be possible to integrate itself with all this.
My dear countrymen, I have to tell you one thing that you all will participate in the discussion.
I believe that this is a matter of awakening all of us.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that during the last several elections, how many parties would give gas cylinders
And every political party liked that if it is to be touched by the middle class, then gas cylinder is a very important topic.
This is a public experience.
But it was never thought of going out of this square.
Today, my countrymen, I am happy to seek my best wishes to you.
I chose a different path and that was the path to trust the people.
Sometimes we have to rely more on our people than the political leaders.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
In our country, grants have not been denied during such an equation of rights.
I would especially request all the political classes today that we should do at least one thing to believe in everywhere and everywhere.
We will get the result of which we have never thought.
We have to go in this direction.
And I always feel as if I had come to my mind to take a second and fourth class job
Believe those who have received tests and qualities.
Sometimes I feel that we should declare that there is no ticket penetration on this one line of the railway.
This cannot be a government rule but can create an atmosphere of trust.
And this environment is not a political leader, it has been created by one crore families of the country.
Every braking news is painful on every newspaper and news channel.
Is it not a good thing happening around us in this country that has a hundred and a half million people
Please change the situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his deep condolences, but I feel that this anger is not over me but over the situation.
You must remember, our dignitaries, Dr.
I have seen that some television channels make positive statements a specific time.
There is a positive atmosphere in today's era.
Everyone feels that good news is available to the people.
It is true that when the biggest person, the best thing, the best words, the best words and the best words are spoken, then the more the results are the best results of positive news.
It is true that if we emphasize more on goodness then there will not be much space for bad things.
If you drink the lamp then the darkness will be removed and it will happen.
And that is why we can be convinced that the web site government has started the name Transforming India.
Not only the government but also the people are well-beinged.
And this is a portal on which we can send good news to ourselves.
You can contribute.
Ravi ji, you have asked for good news but please don't ask me.
The Kumbh Mela is a special feature of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be a center of attraction for tourism .
The people of the world knew that millions of people come to the river bank for so long.
It is celebrated in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
In view of this event, people are creating new parameters in terms of programme management.
For the last two days, I have been watching that many people are uploading the pictures of the Kumbh.
I am confident that the tourism department of the Government of India will take the competition of such photographs and appeal to the people to upload the best photographs.
Not only should it be cleanliness, but people returning from there will take the message of cleanliness.
I am confident that this Kumbh is a religious, spiritual festival but we can transform it into a social festival.
As usual, I am glad that once again many thanks have been associated with my hearts.
Mann Ki Baat is always awaiting me and you too.
At this time I have seen, many letters, reactions, phones have come, many things, there are information, inspirations - everybody sees something or the other. And there is a feeling that I have to include, but I have the limitations of time, that cannot even include everyone.
However, I would like to share this thing with you once again in the dust of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have remembered that in the last few years, we had discussed some of the books of Premchand ji and some of the books that we read were determined to share with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me to talk about some other books.
But I should like to assure you that I cannot give a lot of time to save the book.
But only one advantage is that I get the opportunity to know about the topics of several books from what you write and send.
But I feel that we have to take this initiative forward from the experience of the last one month.
We will build a corner of the books on the Narendra Modi App and when we read a new book, we will write and discuss it and you can also suggest a good name for these books.
And I am feeling that today the Indians have lost their minds on the subject of water.
There are several effective efforts across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about the traditional methods.
Through the medium, several innovative initiatives have been launched on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or NGOs, they are doing something or the other on the battlefield.
The rural people have worked hard to provide a definite direction to a stream flowing from the mountain.
And that too is a pure indigenous method.
This has not only prevented the loss of soil dust and pieces, but also the farmers have started getting water.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful states of the North-East are the first states in the country to create your water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, those crops which are costing less water are being encouraged and farmers are not harmed.
Several fairs are held on the occasion of festivals.
Do not use these fairs for water conservation
Every layer of the society is going on in the fairs.
In these fairs, we can give the message of water conservation a very effective trend, exhibitions, nook and dance, with festivals, we can deliver the message of water conservation in a very simple way.
In fact, this month, World Children's Winners Sports Competition was organised in Moscow.
This is a sportsperson in which young people who have been rescued from cancer, those who have come out of their lives fighting cancer.
The event was organised in the event, including nembaji, intellectuals, climate change, running, football and table tennis.
All these ten winners of our country won medals in this competition.
Some of these players have won more than one medal.
Sanjay Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Dada of Kolkata, P.
Many of Aurobindo Rao, many people from different parts of the country have written me on the Narendra Modi App and My Gave and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in my heart.
In fact, the year 2019 has been very crucial for India in terms of space progress.
Our scientists had left the ASAT space in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
However, there was not much discussion on the big and important events like A-SAT during the election.
With the help of ASAT sector, we have achieved the capacity to set up satellites at a distance of 300 kilometers in just three minutes.
India, which has achieved success, has become the fourth country in the world and will be proud of how the entire country has moved from Chandrayaan-2 to Sriharikota on 22nd July.
The photographs of Chandrayaan-2 filled the country with joy and joy.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is unique in many ways.
Chandrayaan-2 will further clarify our understanding of the moon.
With this, we can get more detailed information about the moon, but if you will consider me what two big things have been learned from Chandrayaan-2, then I will say, these two things are Feath and Firelessness.
We should have faith in our talent and capabilities and trust our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to hear that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
He is Indian in both heart and spirit.
There is a mission of the entire indigenous system.
When there was talk of innovative enthusiasm in the new areas, our scientists are the best, the world class.
Another important faction is that there is no need to panic any crisis.
The way our scientists have left all the technological questions in the space of Chandrayaan-2, in the record time, by day and night.
This great penance of scientists has been observed throughout the world.
Many people are surprising that the time has not changed even when it comes to reaching Chandrayaan.
We have to face temporarily difficulties in our lives, but always remember that we have the power to overcome it.
I am confident that Chandrayaan-2 Mohammad will inspire the youth of the country to innovate science and innovation.
Finally, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting for the September session, when lander-wicks and rover-procedures will come down on the surface of the moon.
Today, through the message of Mann Ki Baat, I invite the students of the country, the youth and the youth of the country to know about a very entertaining event - a quiz competition.
I would like to appeal to young friends and students to participate in this uiz Committee and to make our participation, competition more entertaining and unforgettable.
I urge the school, the parents, the enthusiastic chiefs and the teachers to take a lot of effort to win their school.
The most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the most qualified students from every state to their own expenses to Sriharikota and in September, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when the moon lands on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event for these victorious students, but you will have to participate in the uiz Competition, you will have to achieve maximum qualities and you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have done a survey.
Our mind has accelerated the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and has always inspired the efforts made for cleanliness.
The journey that started five years ago today is creating new standards of cleanliness with the participation of many.
We have achieved an ideal position in the matter of cleanliness, not only the root cause but the way the achievements that have been achieved in the matter of cleanliness from the villages to the public places are the strength of the determination of a hundred and thirty crore people, but we will not stop coming here.
This campaign has now moved ahead from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is the engineer and has left his job in the US and returned to India to serve Mother India.
A few days ago, he tried to make Delhi not only clean but also beautiful.
He started with his team from the garbage kundas of Lodhi Garden.
Through Street Art, beautiful paintings are decorated to many parts of Delhi.
When they started showing their arts from the walls of Overbridge and Schools to the huts, people got the support and in a way the silosilos started.
You would remember that during the Kumbh festival, the paintings of Prayagraj were decorated on the road.
I realized that Yogesh Saini and his teams also played a very important role in this.
Even though the sound of colors and silk does not come, but the message that is produced by the paintings made from them proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making wealth from waste to wealth in our society.
If you want to say one way, we have moved towards making a gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had read a very entertaining response on MyGov.
This was the reaction of Brother Mahmood Aslam, who lived in Shapia, Jammu Kashmir.
He writes, "Mann Ki Baat" is very good to hear the programme.
I am happy to say that I played an active role in the Community Mobility Mobility programme- Bank to Village event in my state, Jammu and Kashmir.
There should also be arrangements for online monitoring of the program.
My belief is that this was the first such event in which people had directly interacted with the government.
Brother Mahmoud Aslam Ji sent this message to me and I realized that when I got to know about the bank-to-village programme, I would like to know that the whole country should be aware of it.
This programme will imagine how enthusiastic and encouraging the people of Kashmir to connect with the mainstream of development.
Several issues such as literacy, gender quality, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, pollution education, senior citizens have been discussed.
Friends, The programme was not just a government formality but the officials returned to the village throughout the day, but this time the officers had also stayed in the Panchayat for two days and they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
Under Khelo India, sportspersons were kept for children.
Literature, MNREGA job cards and Scheduled Tribe certificates were also found there.
The people of Kashmir participated in this festival of development.
It is a matter of great pleasure that the Bangkok to Village programme was organised in remote areas where government officials had to go to the remote roads and climb the mountains and make a one-and-a-half-day pedestrian.
The officers also went to the Panchayats across the border, where there was constant fear of plague from the border, not only that, the officers also went to the most sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Welcome to the village was so heavy that more than two days stayed in the village.
It is very pleasant that a large number of people participate in these areas and plan plans for us.
It is also obvious that people are seeing grievances in the path of development, they are constantly walking and they can never succeed in their knees.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra, honoured by the Gyanpeeth Awards, has presented the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he said, Hodige Madige Agyed Langna. The land magna.
Throughout India, Alg Alg Cultural and Speakers celebrate their traditions, the month of Shravan.
Whenever we look around in this season, it seems as if the earth has made a shawl of greenery.
A new energy is transmitted everywhere.
In this sacred month, many devotees visit Kawad and Amarnath Yatra, while some people fast regularly and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagpanchami.
During this period, Rakhi Purnima is also a symbol of brother-in-law's love.
If the discussions of the month of Shravan are going on then you will be happy to hear that this time, the most emotional participants have participated in the Amarnath Yatra for the last four years.
Since one July till now more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave .
The more emotional participants have participated in the journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, the more emotional participants have participated in this event in just 28 days.
I also congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Those who come back from the journey, they bow down to the feelings of love and affection of the people of the state.
These things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham since the start of the Chardham Yatra this year in Uttarakhand.
After the severe calamities in 2013, such a number of pilgrims have reached there for the first time.
I urge all of you to visit areas where natural beauty was seen during the monsoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage are not more teachers.
I extend my best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and juicy month of Shravan will create a transformation of new energy, new hopes and new hopes.
Similarly, in the month of August, India recalls the uit India Movement.
I want to make some special preparations for the 15th of August and find a new way to celebrate this festival of Independence.
When we see the television, we see a single pavement of rains from all sides - Pur, Sachelle water, transport corner, other paintings, our farmers, birds, flowing waterfalls, green streams, we will have to come out with our families.
Rainfall, freshness and joy bring both the French and the Hepatis.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stay, where to stay, there is a lot of hard work but there is a limit of time.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on this occasion.
My young friends, we are busy in the examination.
Today, we are often looking forward to the collaboration between India and Australia.
India has confronted Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The time has come to create a new revolution in this sports world.
And we see that nutritious climate is also being created in India for football, hockey, tennis and kabaddi.
Perhaps you might have noticed that India has the rank of FIFA World Football Competition in the next year 2017.
24 associations from all over the world are going to play in India.
On the other hand, I see that the attraction of football has increased in the youth, whether it is EPL or Spanish Ling or Indian Superlig.
Young friends take time to see them on the television.
How will the competition be held between government, educational institutions and social organizations to connect themselves with the game
We see that all this happened in the case of cricket.
But this is the environment that we have to prepare for other sports.
This is a golden occasion to identify India.
My dear students, we must have decided to visit tourism during these holidays.
And I also remember that the work we did not accumulate to our tourism department, our cultural department was not possible, which the state governments could not do and the government of India could not do, it was done by millions of tourists in the country.
India is filled with diversity.
Perhaps there is no district in India where I didn't go.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Coal India.
And I am happy that nearly 10 thousand people have visited the coal mine near Nagpur as a tourist.
Some efforts are being made by both tourists and tourists living in tourist places.
All efforts are not just a system of scientific method but it is also happening.
Do we also pay special attention to this
My young friend will help me in this work.
Overall employment generation is possible through tourism sector.
India is far behind in comparison to world tourism .
But if we decide to emphasize the tourism sector, we can attract the world towards India.
By attracting huge interests from the tourism sector across the globe to our country, millions of youth of our country can create employment opportunities.
Whether it is government or institution or society or citizens, we all have to work together.
Let us try to do this.
My young friends, the stalls have come and I don't seem to be fit for the past.
If you cannot swim, you can decide to learn to swim in these beds.
If the cycle cannot be run, then the cycle cannot be used in these sockets.
Even today while typing on the computer I do with two fingers , should not I learn to do clean typing
There are many skills for our personality development.
It will increase so much that after the school starts after the holidays, when the college starts, you will go back and tell your friend that in this holiday, I have learnt this.
My time was spent, you just learned a new one.
Friends, There will be a mutual discussion on this.
There have been several information on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji.
During the last drive of summer we had told that stains also suffer from heat hence keep a vessel of water filled in your balcony or glass for smells .
I have done the same thing and I am happy to say that this has only made my friendship with Chimanyas.
He called me and reminded me of a chain of work.
Last time I remembered and I had told you that during summer, you should fill the water in the mud utensils for the birds.
He told me that he has done this for the entire year and has been friendly with many strangers.
He loved the great poet Mahadevi Varma, the great poet of Hindi literature.
He had written in his poem. I will not let you go away, I will fill the courtyard with the donors and I will fill the house with sweets and sweets.
We can also do the same thing that Mahadeva ji said.
I congratulate and express my gratitude to you for bringing in mind a very important issue.
Have we ever given water to them during summers
I express my gratitude to you all for your sensitivity in a very simple way.
However, this is a habit in India.
But I express my sincere gratitude to the craftsmen for this thing.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, we must have heard that digital India-Digital India.
Some people feel that digital India is just a world of young people in the city.
But it is not like that.
You will be happy to hear that a farmer facility has been built for your service.
If we download the farming facility in our mobile phones then it will help us know a lot about farming and climate.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I hope that they will download their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for others, the summer is the holiday but the summer is the time for the farmers to sweat.
He waits for the rain.
The time before the direct season of farming begins is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think of what will happen to us by water.
The ponds, water flowing drains, water coming in the ponds, where some garbage has been stored or some encroachment has taken place, water coming off and resulting in water losses.
First of all, if we save water in the rainy season, we fill the ponds, we fill the river drains then even if we don't get rainy season then we will lose our loss.
We must have seen that we have decided to build 5 lakh farms.
Through Manrega, emphasis has been laid to create water resources for water storage.
There will be so many villages across the country, there will be many progressive farmers, there will be many aware people who have done this work.
But still there is a need to work more today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, today I will repeat one thing to you and the Government of India has recently organized a grand demonstration on agriculture.
I saw how modern technology has been harvested.
But there is still a need to reach the farm.
We need to reduce the use of fertilizer and now we have also become farmers.
We have to practice this mantra and use the scientific methods and look forward to our agriculture sector.
I am hopeful that we will complete the required work that we have to do in one or two months to save water.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
The victory over diabetes is a declaration of World Health Day.
It is said that in 2014, there was an institution of diabetes patients in India up to 1.
3 of deaths have been reported to be due to diabetes.
The whole world is worried about diabetes, so victory over diabetes on World Health Day has been decided on April 7.
We all know that our lifestyle type . is the main cause of diabetes .
If you like yogasana then do yogasanas.
Otherwise do exercise to run at least .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We are sometimes hesitant to look after health.
And when the health is very bad then it is known that diabetes has shrunk in our body a long time ago.
It means that this is such a disease which is possible to get quickly checked up .
My dear countrymen, we have a lot of work about this.
I would like to ask you whether it is TB or diabetes.
And therefore, I invite all the countrymen to get rid of tuberculosis to overcome diabetes.
Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary, especially on 14th April.
His 150th birth anniversary was celebrated across the country.
A five-Tirth-Mahu is his birthplace.
Where he took up higher education in London, Nagpur where he took initiation.
I am extremely fortunate to visit Mahu at the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become a better citizen.
By conducting the path shown by them, we can pay great tributes to them by becoming a better citizen.
In the last few days, Vikram Sawantsar will start and new Vikram Sawantsar will come.
They are celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can hear your mobile phone.
Just give us a missed call.
We should make a Missed Collection, according to your facilities.
If you want to listen to the previous programme of Mann Ki Baat then you can hear it in your language.

Let us also participate in this.
He sent photographs of some such sites and made photos uploaded that they were really happy to see them.
If you want to see something by walking through your eyes, then you can create a vision of seeing it before.
There should be a desire to reach where no one has ever gone before.
Western Col Fields Ltd. , Savaner place near Nagpur , where there are mines of coal .
When people go to tourist places then they buy something or the other.
If he is poor then he will spend more.
I ask you a question for consideration.
Can we collect new arts and skills in these beds to achieve something new in our personality
Why should not you increase your strength
Do you like to paint but do not you come
Hey, let's start.
In order to develop personality, to learn new arts, to increase skills, use the holidays.
There are countless areas.
Shilpa Kuke of Mysore has brought a sensitive issue to all of us.
If you ask a question then they answer it and tell you.
And once you see what is your usefulness in it
And yet, if you want to get a brilliance, then we will complain to me about it.
Save water in villages or villages.
How can not save the drops of water in the coming monsoon
How will the water in the village stay in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have sickened our mother because of the use of hyper rays of fertilizers.
But if you use excellent spices, would you like to eat food
The same food will not like it.
But today we have become inadequate in terms of TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to the news of my heart through radio.
The ideas of the examination will start in your mind.
I also want to join you in your journey.
I feel as much as you look at the tests of your children.
But if we change our perspective of looking at the exam then we can be anxious.
In the backdrop of my heart, I had told you that your experience, your information should be sent to the Narendra Modi Pavilion.
I am glad that the teachers and students who have achieved great success in their lives, the learners of the society have written several things and sent them to me.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, students and teachers from the news programme.
I will tell you something about what I have heard and what I have read and what I have been told.
But I am confident that my 25-30-minute interaction will be useful for those students who are going to meet the exam.
My dear Student Friends, if I start my conversation with you, the story of today's mind, by a well-known Opinion of the world, what will be useful for them while carrying out the summits of success in life
Their experiences will definitely be useful to you.
I am aware that in a few days the exams will start.
Some of you may have been under stress.
I have only one message.
You will keep your mother-in-law from you, keep your teachers and other members from your family, keep your friends.
If you go anywhere then how will your preparation be started
How many percent qualities will you get
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
During the last 24 years, several difficult moments have come and many good moments have also come.
But it was always more than the people and it grew as long as it continued to grow.
And for that I needed to find a solution.
Then I thought that I kept myself expecting and setting up my own goal.
My focus was on the chendu and then all the goals were achieved from us.
Friends, what were you saying
Don't bury your expectations.
You have to make your future.
Should you spend your time in competition with others
You will see that no one can stop you from going ahead and you will not need to depend on someone else to enjoy the success you have achieved before.
You will feel self-confidence.
Friends, Do not consider the game of tests or quality.
Where did we reach, how much did we get
Don't stand in this direction.
It is known from these tests whether our attitude is correct or not it is known from these tests.
And therefore, if your dreams are huge, then the festival of joy will be yourself.
And that is why what will happen this year
Do not keep yourself limited .
Keep moving ahead with a great goal in front of the team and even if it gets less success than that, it will not be disappointed, it will be inspired to work harder and more powerfully.
Thousands of citizens have written small issues from my power and mobile phones.
However, for the entire year, 365 days, our daily routine, our dreams and imaginations have to be favourable.
Shriman Prabhakar Reddy said that I had a problem in Mandle, and he was insisting on sleeping at the right time and waking up early in the morning and enlightening the practice.
Prabhakar Reddy said that along with the entrance and other necessary things, it should be reached at the examination centre on time.
I cannot say this because I am not serious about sleep.
And many of my friends complain that I don't take enough sleep.
During the period of examination, I talk about sleeping to give you an exam in a stress-free state.
You won't do that
I don't want to do it.
Being afflicted with life is an important reason for the success.
Not only this, the daily routine also worsens.
And therefore don't understand anything small, rabbits.
Decision, please.
The negative impact of the stress that is under these tensions falls on their famine.
And whatever practice I have done, I will leave any question paper on the basis of my self-confidence, whatever question papers come, they will leave it with determination.
Let us know the path of achieving success by giving a bright blessing to this test.
Namaskar me Viswanathan Anand.
Let me begin with good wishes for the exams.
I would like to tell you how to go for my exams and my experience about it.
I am aware that the tests are similar to the problems that are coming after you.
You should rest properly , you should take peaceful sleep at night , you should eat all over your belly , you should not be hungry and the most important thing is that you should stay quiet .
All this is similar to the left of the wise.
When you play, you don't know what thirst is coming out, in the same way, you don't even know what questions are going on in the examination
Therefore if you stay calm and you have eaten all over your belly , you will feel that your brain will remember the right answer at the right time .
That's why it's quiet.
Do not give more stress on yourself , do not expect much .
This is important, look at it as a challenge. Whether I want to ask what I have taught me in the year, can I answer this question
Reflect the most important thing in the last minute. Remember what you don't remember, while examining, you might remember some of the topics with teachers or students, and this will help you to remember a lot about the topic.
If you raise the question of difficulty, then you will realize that it is new questions for you and then when you give an exam then you can get rid of it better.
So stay quiet and sleep good at night, do not show too much self-confidence but do not remain disappointed at the same time.
I have always seen that you were afraid that these tests would be better than that.
And while playing an international intelligent game, you must have seen them how they sit still.
It is true that it is difficult to say so, but efforts should be made.
If you don't talk to friends, go alone, you will be like a commendable guy, you will not be calm until the last minute.
If the water is calm then things are also seen in deep but if the surface of the water is dissolved then nothing is seen below .
At that time one feels the tension inside .
Then I feel that if you take a little rest then you will feel better.
For that I have developed a system myself.
I breathe deeply and breathe deeply, three times and five times deeply.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds, but after doing so, my heart was calm and my mind was ready to understand the topic.
My experience will also be useful for you.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
Whatever my power writes, at least half a day, we have to spend time with our friends and families in joy.
And what do you do
Friends, do not do this.
If you have ever visited any place along with your parents then remember that moment, get out of it and give it for at least half an hour.
It is like this that Rajat ji should understand the said issue.
Friends, what will I tell you about "Peace"
Today, before you have been tested, a person has sent a message to you who are originally a teacher and has become an educator.
Ramcharit Manas is trying to connect this great scripture with the present times and touch this scripture across the country and around the world.

Friends, Today I want to tell you one more thing.
G.
However, it is a matter of pride that Yoga Sadhan is a Gurukillai in the journey to develop the successive interaction of life.
You should pay attention to this.
But I have full faith in it.
My young friends, you are very desperate to go to the exam centres.
Otherwise there is tension in the mind .
If you understand this information then you will not have time to regret.
I have also seen that the form of a question paper has changed when it comes into hand.
Rao has noted the issue of patience in his message.
Even in the words of at least, the beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rao Saheb, we heard that I was from Bangalore.
R.
Rao says.
I am very well aware that there is uneasiness due to competitive examinations.
Don't worry.
Give you the best, this is what I tell my young friends.
But at the same time, it should also be kept in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
Decided what you have to do in life and do not leave it, you will succeed.
Don't forget that you are the lakers of this world, like trees and hills, you also have the right to stay here.
You need it of pride, dedication and dedication.
These qualities will enable you to succeed in all the tests and other efforts.
I congratulate you all for what you want to do.
Many blessings.
"How is a scientific method of telling questions
It takes me half an hour to say in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific science.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring children across the country.
He spoke of dedication, determination and diligence.
Friends standing steadily.
If you stand steadfast then you will also get scared.
And the golden future will wait for you to be empowered with your hands.
Ruchika Dabbus has sent a message to me.
And it is true that the Secretary also said that positive perspective, positive perspective, positive perspective and positive energy.
There is a lot of things that inspire us, do not think that only students get inspiration.
Any moment of life, the best generosity and the truth inspires us, gives us greater strength and a new path on the strength of this inspiration.
We live in the course of academic information about VJ Divya Janak Thomas Alva Adison.
But, my friends, how many years have they spent for this research
He did not take any special education of the subject of mathematics, but in different fields like mathematics classification, Anksiddhandan, Ramanujan put a lot of pearls.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this power was important for them.
Today, the examinations are not just students but also of all families, schools and teachers.
Shri Vijay Jindal said that the parents should not put their burden on the children.
And we don't like it, but we don't like it.
We feel that we should also progress at the pace of science.
This is because today is the National Science Day.
He made the Nobel laureate for this research.
And in the memory of this, we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day across the country.
This is the birthplace of science.
Everyone has to pay attention to scientific thoughts, everybody has to be attracted to science and every generation has to pay attention to new research.
Without the participation of science and technology, new research is not possible.
Today, on National Science Day, a new research should be encouraged across the country.
I am sir C.
Friends, Sometimes it takes a long time to achieve success and when success is achieved, our attitude towards the world also changes.
We must have heard that in the past few days, there has been a great and important research in the world of science.
Scientists from all over the world have concentrated, many generations have come, some or the other.
INSTIN's theory of the last century was fostered by this research, not only this, it has been a great discovery in the field of physics.
It is a matter of fact that the entire human society will benefit the entire world.
In this entire research process, we have a special pride and joy as an Indian for the well-known and skilled scientists of our country.
Our scientists will try to further this new research in the coming days.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, a decision has been taken recently in this regard.
The government has decided to set up the Laser Interfamiter Gravitational Web Observatory (LIGO) in India to achieve the foundation stone of this research.
There are two such centres in the world and the third will be in India.
With Indias participation, this process will provide a new strength and a new dimension.
India will be actively involved in this great scientific research of human welfare on the strength of limited resources.
My dear countrymen, if I tell you a number then touch it.
By giving a missed call on this number, you can listen to your heart from tomorrow.
You can also hear in your mother tongue.
The number for Missed Collection is 8190881908 and I reiterate 81908881908.
Friends, I am also pleased to exam tomorrow.
25 billion Indians will take my exams.
Yesterday, I was tested that Parva would start with you.
And when we all succeed, the country will succeed.
Friends, I wish you all the best.
Being free from the stress of success and unsuccessfulness, move forward with a free mind.
I said two things in the last consignment Mann Ki Baat.
Recently, we celebrated Christmas and now we have started a new year of reception.
India has been diversely destroyed.
There is a synergy of festivals.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is based.
Whether the whole world is free from crisis, whether terrorism or global temperature rises, whether it is natural crisis or whether it is human organised, whether it is human beings, whether it is comfortable and peaceful
You know that I use a lot of technology, I get a lot of information about different subjects.
I always see this portal MyGov.
People go to different places to celebrate the holidays of Christmas.
Saveshwarkar says that wherever there are tourist places, dharamshalas, religious places, there should be special focus on cleanliness.
And as we say, "Gentlemen, brothers and sisters, when we are coming to visit our house, we clean our houses and we live in our houses.
Therefore, we should take special care of cleanliness in our tourist destinations and religious places.
Deep Singh Malviya lives in Bhojpura village in Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh at a young age.
I thought it would come to my rescue and reach you.
Deep Singh Malviya, who lives in Chhotayasya village, decided that if someone provides the goods to build toilets in the village, they will not take the responsibility of constructing toilets, they will provide free of cost.
Assuming that the construction of toilets is a sacred work, Deep Singh built a hundred toilets in Bhojpura village.
I sincerely congratulate Dilip Singh Malviya.
This country is progressing rapidly due to the unprecedented hard work of many people.
When every Indian knows that the whole world is attracted to this thing, and the whole world celebrates International Day of Yoga and the whole world is connected with it, we believe that this is our Hindustan.
When we see the universal form, this belief is created in your mind.
The topic of cleanliness is now discussed in a way at home.
Enhanced the participation of the citizens.
Its immense advantage is that those government employees who work to provide electricity to the villages, they will get the solution, they will work to transform the lives of a village through the medium of publicity, they will get the pleasure of providing it to the farmers, the poor, the women, the youth and the youth.
And if the government does not do any work, it is their right to get it and they should reach it not to be lost.
We should make efforts to ensure that the good things, good things and the useful things of the common man reach them.
This means service in a way.
I have made a small effort on my behalf.
I cannot do this alone, but when I tell you, I shouldn't do anything.
We have to reach up to 1. 25 billion Indians.
How can I reach without your help
In the language of the common man, we will reach them and inspire them to get their rights.
My young friends, in my speech from the Red Fort on August 15, I had first discussed the theme Start-Up India Stand-Up India.
After that, the work started in every account of the government, every department.
Can India be the world capital in Start Up
In a new way, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for young people in our territories, whether it is production, service sector or farming sector.
In every case, new ideas, new experiments and new efforts are needed and the world will not move forward.
Start up India, Stand up India scheme is a big opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India will present the entire work of Start-Up India scheme.
But it is not like that. We have to change it as per the requirements of India.
Our young friend is expected to put a research on the hard work and the hard work of a poor person.
I also appeal to the State Governments to take initiatives in this regard.
On 16th January, I will speak more widely to you.
I will always welcome your information.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, crores of people from this country have been inspired by Swami Vivekananda.
His Jayanti is celebrated as National Youth Festival since 12th January, 1995.
This year, the event will be held at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
I am aware that Yanda's concept is Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Homoeopathy.
In his school, Excellencies India Day celebrated the Sulabhsankar Bharat Diwas and expressed his feelings on the telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet those people who work in society, there are many thoughts in their minds.
Now it is true that every word has its own unique importance.
This year, the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan. I had to go to the programme but I had not been able to attend the programme of Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Maharashtra.
But I was thinking about going to that programme.
I thought that in our country we should use the term Disabled instead of the word 'Divyang'.
These are those people who have only or more parts of the country who have a divinity, have a divinity and a transformation of divinity, which are not like ourselves.
I liked this word a lot.
Will the citizens of my country now propagate the word Disabled instead of Disabled
I hope that we take this idea forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan that day.
These infrastructure reforms have been implemented directly and indirectly and can lead to ease of living for the people of the disabled.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations, simplified parking, accessible entrepreneurship, braille, etc.
They like this.
We should also participate in it in our own way.
My dear countrymen, government schemes are going on continuously, but this scheme should be taken care of only artificial intelligence.
We have to reach the last segment in a better way.
They should not breathe in files.
Because these schemes are envisaged by the Government of India a few days back to provide benefits to the common man, the poor man and the needy.
Grants are given to LPG cylinders in our country.
This amount is worth crores of rupees but we did not have the mechanism to ensure that it has not reached the beneficiaries in the right time.
The government made some changes in it.
With the help of Jan Dhan Bank Accounts and Aadhaar card, the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme has been implemented and the amount of subsidy has started to be deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I would like to assure you that this initiative has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records as the worlds largest and successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
The scheme is known by the name of Pahal.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LPG holders have been benefitted.
This subsidy has been directly deposited in bank accounts of 15 crore people.
There is no need for any recommendations, there is no possibility of misconduct.
On the one hand, Aadhaar card, opening public accounts on the other hand, and on the other hand, the state government and the central government are working together to create a list of beneficiaries, connect them with Aadhaar numbers and accounts.
A few days back, MNREGA will provide employment opportunities to the villages.
There were many complaints about it.
I am confident that around 35 to 40 schemes are now being included under the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment.
The centenary of Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary is the centenary year of Rapya Mahotsav.
On the occasion of Parliament, a two-day special discussion was held on the Constitution and it was done very well.
All the parties have discussed the importance of decisiveness, the importance of deliberations and the basic definition of deliberations. We have to continue this initiative.
Can we work to connect the people with power and power with the people on the occasion of the Republic Day
There should always be discussions and discussions about the fact that the deficit has given us great powers.
It is our sacred duty to make a big glimpse of whether it is written on the walls.
"Why does not happen in the life of everyday when we talk about our duties
On the occasion of 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, what is the pleasure of organising a poetry competition, poetry competition and artificiality competition on the subject of duties in schools, colleges, villages and societies of the city.
125 crore Indians will be able to make a big history if they move ahead with a duties.
I want to know your thoughts.
Send your writing to my portal MyGov.
I want to know what the youngsters think about the duties of my country.
And I don't speak from the government level.
We build the effigies of great men with great faith, but then we are sad about taking care of them.
On the other hand, the construction of coal was also started.
Festivals are one of the most important elements in the society.
Sometimes these festivals burst on sadness and sometimes create new ones.
But sometimes if there is any crisis during these festivals then it is very painful.
There are reports of natural calamities from all corners of the world.
There are reports of such natural calamities that we have never heard or thought.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is.
The way in which we have been raining in the last few days and the way in which we have suffered losses in Tamil Nadu and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I have shared this crisis with the sadness of all those families.
The State Governments are working with full strength and help.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that even after this crisis in Tamil Nadu, he will again start moving forward with confidence and the role he plays in the development of the country will pass.
But when we look at the crisis all around, we need to make many changes in it.
15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the agriculture sector because at that time natural calamities were limited to the time being.
Today, its form is changing.
We need to increase our capacity at every level.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens and all small institutions will have to work from the point of view of science.
After the earthquake of Nepal, I interacted with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and suggested that we should come together and do a joint exercise to combat the threat.
I am glad that the workshop of SAARC countries was held in Delhi on discussions and best practices.
A good start has taken place.
Today, Lakhvinder Singh has called me from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I am speaking from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We make organic farming here and also guide many to this farming.
My question is that those people who set fire to palms or wheat plants cannot understand how to guide them to the microbes of the earth and how to get rid of pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
I am very happy to hear Lakhvinder Singh's questions.
Be happy because you are organic farming and you are not only doing organic farming but also knowing the problems of the farmers.
Your concern is good but it is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of the people of the entire country and in a traditional way we burn the remains of the crops.
But the pain that you have expressed is correct.
The first step on this is that if we train our farmers brothers and sisters in this regard and tell them the situation of truth, if the remaining remains of the crops are burnt then the crops will be produced for the next crops.
But this is not true.
We destroy them, but if we break these ruins into small pieces then it will be a dry farm for the animals.
Secondly, after burning it, the upper surface of the earth burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a while, if you think that your bones should be stronger, your heart should be stronger, your kidneys should be good, everything should be well but if the skin of the body burns then what will happen
We cannot live even if the heart is healthy.
Just as we burn the skin of our body then it is difficult to stay alive , in the same way not only sneezes on the skin of the pigs but also burns the skin of the soil of the mother .
If we use animals as a fodder, not only our land remains saved, but if we put the fertilizer produced in the same land then it will also benefit.
The water in those pots is sufficient for those pieces and today their pots have also got peels.
They are now getting income from these pegs too.
Earlier, the supplements that had to be spent for cleanliness have also become the means of income and the demand is increasing.
Dear Countrymen, the next 3rd December is being celebrated as International Disabled Day.
27th November is celebrated as the Indian Organ Day.
The film actress Ravina Tandon and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.
Due to organ donation many precious life can be saved .
Organ donation provides immortality in a way.
When an organ from one body goes to another body then that organ gets a new life but that person also gets a new life .
What can be the best donor
A National Register on 27th November has been launched for patients, organs and organ transplants waiting for transplantation.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this sector and in the true sense, the needy will get the best help because no one can get the help until they donate the organs.
As I said earlier, the 3rd December is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also adventurous and capable persons .
When such people are ignored then they are tortured.
Sometimes they are shown mercy.
But if we change our vision of seeing them then we will know that these people can inspire us to live life.
You can inspire me to do something.
If there is a small crisis on us then we are crying.
And then we realize that my crisis is very small.
How can it live our lives
How do we work
And that is why all these are inspirations for us.
Their determination is to reverse their system of life and the power to reverse the crisis.
I want to tell him today that he is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Guad Ahmad was shot by terrorists in Kashmir.
One part of the abdomen and the intestine is lost .
Mann Ki Baat was also seriously injured.
He lost his strength to stand on his feet, but he did not believe that he was a martyr.
How to improve infrastructure for physically challenged persons
How can we develop facilities for the disabled at public places, government offices
He is working on these things.
Isn't it enough to make their lives inspiring every corner of the country
I remember Jawad Ahmad Jis life, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
Because of the lack of time, I have not only mentioned the need to go but many such inspirations are inspiring every corner of the country.
They are giving new lights to live and show new paths.
Whether the middle class, the poor, the poor, the deprived, the deprived, the deprived, the government and the government system are constantly associated with it and sometimes the poor experiences of some government servants have been adversely experienced and some bad experience changes its perspective towards the government system throughout the lifetime.
This is also true, but millions of people of this government do such good work in service and dedication, which is never seen in our eyes.
Last year we presented a joint Padma Vibhushan to both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
He works very largely in India.
After his retirement and whatever he has earned for the entire life, he is spending his work for the poor.
When they come to India, they appreciate the hope that they have got the opportunity to work with the workers and tell them how dedicated and hard worked towards this hope.
He tells them how much enthusiasm he has to learn innovations.
Just a few days back, the Orissa government had specially honored a hope worker on his Independence Day.
And a hope worker from this village, Jamuna Mani Singh, decided that no one in Tedagaon will die due to malaria.
Going to every household and knowing that there was a slight fever.
There will be many more such jamuna Mani.
There will be lakhs of people who are around us.
We have come to them with a little respect.
Such people are the greatest strengths of our country.
How are the big partners of the happiness and misery of the society
I extend my warm greetings to all such hopes through the "Jamuna Mani".
My dear young friends, I am particularly active on the Internet and Social Media for the young generation.
Not only this, they also showed to others, they might be saved and it might be that we will come to add something to it.
positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to join this nation.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is contemplating climate change.
There is talk of climate change, global temperature rise, care is also there and every work has been accepted as a standard before it is done.
The Earth's temperature should not be further increased.
This is the responsibility of everybody and the care is also there.
And the first way to avoid the temperature is to save energy.
14th December is the National Energy Savings Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
I had once said that on the night of full moon, the roads should be closed and darkened and kept in the light of the moon throughout the hour.
One should experience the light of that moon.
On seeing a woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur on TV, it seemed that she had not got the opportunity to learn a lot.
But he is doing such a thing that perhaps no one has thought about it.
He is shining the lives of the poor by using solar energy.
He is fighting with darkness and brightening his lips.
He has created a committee of women and started a solar power-driven wooden factory and will pay a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
What kind of help is being provided to our businessmen like this
Industry, earnings, equivalent.
The speed at which I have to go continuously is very likely to come.
But the beginning has improved.
Under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, about 66 lakh people have received Rs.
I am happy that there are 24 lakh women out of 66 lakh women and those who are unsuccessful in getting help, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, who are working hard on their feet and are trying to run their families.
The Abhishek has spoken of his zeal.
There are many news coming to me too.
Someone told me that somebody in Mumbai is in the form of a Shailesh Bhosle.
During my Swachhta Mohammad, I had said that the Swachhta Mohammad is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and showcase them with Shailesh Bhosle.
And I am told that in such a short time he has returned two lakh rupees to the bank.
He is working to build potatoes.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor.
In fact, these people run the economy of the country.
Small scale industries are the economic powers of the country.
We have to give him more strength.
But we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October or on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed the 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'.
These are the things that should keep sustained awareness in social life.
Efficiency is an award for freedom under the National Awareness Year.
How should the programme be started
I had told you about sending such information.
I was told that there was a lot of information.
But I am required more information.
I expect a very specific scheme.
There can be many such things.
I am confident that our information will definitely be useful.
But I would like to assure you that you should exercise.
In order to keep the body balanced certainly use this excellent season for exercise .
So, if there is a deserted season then you should also make sweeping habits.
My best wishes to my countrymen once again.
Once again I am visiting you with Mann Ki Baat.
The fifth one-day cricket is being played between India and South Africa.
The name of this cricket match is Gandhi-Mandela series.
Both the Unions have confronted each and every two faces, and therefore the importance of our last meeting has been increased.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today I would like to congratulate the friends of Kannur Akashwani.
I would like to assure you that whenever I started my heart talks, many people visited this programme, the students of the twelfth of Kerala also joined the programme.
I once again want to talk about Kerala.
Students from St. Mary Upper Primary School, Kochi Chittor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
Initially, I didn't understand, if I was surprised that these children made me the map of India by the pieces of the thumb.
When I read their letters, I realized how big a symbolic message they have given.
So that the organ donation becomes a trend and trend.
These girls have written a letter to me to challenge people about organ donations from our Mann Ki Baat programme.
He has consistently launched a movement of 80 years old Vasantarao Sudke Gurujee in Maharashtra.
He said Angan donation should be a festival.
Hallie, I also receive a lot of messages from the phone.
Devesh in Delhi has also given me a message.
I believe that this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people in our country need kidneys, heart and liver every year.
But in our country, only five thousand transplants i . . organ transplantations are operated.
Every year one lakh dollars are needed but only 25,000 people get eyes.
When we need four dollars, we can only give one dollar.
Efforts have been made to guide the States.
Some states have done a good job to accelerate the efforts of our organ donation by reducing the paperwork.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of the organ donation.
A lot of social institutions, very NGOs have worked well and have given a different direction.
The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been set up to give importance to organ transplant.
The joy that Tektan Bhunjitha means is the best.
Last month, we all had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
A life was saved.
Dear Countrymen, we have now celebrated Navaratri and Vijaya Dashmi.
A few days later, we will celebrate Diwali.
Celebrated Eid, celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi
But one more festival is going to be celebrated in all these, it will be the pride of our countrymen and it will give the country the pride.
The India-Africa Foreign Summit will be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October.
For the first time in India, such a big event will be organised.
54 African countries and Union Leaders have been invited.
The population of India is as much as the population of African people.
If both populations are collected then one-third of the population of the world will be population.
And it is said that the landscapes of these two countries were together millions of years ago.
Later, the Indian Ocean divided into two parts.
And look at our efforts that people should also meet and come together.
On this occasion, the Government of India has made a big programme by HRD Ministry.
An essay competition was organised in children in the schools where the CBSE's Affiliated Schools were held, poetry writings were organised and all of them were attended.
About 1600 schools participated.
This included schools outside India and India and thousands of schoolchildren in the interest of strengthening Indo-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the Memorial of Mahatma Gandhis birthplace from Porbandar, which is a mobile exhibition, is going from Porbandar to Northern State and reaches Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren witnessed this exhibition and people from villages also witnessed this exhibition.
The great role played by Mahatma Gandhi in the relations between Africa and the countries of India, the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on these two landscapes was known.
Although the Indo-Africa Summit is there, I see this opportunity to connect people.
I extend my warm greetings to the children, more than 1600 schools and HRD Ministers.
On August 15, I had made a proposal in the context of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
In the last month, there was a workshop in Bhopal wherein the heads of the ideal villages, the collectors there, some parliamentarians, the Government of India, the state government, together discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Just a few enthusiastic things have been remembered.
He has chosen to play an ideal role in the Parsi Gram Panchayati in Kunti district of Jharkhand.
Efforts have been made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand with the help of infrastructure and system in Adarsh village.
I congratulate the respected Parliamentarian Shriyut Kariya Mundanji.
Similarly, I got a news from Andhra.
Ashok Gajapati Rajuji Adarsh Gram Yojana, a Member of Parliament of Andhra, and he chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat as Adarsh Gram in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
The children taught about 550 adult illiterates, literate them.
See, there is no budget in the society, no circular, no special system, but how many changes are brought due to the will power, it is being seen through rural divide.
However, our respected Parliamentarian Shri Yut C.
L. Ruwala, this is the Member of Parliament of Mizoram.
He has chosen Khawalahilang village as an ideal village. He has done a special job.
This village is very famous for production of cumin and jaggery .
How can the village be made a financial vision centre, how to market the production of the village.
Ruwala ji, who is trying to make a self-reliant village along with Adarsh village, is a congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, there is a 'Mann Ki Baat' and it will never be possible to talk about cleanliness.
I would like to remind you that my dear countrymen, after the Diwali celebrations last year, media had played a special mission, after Diwali, all those things were shown on the channel to the people.
Just as we worry about the accidents before the festival, we should do it even after the festival.
And for this, I would like to congratulate the Middle East of India.
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, I had the privilege to participate in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan by the India Today Group.
He was watching the dreams given by the Clean India Awards.
How are the people who are doing work like One Life, One Mission
How many places are there in our country which have been kept so clean.
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has started, I have seen that Andhra Telengana's e-Nadu and especially Shri Yut Ramuji Rao are very old but their enthusiasm is not less than a young man.
He added 51 lakh children from around 55-56 schools to Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, parks, cleanliness-related campaigns have been conducted in many places.
Now this news shows the power to realize this dream of Swachh Bharat.
ABP News launched the programme called Bharat Nation Hai Mera and made people aware about cleanliness and worked hard to train the countrymen.
NDTV will create a campaign called Swachh Bharat.
In Meghalaya where our Governor Shri Yut Shanmukh Nathan has written a letter to me and mentioned the village of Mavalannong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years this village has raised the issue of cleanliness.
About every generation is dedicated to cleanliness, it is said that some years ago they had received the Cleanest Village Award in Asia.
This is important that we all have to make beliefs that our country will definitely be clean and it will be done by the efforts of the people of the country, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we can say 100 crore people with pride and pride.
My dear countrymen, I had said this from the Red Fort on August 15, there are some things where corruption has demanded and made houses.
We listen to all these news and that is why I thought that what is the need of the Internet for small jobs.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in this world who can fully identify a person by taking one or two minutes
And with this idea, I had announced that we should shut down the tradition of slaughtering for this small job.
My dear young friends, I would like to express my pride that the government has completed all these processes and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be supplied.
This rule will be enforced from 1st January, 2016 and wherever the process of recruitment is underway, we will not avail the expenditure, but this method will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
In our country, gold has become an important part of social life.
Gold can become a power, gold can become a economic power.
And every Indian must contribute in this.
Under this, we can deposit our gold in the gold bank and the bank will pay you a tax on it just as you collect your money.
Earlier we used to put gold in the locker and also used to pay the locker.
Now keep it in the gold bank and the bank will pay you a tax.
Now the countrymen, cannot become a golden wealth
The second thing is that this bond is a paper in the Sovereign Gold bond but the value of that paper is the same.
On the day when this paper is returned, you will get the amount of money that is the price of gold.
I am happy to say that we are bringing gold quins.
The Gold ueen of Ashok Chakra brought about 70 years of independence, but till date we have been using the Foreign Gold ueen.
Gold billin bonds are also used abroad.
In the coming weeks, we will also provide it to the common man before Dhanteras and we are launching golden coins of five grams and 10 grams of Ashok Chakra.
Besides, the gold transactions of 20 grams will be available for the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new transformation in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October is the birth anniversary of Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel.
One Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel recalled that the map of India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot in the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
India is filled with diversity, diversity, diversity, diversity, diversity, diversity and beauty.
If this diversity is not there then we cannot respect the glory and beauty of this glory.
Therefore, there is a mantra of unity of diversity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the true roots of development.
Over the past few years, on 31st October, the Rain-For-Unity programmes are being organized across the country.
Ekta Ki Douda is also a true source of development.
Bless Sardar Saheb.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, now you are engaged in the preparation of Diwali, the house will be cleaned.
You are buying new things.
Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
My best wishes to you on the occasion of Diwali.
Due to bursting fires, burstings cause a lot of damage to the children.
I would like to tell every mother-in-law that Diwali was enjoyed but don't let the accident happen, don't hurt the child of our family and you have to think and clean it.
My dear countrymen, the next day of Diwali, I will visit Briton.
The Government of India and the State Government of India will be a part of this class of society, be it tribal or backward, give scholarships to children who go abroad for studying.
I am confident that when our children will be taught in Briton, then Babasaheb's place will become a motivational place. Babasaheb gave this message to the country that I am thrilled because of my visit to Briton, it was like this for years.
Now you can imagine how much pleasure will be felt by the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar that the building will become the wealth of 125 crore countrymen.
I am going to get another opportunity in London to unveil the statue of Lord Vishweshwar.
Many years ago, the world needs to study the work done by Lord Vishwaswar for democracy and for the Employment of Women.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Visvesvara on the land of London is an excellent example of how many years ago, the great men of India thought and thought of vision.
My dear countrymen, you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat.
There were discussions with the government officials.
Some people try to solve problems while writing their problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn such languages
But I am grateful to the Akashwani that at 8 o'clock in the night of my heart, every state broadcasts in their regional language.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes.
Jai Hind
On the 3rd of August, I will be fortunate to announce my heart for the first time.
Democratic manpower is immensely important.
There is a basic idea in my life and that is why I am confident of the strength of the people.
But what I learned from the news, what I felt, I can tell you that the people's power is inadequate than that.
Our ancestors used to say that Janta Jannadan is a part of God.
I can tell you that there is a great power in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this.
I want to ask for information from the people for the news of my heart. I want to see only two or four information.
But in the number of millions, people became active and sent information.
This is a great strength.
When people were looking at it, they also felt that the feeling of sadness and misery of the girl child would have to be changed.
This was a silent revolution.
Keeping in front of the tourism dollars in India, I told the citizens that Incredible India, incomplete India.
People from every part of India have sent lakhs of photographs.
The government of India or the tourism departments of the state government have never felt that we have so much wealth.
There was a lot of money spent on one platform and the government did not spend one rupee.
People did all this.
Today, I can say with great joy that in the last one year, the sale of khadi has doubled.
I once used to tell you that the poor households are rotten, the children are crying, their poor mothers are the pictures.
Do not they get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society then the government can work as a catalyst for social transformation.
Every small thing has been accepted by you and tried to connect yourself with the countrymen.
What can be more enjoyment than this
I would like to use a new one in my heart.
He requested the citizens of the country to send your questions, information and your proposals to me from the phone.
In my heart, I will pay attention to it.
I am happy that more than five and a half thousand phones have come from across the country, whether it is Siachen, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is no such state in India from where people did not call.
This is a pleasant experience.
The people of all the age groups asked him and asked for consideration.
I heard some of it myself, but I feel like doing my best on the other issues.
You might have taken one-two minutes to telephone this, but the answers, thoughts and issues that have been received for me are important.
The entire government will definitely work on this.
I am aware of the importance of radio for such blind people.
From a new perspective, I am seeing and many good things, good issues are sufficient for the government to be sensitive.
I would like to invite the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi to the people of India to use more and more soil utensils in Diwali through the message of this time.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to stay with the soldiers of the army for two to three hours.
Navy and Air Force to protect water, soil and sky.
The war that took place in 1965 with Pakistan ended 50 years.
During the war, we used to not only listen to the moments of pride, pride, courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, but also the system of photographing and sports, but also through this exhibition, the vision of the martyrdom of the soldiers is sure.
Whether it is Hajifir's fight, whether it is in the north or the Chamida, it is thrilling to see the scene of victory near Hajifir Pass and the glorious feelings of the Indian Army come to the fore.
If you want to make history then you will have to understand the small issues of it.
Because of history, our bonds remain with our children.
If we break the legends of history then the possibility of building history gets a complete break.
A small boy has given an order to the Prime Minister, but he has forgotten to tell his name in a hurry.
I have announced the campaign in the context of Swachh Bharat on October 2 and I can tell you that there is a lot of discussion on the topic of cleanliness and cleanliness in the Parliament before Independence.
There were also comments on our government.
I would like to hear too much that Modi used to talk about cleanliness but what do you mean
I don't feel bad by listening to this, but it shows me a good thing about Indias cleanliness in the Parliament of the country.
On the other hand, on the other hand, when this small child of the country speaks about cleanliness then there can be no such thing for the country.
This movement is going on, it is seen that awareness about the ideas, deliberations and cleanliness is being created.
It will also make the government functional and it will be imperative to work.
In the year 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we have worked towards this direction to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
You're sure what Mahatma Gandhi says
At one place, he said that if the time has come for one of the two freedom and cleanliness, then I will give priority to cleanliness and cleanliness was more important for Gandhiji after independence.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi, Mygov.
My dear countrymen, we get constant inspiration from the lives of great men.
This great man was an ideal ray of values is not yours.
All those who live for the country and die for the country are inspiring us.
This day is an opportunity to remember all these great men.
On 25th September, there will be countless names like Deendayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jayaprakash Narayan ji, on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and I also say that this country is multi-dimensional.
If you take a look, you will find the name of any great man connected with that line in the eyes of history.
Especially for 2nd October, I once again request you.
On 2nd October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapuji Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot do by spending a lot of cautiously will be done due to your small work and help.
This is the manpower and therefore I once again request you to do this thing.
Dear Countrymen, my heart is enjoying one thing.
Chandra Bose had made all arrangements with the son of Subhash Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family took this step in mind and in the last few weeks, there was a strong news that 50 of Subhash Babu's households would be more deprived and the family Prime Minister would be visiting the house.
You can imagine how happy it will be for me.
He will get the opportunity to visit the Prime Minister's residence together, often the first time.
But I am glad that there has never been a visit to the Prime Minister's residence before, which I will be fortunate to do in October.
More than 50 young people, family members, some different countries, and all the issues will be required.
What a joyful moment for me.
I would like to invite the Prime Minister to awaken the younger generation about the registration of the voters, to increase the participation of the youth in the coming days and to support the youth in the future to select and run the government.
I hope that those youngsters who have not yet registered their names will also register and will also do the same.
The seventh student of Dakshitij Pandey visited me in the University of Anarash Hindu, in the seventh edition of the University of Central University.
He has great self-confidence.
In this young age, I have seen the interest of physics that it would be very reading.
The daughter of Sadavvrat Patel, who lives in Sunderpur in Varanasi.
On the other hand, his brother said, Yes, if all these mathematical books are taken in hand, then by the end of the evening, everything opens up in history.
We all feel surprised that I was very impressed.
Sometimes such children get enjoyment but I do not know anything about Sonam.
I feel that Devan has given a power.
My visit to Kashi included a meeting of two children.
Similarly, the meetings of these two children will be held in my memory.
Many people are suggesting new things to me through the message of mind.
Similarly, what do you say in Sandeep, Haryana, Sir Mann Ki Baat once a month, do it every week because you are very inspired by your speeches.
Sandeep ji, what do you do with me
I have to work hard once in a month and I have to make arrangements for the time being.
There has been a time in the current month.
In a way, one year is full of mind.
You know how much to use Subhash Babu radio
From Germany, he used to inaugurate his radio centres and to give information to the people of India from this radio centre for the freedom movement.
He inaugurated the Azad Hind Radio by a weekly newspaper.
He used to run this radio from English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and Parsi Urdu in all languages.
I am also celebrating one year after expressing my heart through the skylines.
Send your information, thoughts and proposals.
It also benefits the government.
The reforms are initiated.
Your contribution, your participation is invaluable and invaluable.
Once again, my best wishes to you all.
The citizens of South India have been celebrating the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Keeping in mind the issue of social security, the Government of India has launched several new schemes for the common people.
I am happy that in a short span of time everyone accepted this scheme.
I had requested our sisters to visit these security schemes on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have been told that since the launch of this scheme, about 11 crore families have been associated with them and I have been told that about the benefits of these schemes have been received by the mothers and sisters.
I extend my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, while talking to you, I have taken the Jan Dhan Yojana in large numbers for a year.
The banking sector is also an important part of the economy and the bank friendly scheme has been strengthened to provide this facility to the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 billion bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got jobs.
We will be happy to note that in this one year we will organize 1 lakh 31 thousand financial literacy camps to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
We should not stop opening the accounts alone.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facility under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
It has been believed that the poor can get money from the bank.
I once again congratulate all those who open their accounts in the bank and ask the poor brothers and sisters of the poor to keep your bank accounts intact.
This bank is yours, do not leave it anymore.
I have brought the bank to you, it is your job to hold it now.
Due to the recent incidents in Gujarat, the entire country was restless due to violence and it is a matter of fact that if something happens on the ground of Gandhiji and Sardar then the entire country is at the forefront.
But in a very short span of time, all my senior brothers and sisters from Gujarat brought the situation under control.
The situation won't worsen, it played a positive role and once again started on the path of Gujarat peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood have been moving on the right path and development.
Development is the answer to our problems.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet the learned persons of Sufi sect.
I got the opportunity to listen to their thoughts and tell you the truth that I am aware of the experience of listening to music.
I came to speak to these scholars, selecting their words, speaking systems, liberality and gentleness in the Sufi tradition, which has a lure of music.
I was very sorry.
Often there is a need to reach the world in the true nature of Islam.
The message that has been linked with the love and compassion of the Sufi community will reach far and wide, which will benefit the people of human society, Islam and I also tell others that we are of any sect, understand the Sufi sect and the Sufi tradition.
I am very fortunate to have another opportunity in the coming days. And I am fortunate to have this invitation.
Buddhist traditional scholars from across the globe are going to visit Bodh Gaya in India and there will be discussions on the goods of humanity, welfare and global issues.
I am happy to be invited to visit Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
I am glad that I will get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with such learned persons around the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, today I once again want to tell you about my mind.
I had asked for this topic even before in my heart.
You must have heard me in my speech in Parliament, from the public meetings, from the news of my heart.
Every time I came to say that the Government of India is open in the matter of the land which is in the process of encroachment law.
This means that the situation that was before my government was formed has now been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to assure you that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just an announcement for us.
That mantra is the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on August 15, we used to say that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be established.
We are swiftly implementing this decision.
The war of 1965 had completed 50 years two days ago and when the issue of the war of 1965 came to light, Gandhiji remembered Lal Bahadur Scientists.
I salute all the brave people who have won India in the war of 65.
Such incidents of history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of Sufi sect in the last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to interact with the naming scientists from all over the country for hours.
I am glad to know that India is doing good work in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing great jobs.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it would be inspiring for me, and it would be better to teach new things.
And I saw how many young scientists used to speak enthusiasticly and many dreams were seen in their eyes.
During the last minute, I was told that students should move towards the field of science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities and there are many opportunities.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends would like to look at science, our educational institutions would inspire the students for that.
It has been written on skill development.
Shriman Prakash, Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu has stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
Emphasis has been laid on improving education sector.
In particular, I want to tell my young friends one thing.
In a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I used to say that for the lower level jobs, why is this interview
And when letters come for slaughter, every poor family and widow mother are contemplating that who will get a recommendation
Do not know what words are used
It was a cause for everyone to run and perhaps to be the lower level misconception.
I am happy to say that the government has taken a lot of steps in this short span of time just 15 days.
The information is being sent and the decision will not be taken for small posts.
It is unfortunate that every year about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die immediately after delivery and after delivery.
It is worrisome and frightening.
Similarly, there has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and newborns.
We look at the television but don't pay attention to the news papers but we don't see it.
Along with clean water it is important to keep small things clean at home .
Life is extremely precious.
It is not right to ignore waste water, sensitivity towards cleanliness is a cause of death.
Dengue checks are conducted at around 514 centres across the country.
The period of Raksha Bandhan to Diwali is the period of many festivals in our country.
Saying the cleanliness of every festival of ours, the quality of cleanliness will come in your own nature.
I always say that we will not get the privilege of giving life to the country, but we have got the privilege to live for the country.
Two young people of our country, two brothers and two brothers from Nashik, Maharashtra.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
How everybody is trying to take the country forward and this is the only one that is full of pride and pride.
Sometimes we commit injustice to our young people due to lack of understanding.
But my experience in the youth is different.
Sometimes we know and learn new things by talking to them.
Many young people who have told me that I have been taking this letter on the Sande on Cycle.
There is a determination of a few days in a week like Cycle-Day.
He said that it is enjoyable for health, environment to be better and young.
In our country, the number of cycle users increase in many households and many people encourage them.
I am happy to note that these efforts have been made to save the environment and to keep healthy and today my country's two youngsters have flagged off Indias flag in America, so the youth of India are also thinking about it.
Today I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The monument will inspire us to work for the deprived, exploited, deprived and deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that honor Ambedkar.
We can take the country forward by putting it on the shoulder.
My best wishes and thanks to all of you.
It will help our farmers brothers and sisters for the purchases.
I remembered one more thing that pleased myself and enjoyed.
Curds and oilseeds have always been divided into our country.
The poor people take rice, they need a little oil for food and vegetables.
I am happy that this year, the grains that have been handled have increased by 50 percent in the production of cereals and about 33 percent in the production of oilseeds.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July this date has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The relationship with the land of this country is also of the soldiers.
In Kargil war, one of our soldiers broke down on hundreds of enemies.
The war of Kargil was not just a war on the border, but every city in India, every village in India participated in it.
This fight was fought for the mothers and sisters of those young sons and brothers who were fighting against the enemy in Kargil.
The youngsters fought this war, when they saw their brave young children, who felt like they were young, they fought with the fingers of their fathers who did not even learn to walk.
This is because of the sacrifices of all these people, India can speak in front of the world.
After coming to power in 2014, we started the MyGov Movement on 26th July in a few months.
We have launched this indicator to enhance the participation of democracy to connect every citizen with development.
And today after a year, I am happy to say that about two crore people visited the MyGov.
About 5. 5 lakh citizens have registered their actions and especially more than 50 thousand citizens have registered information on PMO APPLICTIONS.
Is this the right thing that such people have difficulty getting rid of the train ticket
However, it looks smaller, but the government did not realize this thing, no one thought about it.
But Akhilesh has taken a dignified look at the issue and today a separate system has been implemented for the ticket reserves for our disabled brothers and sisters.
The new logos are generated, the two lines are generated, the programmes are designed and there are very positive information on MyGov.
It is realised that new winds are flowing in the governance system.
There is a sense of new consciousness.
MyGov information has been started in my speech on August 15.
From Chennai, Sumitra Raghav Chari has suggested a lot.
I believe that it is a good idea that the people of the country should suggest the issue in my speech on August 15.
I am confident that you will definitely give good information.
I am conscious that it will reach you.
I don't want to preach anybody, but I don't want to take a pledge from the responsibility of the central government, the state government or the local health institution.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was disturbed in a wounded condition for nearly ten minutes.
Hoshakote Akshay of Bangalore, Amay Joshi of Pune and Prasanja Kakunj of Murbidri in Karnataka have expressed their concern over this issue.
One person dies every four minutes in road accidents.
However, I invite my parents to take care of your children that they will be able to get their children from the house and their parents will be able to get their education from the house.
The government has taken a lot of new initiatives in this regard, whether it is a road safety system for the people, whether it is road construction system or whether it is a road safety system for the accidents.
Keeping this in mind, we are going to demand the Transport and Security Bill.
We are supposed to take several important steps in the coming days to implement the National Road Safety Policy and the Road Safety Action Plan.
This scheme is a cashless treatment for roads from Gurgaon, Jaipur, Baroda, Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia.
It means that we are giving priority to provide medical assistance to those injured in the accidents in 50 hours after the accident, whether they are nearly payable or not.
In order to provide information about the accident, 1033 Toll Free Phoney No.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that accidents will not occur originally because one life and the lives of each are more important.
Sometimes I tell you that the worker should be comfortable.
In the last few days, I thought I should talk to you about it.
But how to bring consciousness in handicapped work
Bishwal has shown the victory of our love and art capabilities.
There is a possibility that they will be spoken about the picture, and I got to know one more thing.
The entire team of government officials in Madhya Pradesh, Harda district, and a different work started by the Union, touched my heart.
I liked this thing and you would like to know that it was a different thing when these officers started the Mission Operation Malayudh.
But it is important to give a new turn to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
There is a camp named Kashla near Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh .
The people of this village constructed toilets in an effortful manner.
Now no one in this village goes open for toilets and when the work of toilets is completed, the village of Kashla celebrated a festival like this.
The best examples of how the values of social life change, how the minds of the people change and how the citizens of the country are taking the path of progress.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written about questions related to the North East.
However, people from the north-eastern region are active.
They will talk to the officers of the administration, the people will talk to the representatives and the citizens.
They will know their problems. They will do whatever is possible by the central government to solve these problems.
One of the best efforts to move east of Delhi, the Cut East Policy which I say is the same.
My dear countrymen, the success of Mangal Mission is a matter of pride and joy to all of us.
We know this news but we don't notice it.
I often urge the IAS officers of the government to go to a school, college, and interact with the students there in a school nearly two-four hours a week.
This work is difficult but it has to be done.
During the examination time there is no electricity therefore do not differ in the practice of children .
If you want to start a small business and industry in the village then there will be electricity.
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere to get mobile phones, others have to go to the village.
We have done this, we have started it.
Today, I felt like speaking to you on different topics from Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes to all of you for this.
You must send your information and new ideas for August 15, I will definitely be useful.
Mann Ki Baat, 2019
I used to feel that there is a shortage.
We used to listen to many things once again, in a slightly light environment, in the family of 130 crore countrymen.
Sometimes yourself had been inspired by yourself.
We can imagine how this holiday period has taken place.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month - at 11 in the morning, our meeting was held.
I used to feel that I used to do something Miss.
And whenever I talk about Mann Ki Baat, even though I used to speak alone, and that word might be mine, sound mine, but that story is yours, males are yours, males are yours.
I used to use my words and my speech.
There was a feeling of unity in the mind.
Once the elections have come to mind, now the elections have been over, then we will have to speak four things in our country.
But then I thought it was not.
Your program is a Sunday and it should continue.
But these Sundays brought us a lot to wait.
Small, simple and slight things are also being used to transform the lives of society.
This sequence is a part of it and it gives birth to a new energy, a pure consciousness and in a sense it is necessary to move ahead with this sequence by giving support to the consciousness and energy of a New India.
In the last few months, many messages have come and many people are doing 'Mann Ki Baat'.
Whenever I read this message, whenever I hear it, I feel sorry.
This is my journey from Ahm to Vyam.
This Monsoon interaction with you for me was a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have heard a lot of questions about my visit to Kedarnath in the Dhamdhumi of the election.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will also be curious to know the answers of these questions.
I am sure that in the valleys of Kedar, I am sure that I have got the opportunity to fill this pocket in the cave in the shore of Kedar.
Just as many people have expressed their willingness to know about Kedar visits, your efforts to strengthen a positive thing, I feel consistent with your speeches.
The letters that come for Mann Ki Baat, which get inputs, are different from the routine, that is, the daily government.
Sometimes the letters sent by you were also inspired by me in a way.
Sometimes you have some words to embrace my thought process.
I understand the challenges faced by the people of the country and society.
In addition to this, people are also telling us what is the answer to these problems.
I am aware that people ask for their problems in the letters and also write what answers they have.
Its answers to the pair of questions, some or the other new ideas, or the other.
Mann Ki Baat is like a glass for the country and society.
Today my heart is filled with joy.
Last time I had said that now we met for three-four months, some people had taken out the political meaning and people said, "Hey, Modi ji has so much self-confidence.
This self-confidence was not of some Modis.
So this belief was the foundation of your belief.
You all used to take the form of trust.
And that is why I had said in Akher's Mann Ki Baat very easily that I will speak to you a few months later.
And you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
If we move ahead with this spirit then we will continue the sequence of Mann Ki Baat as before.
The movement was limited to the prison.
In the minds and minds of the people, there was anger in the hearts.
Democratic disturbances were felt in the minds.
Whenever you get food at the time, you dont know what hungry means.
Similarly, the importance of democratic rights is that of the people.
During the coming days, every citizen of the country used to feel that you had snatched something.
Even if someone has laughed at what we have never used, they are suffering, they are suffering.
Some arrangements have been made in the destination of India and democracy has been created here.
There is also a need for deterioration in the social system.
The laws and regulations are also required and the rights and duties are also discussed.
But the dignitaries of India can proudly say that there is a version of democracy that has taken place on us more than law and order.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage, our tradition.
And we are the bigger brothers and sisters of the country.
Therefore, not for ourselves, but for the protection of democracy, the country had called for a complete election.
We have easily found the precious democracy that we have got in the house.
More than 61 crore people have voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
But if I ask for the world's direction, I tell you that if one leaves China then more people than any other country's population have lost their vote in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double.
More than the population of the entire Europe, there are overall voters in India.
We can imagine how large resources and human sacrifices are required to perform this election.
Millions of teachers, officials and employees have worked hard day and night to overcome the challenges.
About three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have taken responsibility for the success of the Democratic General.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laid the foundation stone for their hard work.
We can imagine how much of the total election was done.
All these bread had been wasted to ensure that a single voter should not be deprived of his vote, to ensure that all the eligible voters have the right to vote.
In remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, only a female voter was made a polling booth.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel for two-two days to reach the remotest place.
Besides this, there has been a talk of proudness in this election.
I extend my best wishes to the Election Commission and to every person involved in this election process and bow down to the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you all have heard from me many times that I am insisting on books or books.
We all can give books instead of flowers while welcoming.
After listening to this, people have started visiting several places and welcomed them.
Recently, I had visited a book titled Premchand's popular Kahaniya.
I liked this visit.
I couldn't get a long time, but during the journey I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
Premchand has portrayed the society in his stories, while reading it, the pictures of that period would have been created before our eyes.
Each penetration, every thing that he wrote, keeps alive.
Their stories seem to have included the spirit of overall India.
When he reads the story of Nasha, my heart was in the forefront of the economic inequality of the society.
I remembered my youth yesterday.
Our youths had been debated over the economic ties of the society overnight.
In this, the sensitivity of a child, the immense mothers in her mind, the maturity in her mind, the maturity in her thoughts in such a small age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to our lives in the fair, the true sense of human sensitivity reaches the peak, it will finally make the tired reader very emotional.
In this story, the live pictures of a poor farmer's life can be saved.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated in the very dense forest of Idukki.
Primary Teacher P.
Murlidharan and a small tea shopkeeper P.
V.
Both of them started the library with tireless hard work.
Once upon a time, both of them used to make books and books were used in their villages in the jungles on their backs.
Today, this library is working to show a new direction to everyone along with the tribal children.
His Gujarat Mission has succeeded in achieving success in Gujarat.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this campaign and they read books.
In today's digital era, during the time of Google Guru, I would like to urge you to keep a little time to save books in your daily work.
My dear countrymen, the people of our country not only consider the present time but also consider the future challenges.
When I was reading your reactions to the Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I remember that many people have written a lot about water problem.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, many others have written about the challenges related to water.
The water should be equal to mothers and the blessings of mothers and the blessings of the mother of the water shall remain upon us.
Due to the deficiency of water every year in many parts of the country there is misery .
We only save only eight percent of the water, so now it is necessary to solve this problem.
Just as we all have solved the problem of water from the people's participation and from the people's power, we will find answers with the help and determination of every one hundred and thirty crore countrymen.
Keeping this in mind that water is the most important, it has now become a new Ministry of Jal Shakti in the country.
This will enable quick decisions on all the topics related to water.
Just a few days ago, I tried to do something very fast.
I have written letters to the Sarpanches and the Gram Pradhans across the country.
In order to save water, to save water, to keep water storage, not drops of rain, to save rain water, the village heads should talk to the village council.
It has been decided to save every drop of water and save rain water in villages.
In today's Mann Ki Baat program, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
My best wishes to all the rural Prime Ministers and all the Sarpanches for the activism shown by them.
Several components across the country have made such a plan for water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
Therefore, the people of the village are now in competition to build water temples in their villages.
I have already said that if collective efforts are made, it will have great positive results.
There cannot be a single specific formula to address the water conservation across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But all the goals are the same and that is water saving, water conservation.
In Punjab, the work is being done to improve the drainage lines.
These tasks will solve the problem of water logging.
The lives of the people of the village are changing due to the construction of water tanks at Thimpalli in Telangana.
The small ponds built in the fields of Kabir Dham in Rajasthan have made a big change.
I was reading about the collective efforts made in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I am also aware that the women of Garhwal are working together in the work of water harvesting in a very good way.
I am confident that it was impossible when we work together and strive hard.
When everybody is involved in this water conservation, the water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have the pride of three things to the people of the country.
My first aim is to start a mass movement for water conservation as the people of the country have launched the Swachhta Mission.
We all resolve to save every drop of water and I am confident that water is the gift of Lord God.
Earlier, it was said that the touch of Paris was made of iron.
I say that water is sufficient and Paris means water touch creates a new life.
One awareness campaign should be started to save every drop of water.
Make the society aware and work to connect the society.
I urge you all to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of us had got the opportunity to go to Porbandar, then he would have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu.
Therefore, I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then you must see the water storage tank.
Let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and encourage people to save water.
We can share our information by using JanshaktiForjalShakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude for one more thing.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion of Yoga Day.
On that day, the whole world looked like a happy and happy family.
Therefore, the propagation of Yoga is a great task of social service.
So, don't you want to recognise those who do such service and defend them
In the year 2019, the Prime Minister's Award was announced for promoting Yoga and giving excellent contribution to development.
This is inspiring.
Now, if Yoga is going on, then Indians are not in this field.
Bihar Yoga University and Munger have also been honored with these institutions for the last few decades.
My dear countrymen, our journey is starting today, new emotions, new experiences, new resolves, new powers, but I will continue to wait for our challenges.
Come on, let us meet and talk.
I listen to your feelings and keep in mind.
Sometimes they try to live with that feeling.
Our blessings are similar.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again, I visit Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much for me.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
There has been a strong feeling of regret in the hearts of the people of the country after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the terrorist attack that took place in Pulwama.
The martyred Veer Jawan and his family are expressing condolences around.
Similarly, there is a strong feeling of resistance to this kind of terrorist violence in our hearts and in my hearts, the same spirit is inspired by the humanist groups across the globe to believe in the minds and humanity of every country.
I salute all the brave sons of the country to sacrifice their lives for the protection of India and Mother.
Our Armed Forces have always shown unique adventures and perspectives.
Where he has shown a wonderful potential to establish peace.
He has worked hard to respond to the attackers in their own language.
We must have seen how it was done within a hundred hours.
Ratan Thakur, the martyr of Bhagalpur in Bihar, has been inspired by his father Ram Niranjan Ji in such a tragic event.
We also send our second son to fight the enemy and we fight ourselves if needed.
The whole country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena Ji, the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has also decided to recruit one of his only children in the CRPF.
When the village of Gumla in Jharkhand reached the participants of Shahid Vijay Shoren, who was wrapped in the Tricolor, his executor said that we will also be filled with salvation.
The courage shown by these innocent children is the spirit of every young child in India today.
The same feeling is visible from the houses of our brave and powerful martyrs.
There is no exception for one of our brave martyrs that their family is not exception.
Whether it is the family of Hathma Vijay Maurya of Deoria or the father-in-law of the martyr Tilkaraj of Kangra or the six-year-old martyr Hemraj of the crores, the story of every family of Huthama Jawans is inspiring.
We will not need to look at the ancient events in history to know what it means.
These are moving examples in front of our eyes.
These examples are the source of inspiration for the bright future of India.
My dear countrymen, we have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for several years.
Therefore, it is natural for the people to have curiosity and curiosity in their minds.
Shri Yut Onkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka on the Narendra Modi App, has expressed his happiness over the completion of the National War Memorial, which is the National War Memorial.
This memorial is a place to describe the legend of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to make it an inspirational memorial in the country.
We decided to build a National Military Memorial and the direct work was also started.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, this National Military Memorial will be delivered to millions of people of our country.
The country will make a very small effort to lend the loans on us.
This new memorial has been built near the India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti Part, where the heart of Delhi is called.
I am confident that the countrymen will have such a sacred task to visit a pilgrimage.
This National Military Memorial is a symbol of thanks to the soldiers who sacrificed their best after Independence.
This memorial will showcase the indomitable courage of our Amar Sainiks.
The National Military Memorial concept is based on four central circles, from the birth of a soldier to the death of a martyr.
The light of Amar Chakra is a symbol of the martyr's immortality.
The defence cycle after this is reflecting security.
There are rows of dense trees in this cycle.
These trees are the symbols of the soldiers and are giving a message to the people of the country, each team is ready on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Anyone will come here to know about the bravery of these brave soldiers, when they will be safe, we will live, we will develop the country, therefore we will be able to know about our sacrifices to our country.
In the development of the country, our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces are not really possible in the words of great and invaluable contributions.
I am glad that we all should thank the men and women police personnel who are constantly working for our security.
I am confident that we will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Therefore, others will also be encouraged to visit this sacred place and they will also be eager to visit this sacred place.
On this occasion, when I was reading the reactions that I had received from you, I would like to pay my attention to the extremely dreadful response of Atis Mahopadhyay ji.
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had attacked Birsa Munda.
And Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshed Ji Tata on 3rd March.
Both have come from different family backgrounds, but both of them have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In Mann Ki Baat, Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata have been congratulated to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have brightened the name of not only Jharkhand but also the entire country.
The entire country is grateful to him for his contribution.
Today, if our youngsters can be named as inspirational personalities, then they are Lord Birsa Munda.
When the British had slept Birsa Munda, they were completely hiding and snatched.
Do you know why the British had to accept such a way to catch Munda
Because they were afraid of Englishman Munda, who had created a very big empire.
Lord Birsa Munda, with the help of his traditional blessings, was completely destroyed by guns and the British government decorated with artillery.
In fact, if people get such an inspirational leadership then the collective willpower is stronger than the strength of the enemy towards the front.
Lord Birsa Munda not only confronted the British with political freedom but also fought for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
He showed everything in his lifestyle.
The blind life of the deprived and exploited has brought light like the rays.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed the age of 25 years.
The sons of Bharat Mata like Birsa Munda have taken place every part of the country.
But fortunately, the story of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice of these great people has not reached the new generation.
If the personality like Lord Birsa Munda gave us the feeling of existence, then the personality like Jamshedji Tata created large institutions in the country.
For a bright future, India is essential for science, technology and industry to become a hub.
Not only this, he also established several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekanand ji had once visited the ship during their visit to the US.
The foundation stone was laid by the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai Desai was born on 29th February.
We all know that this record comes only once in four years.
Morarji Bhai, a simple, peaceful personality, was one of the most distinguished leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is also in the name of the Parliament for the first time in independent India.
During that difficult period, Morarji Desai led Indias talented leadership.
Morarjibhai Desai blew himself up in the movement that started in protest against the invasion of democracy.
He had to pay a huge price in the old age.
During that period, the government used to attack them and put them in Turunga.
When Janta Party won the elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
Accordingly, it is clear that the fundamental rights obtained under the section 20 and 21 of the deficit will not be violated even during the time of revival.
This incident was revised by Morarji Bhai in order to repeat the way democracy was killed in 1975.
Today, once again I pay my tribute to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of enthusiasm among the people about Padma Awards.
In such a situation, we feel that those who work in a sense of selflessness, they and those who work hard for the people.
Many people are making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways by doing their hard work.
The people who are working freely in the public service, social service and the largest of these nations are compelling.
He is a true worker and is far away from the world of glittering.
He believes in the work. Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam is a direct message of the song.
I want to talk to you about some such people today.
Khattar is doing the job of reaching a new generation with rare paintings.
The art work done by Abdul Ghafoor was done by me in the form of a visit to the former US President Barack Obama.
Among the standards of Padma awards Shabbir of Marathwada is known as the servant of Said Gomata .
The way he has dedicated your entire life to the service of Mother Goddess, his work is different.
Even after the age of centuries, many people of the world are training Yoga.
So far, he has made one and a half thousand people a Yoga teacher and Jamuna Tudu, popularly known as Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has worked hard to handle two timber mafia and naxalites, not only to save 50 hectares of forests from extinction.
Just because of the hard work of Jamunabai ji, the people of that area now plant 18 trees after the birth of every child in their house.
He has worked towards how women empowerment and farming can benefit.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women in their respective areas to become financially self-reliant by connecting themselves with the Self Help Groups.
It can be said that this change in the list of award winners is a new image of India which is changing in a way.
My dear countrymen, the experience of a heart has come to me just recently, it will tell us here today.
Today, wherever I go in the country, I am trying to meet some beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PMJAY, that is, I am trying to get the opportunity to talk to them.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I am aware that this scheme has brought about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If a poor person is not able to afford affordable medical treatment, then we all must give information about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the season of examinations in schools is going to start now.
The examinations of the tenth and twelfth will start in the next few weeks.
My heartiest congratulations to all the students and the parents and all the teachers.
Just a few days back, a big program like Pariksha Pe Church was organised in Delhi.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on various topics related to the exam.
This will benefit the students, he added.
All students, their teachers and parents can see the entire recording of the programme on YouTube and my best wishes to all the test fighters for the forthcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, there is a discussion on India and there is no talk of festivals or festivals.
This is because we have a thousand years old culture and tradition that benefited us.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I had got the opportunity to spend some time with the Divyang brothers and sisters in this visit to Kashi.
And it was very surprising to hear the words for me, Naval.
Just as I speak in Mann Ki Baat, those disabled youths have been able to imitate the same way.
I am very convinced that people listen to the words of Mann Ki Baat.
I was really very impressed by the power of that disabled young man.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you through the Mann Ki Baat programme is an aggravated experience for me.
Through radio, I interact with millions of families every month in a way.
Many times while talking to all of us, while reading the letters we sent or listening to the thoughts that we have expressed on the phone, I feel that we all have accepted me as a member of our family.
This is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Electronics is the biggest festival of democracy.
In the next two months, we are busy with all the elections.
I myself am also an expert in this election.
After this, the Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday of May.
This means that the month of March, the month of April and the month of the whole month will go up.
After selecting all our feelings in this period, a new belief and the strength of the blessings of all of us will once again start a programme to interact with us through Mann Ki Baat and will continue to talk to us for many years.
Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shiv Kumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us that Kayakve Kailas means to live in Kailash Dham, the residence of Lord Shiva.
He was a well-known scholar who had wonderful significance on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He used to demonstrate that your entire life would get food, hospitality, education and spiritual knowledge.
Many times I have been fortunate to receive the blessings of the goddess.
In 2007, our dignitaries, Dr.
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem for the revered Swami Ji.
The poem of En Giving, Your Receive Happiness AllMyTill Blace, All Your Actions, Dr. Kalam Saheb, presents the life and the mission of Siddhaganga Monastery in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I pay my tributes to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy - I am talking about the Indian Election Commission.
On 25th January, the Election Commission was organised, which is celebrated as National Voters Day, the people of the world are surprised to see the huge level of elections being held in India and it is natural for each countrymen to respect the selectiveness of their talents.
Every citizen of India, who is a registered voter in our country.
The registered voter will get an opportunity to vote. No stone unturned to solve it.
In Himachal Pradesh, even at a height of 15,000 feet from the sea level, the polling stations are being started, while we listen to it, even on extremely remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Just imagine, for a voter.
When it comes to hearing this, it is natural to respect the election commission.
This is the beauty of our democracy, keeping in mind a voter who can get the opportunity to use his vote.
I appreciate the election commission that is constantly trying to strengthen our democracy.
I would like to tell the younger generation that if they are eligible to vote, they must register as voters.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote, the spirit should be reflected in itself.
We need to realize this responsibility.
This should be our commitment, our commitment.
This should be our culture.
I urge the country's noble person to register a vote together or make people aware by running a mission to vote.
I am confident that a large number of young voters will be registered and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some unique and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is multi-pronged.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was one of the great men.
On 23rd January, the whole country celebrated their birth anniversary with a different kind of tradition.
On Netajis Jayanti, I was fortunate to inaugurate the museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the freedom struggle of India.
We know that many rooms and buildings were closed in the Red Fort since Independence.
The Museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army is now in a very beautiful museum.
The Museum dedicated to Yad-e-Jaliyan and 1857 ATTEN Philippines, India, First War of Independence and the entire campus is dedicated to the nation as Shanti Mandir.
In each of these museums, there is a fragrance of our glorious history.
The museum inspires us to look at the story of the heroes of our freedom struggle.
At this very place, BRITISH Rajvati was flagged off by Bharat Mata's Veer Suputra-Connel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I visited the Red Fort, in the Kranti temple, the memories associated with Netaji, the members of Netaji's family visited me a very special cap cap cap cap.
Netaji used to wear that hat.
I let the hat be kept in the museum so that the people coming there can see the hat and inspire the people of the country.
In fact, our brilliance and patriotism need to be consistently transformed into different forms till the new generation.
A month ago, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
The tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is a tradition of August 15.
75 years have been completed since the formation of Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave young and skilled association.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the struggle for freedom.
Let's go to Delhi. Let me eat, I will give you freedom, Netaji won the hearts of every Indian by giving a bright announcement.
And I am glad that we have been able to do this thing for several years.
I remember the entire family of Netaji who had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
We all together conveyed condolences on several aspects related to Netaji and paid tribute to Netaji Subhash Bose.
I am glad that many places related to the great heroes of India have been trying to develop in Delhi.
Be it 26 Alipur Road related to Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If we come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that is the news of Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
Similarly, the leaders were also very close to radio and they also chose the same medium to interact with the people of the country.
In 1942, Subhash Babu launched Azad Hind Radio and interacted with the soldiers and people of Azad Hind Fauj through radio.
Subhas Babu had a different style of starting a conversation on radio.
At the beginning of the conversation, he used to say, "Dis Is Subhas Chandra Bose Speaking to You Over the Azad Hind Radio" and as soon as he heard it, a new zeal, a new energy was circulated in the sages.
I was told that these radio stations were broadcasting weekly news that were given in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu.
The residents of Gujarat, M.
Vyas played a very important role.
The programmes to be broadcast from Azad Hind Radio were very popular amongst the common people and their programme gave great strength to the fighters of our freedom struggle.
A painting museum has been built in the same Kranti temple .
There has been an attempt to present Indian art and culture in an extremely attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 centuries old paintings and artworks are there.
Excellent art works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avindranath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Saloz Mukherjee etc. are exhibited in the museum.
And I would like to urge all of you to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that there is a discussion of art here and I am telling you about the best artwork of Gurudev Tagore.
So far, we are calling Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore a writer and a musician.
But I want to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on several topics.
They have also depicted pictures of animals and birds, they have also depicted many beautiful natural scenes and they have not only worked to depict many human characters on the canvas through art.
And the special thing is that he has not given some names to most of his pictures.
He believed that his painting seeker himself would understand the meaning of the paintings and his message from the paintings would be understood from his perspective.
His paintings have also been exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I am confident that we will definitely visit the Kranti temple to see their paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed their message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give a big message to bigger people.
He said that Haizo Ketan's brother-in-law does not get involved even if the bananas are swallowed, then there is nothing left below the leaf, but the entire trees come to an end, just like that the human being has lost different species and human beings are not there.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every person, then it is not right to walk on the basis of religion and social basis.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Saint Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labor throughout his life through his message.
It would not be wrong to say here that he told the world the true meaning of the talent of labour.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I will highlight Indias space programme and its future-related aspects.
He said that I would like to urge the students to take juice in the space programme and take a different look forward to going beyond the sky.
A few days back, I was in Ahmedabad when I had the privilege to unveil the statues of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has played an important role in Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
Today, we are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching space.
On 24th January, our students have made the Kalam-Set lunch.
Sounding rockets made by students from University in Odisha have established several records.
As far as space missions have taken place since Independence to 2014, almost the same space missions have been started in the last four years.
We have also made a global record to release 104 satellites from one spacecraft.
We will soon showcase Indias presence on the Moon through the Chandrayaan-2 Mission.
Our country is using space technology in a better way to protect live and wealth.
Whether it is a cyclone or rail and road safety, all of these are helping the space technology.
Our fishermen have been given navigational devices, which are also helpful in economic advancement along with their safety.
We are using space technology to further enhance government services and responsibilities.
About 40 lakh houses have been set up in 23 states in the housing for All.
Besides, around three and a half crore merchandise under MNREGA has also been joy tagged.
Today, our satellites have become a symbol of the growing strength of the country.
Our best relations with many countries of the world have been enhanced.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also gifted development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through our extremely competitive launch service, India is launching the satellites of not only developing countries but also developing countries.
The sky and stars are always very attractive for the children .
Our space programme provides opportunities to the children to move forward by thinking differently.
Our children are looking at the stars and we have a perspective to find and motivate new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the sportsperson will open and many young and young sportspersons have come out in India.
About 6,000 sportspersons participated in the Khelo India Youth Sports Competition in Pune in January.
When the sportsperson will perform the best at the local level, he will perform the best globally.
On this occasion, players from every State in Khelo India have performed well at their own level.
Several medal winners are encouraging their lives.
He lives in a parking lot with his family.
The captain of the 21-year-old Women's Kabdadi Union of Maharashtra, Sonali Helvey Satara, is a resident of Satara. Her younger brother and her brother encouraged the skills of Sonali.
It has always been seen that in the games like Kabbadi, women are not encouraged.
Yet, Sonalin chose Kabbadi and performed excellently.
10-year-old Abhinav Shaw of Asansol is the youngest Gold medal winner of Khelo India Youth Sports.
Akshata Baswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won the Gold medal at Han Weightlifting.
They are farmers in Belgaum.
When we talk of building a New India, the idea of Young Power is a New India.
These tales of Khelo India are telling that not only big cities, small towns, villages, towns, young people, young people, young sports talents, but also have a great contribution in the creation of a New India.
My dear countrymen, we must have heard about several prestigious beauty contents.
The name is Swachh Sundarban Toilet.
People keep their toilets clean and make them beautiful by making some paintings, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup, pictures of clean beautiful toilets will also be seen on social media.
I urge all the Sarpanchs and the village heads to undertake this mission in their Panchayat.
Definitely put a picture of your clean beautiful toilets on social media with Milzatghar.
Friends, On 2nd October, 2014, we started a journey that will keep in mind all together to free the country from clean and open defecation.
Today, the collaborations of every citizen of India are moving towards open defecation, long before 2nd October, 2019, to pay homage to the fathers for their 150th birth anniversary.
Ankul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about the test and testing warriors.
Angul ji, thank you for presenting this issue.
The first part of the year is seasonal for many tests.
Students, their parents and teachers are busy in the work related to the examinations.
I extend my best wishes to all students, their parents and teachers.
Today, I would have liked discussions in this programme of Mann Ki Baat, but you would be happy to hear that after two days, I will interact with the students from across the country from the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme on 29th January, 2019.
And many foreign students will also participate in the event.
Some of these ideas and information will definitely be placed before you in the Town Hall programme.
Through social media and Namo, we can also see the same lifespan.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the whole country pays tributes to the martyrs.
We also pay tribute to the martyrdom for two minutes.
My best wishes and thanks to all of you.
The year 2018 will end.
And that is why experiences are benefitted and self-confidence is created to choose.
What can we do so that we can transform our lives and the society and the country can contribute further.
Many congratulations to all of you for the year 2019.
You all will be determined to keep any memory of 2018.
It is also important that in 2018, India will be remembered as a country and it will be remembered as a strength of our 1.
And we are also proud to fill the tire with dignity.
The Health Vima Yojana, the worlds largest Ayushman Bharat, was launched in 2018.
Vegetables have reached every bay of the country.
The prestigious institutions of the world have accepted that India is rapidly working towards poverty eradication.
With the immense determination of the countrymen, cleanliness is progressing towards 95.

Our collective efforts have resulted in an unprecedented increase in Indias trade ease.

This has resulted in the introduction of revolution in waterways.
The country's longest rail-road bridge was inaugurated and the 100th Pakyong airport of Sikkim was inaugurated.
India has also won the World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup in 19 years.
This year, India has earned a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India also performed well in the Para Asian Strategy.
If I have been talking about our collective efforts for the sake of every Indian, then our Mann Ki Baat will be so far that 2019 will shine.
All this has been possible only by the efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we have met some strange Indians in this December.
On December 19, Dr.
Dr. Jayendran is known as the cheapest treatment provider for the poor.
People say that he was ready to serve the patients.
I have read several records about the work that inspires his society at this indicator.
Similarly, on 25th December, Sulagitinarsamma, Karnataka was funded.
Earlier this year, he was honored with the Padma Shri.
There are many people like Jaichandran and Sulagiti Narasamy who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of society.
If we talk about healthcare, then I would like to talk about the social efforts made by the doctors of Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors from the city provide free treatment to the poor by organizing camps.
The heart long cretical care of this place is taken every month and there is a facility of free treatment for many diseases in this camp.
Today hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps every month .
The enthusiasm of these young doctors who are serving patients with selflessness is really worth watching .
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has succeeded due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh had launched Swachhta Abhiyan.
I'm just the tebeterindia.
I am confident that this will provide more and more information about our transformational transformation in society.
It is easier to spread negativeness.
But there are many good things happening around us in the society.
And all this is happening with the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is one of the most important in every society.
When the sportspersons are played, they also get energy in the minds of those who see them.
We are witnessing many things like sportspersons' fame, identity and respect.
But there are many things that are more than the world, bigger than the world.
I would like to tell you about Kashmir's Kanya Hanya Nisar, who won the Gold medal at the Karate Excellencies in Korea.
Hanya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hanya practiced and practiced Karate by Mehnat and Chicati and learned the barracks and proved themselves.
I pray to all the people of the country for their bright future.
Many greetings and blessings to Hanya.
Similarly, the 16-year-old Rajni girl had a lot of discussion in the media.
Rajan said that his father had done a lot of sacrifice to reach here.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning before Rajini and his passion.
When Rajan expressed his desire to learn foolishness, his parents collected all possible resources and encouraged him.
Rajini had to use old gloves for the sake of foolishness because the financial condition of her family was highlighted.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajini didn't go dragging and taught the foolishness.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh Ji and Usha Rani for helping Rajini and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian cycling in the world.
He used to run around 300 kilometres of cycle daily for 159 days.
You can imagine 300 kms of cycling everyday
Its responsibility for driving a cycle is truly a testimony.
Whether we are inspired to hear such a success or not.
Especially when my young friends listen to such events, they also get inspiration to do something by crossing the obstacles.
If it is determined, if there is strength in the determination then all the problems fall on their own.
No problem can be a hindrance.
When we listen to such examples, we also get inspiration every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, there will be many festivals like Love, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magha Bihu, Maghi in January.
On the occasion of all these festivals the color of traditional dances will be seen somewhere in Sonorama and somewhere the iron ore will be burnt in the pleasure of Sugi .
After this the day starts increasing gradually and the season of winters starts .
Many congratulations to the farmers of our foodgrains.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is an integral part of our festivals.
We can see how much of our festivals have been associated with nature.
Social and nature are not different in Indian culture, but individuals and integrity are the same.
The best example of our close relationships with nature is the calendar based on societies.
In this, not only the year's festival but also the knowledge of the planets and the planets.
Through these traditional calendars we find out how old our relationship with natural and geographical events is .
As per the speed of the moon and the sun, the moons are fixed according to the moon and suncalendar.
Which depends on the calendar which calendars calendars .
In many areas, festivals are also celebrated according to the conditions of the Nakshatras.
All these festivals are celebrated according to the lunar calendar, Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakhi, Bihu.
In many of our festivals, river and water conservation has a special significance.
Chhath is a celebration of sunset in rivers and lakes.
Millions and crores of people also take bath in the sacred rivers on Makar Sankranti .
Our festivals also teach us social problems.
On the one hand, it has a mythological significance and on the other hand, every festival is easier to inspire social brotherhood.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the year 2019 and wish you all the best.
My dear countrymen, there are many things in our culture that we can glorify and show the world with pride and one of these things is our Kumbh Mela.
People from all over the country come there and are always associated with the Kumbh festival.
In the Kumbh festival, the people of faith and devotion are decorated.
At one place, millions of people from the country and abroad have come together.
The tradition of the Kumbh festival has been fulfilled and blossomed from our great cultural heritage.
This year, from 15th January, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organized in Prayagraj, which you may be waiting eagerly.
For the Kumbh fair since now saints and women have started reaching Prayagraj .
Last year, UNESCO has placed Kumbh in the list of unique cultural traditions of humanity, which can imagine its global importance.
A few days back, the princes of several countries had come to see the preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
At that time several nations were flagged off at the same time.
There is a possibility of more than 150 people coming to the Kumbh Mela held in Prayagraj.
The divineness of the Kumbh will enhance India's diversity in the entire world.
The Kumbh Mela is an effective medium to find itself and every person coming here feels different.
This is a very big academic experience especially for the youth.
I myself had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh Mela are going on in a very concerted manner.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh.
This year, cleanliness is also being emphasized in the Kumbh Mela.
If you take care of cleanliness in the Kumbh event, then its good message will reach far away.
This year Bhavik Triveni will also be able to pay homage to Akshayavata after the holy bath at Sangam.
This impulse, which symbolizes the beliefs of the devotees, had been closed in a fort for many years, so even if it wanted, the emotions could not see it.
But now the forts of this Akshayvat have been opened for all.
I would like to appeal to you that when you visit the Kumbh festival, you must upload some photos of the Kumbh on social media showing different colors, you will get inspiration from more and more people to visit this Kumbh.
This Kumbh of spirituality should be the great Kumbh of philosophy for Indians.
Become this Kumbh of art, the Mahakumbh of creativity.
My dear countrymen, all our countrymen are very excited about the functions of the Republic Day of January 26.
There is an unprecedented relationship between Puja Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan became Mahatma from South Africa.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood firmly in opposition to description.
He also established Finics and Tolstoy Farms, from where voices were raised for peace and justice throughout the world.
2018 is also celebrated as the centenary year of Nelson Mande, which is also known as Madiba.
It is surprising to all of you that Nelson Mande is considered to be an ideal for the fight against discrimination all over the world.
He had the power to absorb Turungawas for so many years and inspiration from respectable Bapu.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mande are not only inspirations for the entire world but also encourages us to create a society full of ideals, love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days back, a DGP conference was held at Kevdia on Narmada coast in Gujarat, where the world's highest statue is Statue of Unity.
There was a comprehensive discussion on how steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the country.
At the same time, I announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Integration and the award will be honoured to those who contribute to national unity in any way.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He has always been trying to defy India's integrity.
Sardar Patel believed that the true strength of India is incorporated in the diversity of this region.
Honouring his feelings and paying tributes to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, 13th January is the sacred day of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, for a long time North India was his workplace and he died in Nanded in Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi Patna, Karmabhoomi North India and the end of life in Nanded.
Similarly, in a sense, the whole of India received his blessings.
If we look at their lives then we can see the reflections of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of Pita Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji got the post of Guru in the nine years of Alpuz.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji got the courage to fight for justice in the form of a heritage from Guru.
Their personality was calm and straight, but whenever an attempt was made to smile the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh fought hard for the poor and the weak every time...
I used to say that one hundred and a half million boys, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspers
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that this is the biggest service to overcome human sufferings.
He was an excellent tricolor, and he was proud of many other languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Farshi, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again congratulate Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things happening in the country which are not discussed at large.
I mean, Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority.
I have been working to promote the safe and healthy habits of food.
India will be prosperous only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritious food is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, F.
I congratulate him on this initiative taken by him.
I urge you all to join this programme.
I would like to say that we should also participate in this and especially the children should show these things.
It is important to get education that tells the importance of food from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of the year 2018 and we will meet again in the year 2019.
Whether it is a person or a nation or a society, the inspiration is the foundation for the progress of that life.
Let us move ahead with such inspiration, new enthusiasm, new resolves, new accomplishments and new heights, change ourselves and change the country.
On 3rd October, 2014, on the auspicious occasion of Vijaya Dashmi, we all started a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
One person was a dhaba driver.
There is no clothing for drums.
On the sides of the road, he had made a small hat like contract.
At that time, discussions were started on radio.
In the remotest part of the country, from the entire village to the metro cities, from the farming dams to the young businessmen, it has to be reached.
Recently, Akashvani has also made a survey of Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen the implications of the survey, some of the implications are very different, careful.
About 70 percent of the people who have been surveyed are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people are very much contributing towards enhancing positive spirit in society.
This is a glimpse of the positive sentiment that is present in the minds of our countrymen.
Many people have also learned that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of doing something by voluntarily and voluntarily.
There has been a change that people are coming forward with great enthusiasm for social service.
I am happy to see that the radio is growing more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
But in this journey only radio has not been the same medium.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
The doubt that we have made is exactly the same.
If a leader has been given a mike to speak and if he has laid down millions of crores of rupees to listen to him then what would be more
The words which have been used repeatedly, have been practiced.
The researchers have concluded that this programme is not related to the politics, when I started the Mann Ki Baat programme, I was sure that I didn't want to make a decision in this regard.
I am inspired by you that you have done the hard work to prove my determination.
It was clear from the leaflets that came before every part of the Mann Ki Baat, what are the benefits of the leaflets from online tips.
Modi will come and go but this country will remain intact and our culture will remain incomplete.
130 crore Indians will continue to live in these small things.
Anyone from a remote corner of the country writes letters to me that people should not be very much dealt with with small shopkeepers like us, auto-rickshaw drivers, vegetable sellers.
Now a scheme like Selfie With Doter can be started in a small village in Haryana, not only in the entire country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government statement.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
The question that we have asked is to give a straight answer in a simple word.
The actual Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Because every time before Mann Ki Baat, I get letters from the people.
By calling this number, people also record their messages in their voices.
Before every part of the Mann Ki Baat, we are trying to save maximum number of letters and tips.
Every moment my countrymen have been doing houses in my heart and that is why whenever I read a letter, the situation and feelings of that writer become part of my thoughts.
In such a situation, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
It is my voice in Mann Ki Baat, but all the examples, sentiments and inspirations are from my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people who have not been named in Mann Ki Baat till date, but these people send their letters.
The letters which cannot be placed in Mann Ki Baat are also tried by the concerned departments to take care of all those letters and their suggestions.
With his hard work, Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
A team of Akashwani prepares each part for spreading in different languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages spoken in style.
In a way, he becomes Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I congratulate them and thank them for their princely state and their efforts to showcase them.
I urge all of you to listen to this programme in our local language.
But many of the subjects discussed in Mann Ki Baat were also raised by the media.
There are several topics like Swachhta, Road Safety, Ambulance Free India, Selfie with Doctors, on these topics, the media has created innovative ideas and made it a campaign and worked a lot further in that field.
Without our cooperation, the journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Sometimes our ancestors also stand like a big crisis in communication.
Besides acceptance and procedures, I am giving priority to understand what the person is saying.
Generally, the Communication Gap was always discussed between the elderly, the elderly, the elderly, and the daughters of Kumar Vyogatali.
In fact, it is also limited to discussing between Kumaravyin children and children in most houses.
In this, there was a discussion on the practices of children or their habits as well as the living conditions of their present.
I am always trying to learn from them what they are doing or how they think.
In fact, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I say - What's wrong with this
These youngsters have shown the courage to ask questions and to see the greatest dreams, the same youngsters have made this change.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vineeta Ji has written on 'MyGov' that I should talk about 'Samvidha Din' that is, 'Rajya Ghatna Din' in Mann Ki Baat tomorrow, on 26th November.
He said that this day is very special because we accepted the Constitution, it is now 69 years old and it will enter the 70th year.
Imagine that within three years, these great personalities have created such a comprehensive and comprehensive event.
The way these great people have created such a pace of deterioration, this is an excellent example of school management and productivity.
The special thing in our state-of-the-art framework is that the rights and duties have been detailed in detail.
Both of them are going to move forward in the lives of the citizens.
If we respect and respect the rights of others then our rights will be protected automatically and even if we follow our duties in the Constitution, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember Changlanch that the people of India had 60 years of age, while in 2010 we had taken a glorious decoration tour by putting an elephant on the elephant in Gujarat.
We recall our efforts to create awareness about the state-of-the-art constitution and to inform them about the important aspects of the state-of-the-art structure.
And, in our country, we must ensure that Peace, Progress, Prosperity, Peace, Prosperity and Prosperity Nandel.
My dear countrymen, when the Rajya Sabha is discussed, we can never forget the contribution of the great man.
He was a great man, a pious Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar
His Excellency on 6th December is the Republic Day.
What happens to democracy and how parliamentary systems are there is nothing new for India.
He said that this freedom that we have achieved after such a struggle is invaluable and we have to protect our blood drops.
India First Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on November 23, we all celebrated Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and in the next year, we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He has always shown the path of truth, action, service, compassion and compassion to society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been instructed to celebrate this program in a big way.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the globe.
At that time I remember Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, there was a huge loss of the culprit.
But in collaboration with the local people, the manner in which the state government has worked for the resumption of this crime is still an ideal thing.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that the tourists of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
But this journey will continue.
The more people connected with us, our journey will be better and the more pleasant ones.
Sometimes the question arises in the minds of the people, what do I get due to Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the leader of all of us, and like every year, the youngsters of the country are eager to run for the Run for Unity.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this race to listen in large numbers.
About six months before Independence, on 27th January, 1947, the timings of the world's famous International Month 'Time' were published by Sardar Patel on his verse.
This was a map of India which was divided into several parts.
There were more than 550 institutions in the country.
Even though the juice of the British of India had been finished, they used to break this country in many parts and then leave the country.
The Times were writing that the threats like deployment, violence, inflation, inflation, and power politics are enormous.
He added that if anyone has the ability to snatch the country into the dust of hearing and to fill the wounds, they are Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This timing of the Time month was going to open several other aspects of the life of Iron Man.
After the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s, how he made arrangements for rescue work, how he directed the Bardoli Satyagraha.
He has merged all institutions in India.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Trivancore or Rajasthan's Rajvati-Sardar Patels ideological maturity and strategic skills, we can see the same India today.
We recall Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by looking at this nation that was built in the bondage of hearing.
The festival of Sardar Patel, which will be celebrated on 31st October, will be even more special. On that day, we will dedicate the earliest effigy to the Statute of Unity to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel.
The height of this puppet built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty puppet in America.
This effigy is the highest effigy of the world.
Every Indian will now be proud of the fact that the highest effigy in the world is in the Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, who had a relationship with the land, will now enhance the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when the Indian soldiers landed on the soil of Kashmir and protected the skull from the horsemen.
This historical destination is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading in an old sentence of Sam Manikshaw, the great Indian lecturer.
During that period, Field Marshal Manikshaw used to remind him of the time of his current career.
On 31st October is also the death anniversary of our Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Honourable tributes to Indira Ji.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are very important in the world of sports.
The country's youngsters have these qualities, not only will the country progress in areas like economies, science and technology, but also in sports.
Our Para Athletes attended the Asian Para Games 2018.
In this competition, India has generated a total of 72 medals and created a new record and promoted Indias honour.
I am fortunate to meet all these talented Para Athletes individually and congratulate them.
Similarly, there was a chance to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You will be happy to note that in Youth Olympics 2018, our youngsters have done the best job so far.
In addition to 13 medals, we have achieved three more medals in Mix types.
We must remember that India's performance in the Asian Games of Yeda was also good.
See how many times I used the best and most glorious words for a few minutes.
This is the story of Indian sportspersons who are reaching new heights every day.
India is not only in sports but also in those areas which have never been considered.
For example, I want to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who won gold medals in the Asian Para Games 2018 for the country.
They are disabled from birth.
When he was eight years old, he had a huge legacy.
And then it was eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving orphanage, he worked as a water to clean the DTC bus and to dwell on the roads of Delhi.
Today, the same Narayan is winning gold medals for India in international competitions.
Moreover, look at Indias best performance in sports, India has never won any Olympic medal in Judo.
But Tababi Devi won history by winning silver medals in Youth Olympics.
The 16-year-old young sportsperson Tababi Devi is a resident of a village in Manipur.
Their elders are labourers, while the mother works to sell fish.
Many times his family had such a time that they did not even have the money to eat.
In such a situation, the morale of Tababi Devi has not been lost.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable legends.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young player and his responsibility is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organised the FIFA-17 World Cup in 2017.
The entire world appreciated him for taking a very successful sports event.
A new record was created in the FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup regarding the number of viewers.
More than 12 lakh people in different stadiums of the country enjoyed football and encouraged young sportspersons.
India is fortunate to organize a Men Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar this year.
The Hockey World Cup will start in November 2018 and will run till 16th December.
Every Indian is playing any game or playing any juice, he has a selfishness in his mind towards Hockey.
The history of India in Hockey has been written with gold.
Earlier, India had won gold medals in many competitions and once India has also been a world crew winner.
India has also given Hockey many great players.
When Hockey is discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is known all over the world.
After that, Hawk has taken a big journey from Balvinder Singh Siniyar, Leslie Glodius, Mohammed Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pilla.
Even today, Team Indias players are inspiring the new generation of Hockey with the success of their hard work and devotion.
There is a good opportunity to see a thrilling face for sports lovers .
He will visit Bhubaneswar and encourage not only Indians but also other organizations.
Along with enjoying the sports you can also see the sun temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath temple in Puri and many world famous and sacred places along with Chilka lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men Hockey Federation for this competition and the 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with them and supporting them.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the federations of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kind of people coming forward for social work is inspiring and enthusiastic for all the countrymen.
But in a new era, in a new way, in a new generation, in a new way, in a new hope, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way.
Just a few days back, I had visited a programme where a portal has been started. The name is Self-For Societies, MyGov and the IT and electronic industry of the country encouraged their employees to provide such opportunities for social activities.
Every Indian will be proud of the enthusiasm and intimacy he has for this work.
IT to society, I am not, I am not, I am not, I am not aged, I am smelling about the journey of Samasti.
If anybody is teaching children, somebody is teaching the senior citizens, somebody is engaged in the work of cleanliness, somebody helps the farmers and there is a selfless feeling of dedication and determination.
A young man himself learned Wheelchair Basketball to help the Wheelchair Basketball Association of the Disabled.
This is the spirit, dedication, this is the initiative which has been done for special purposes.
Do not any Indian feel proud of this
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was watching the news of people for Mann Ki Baat, I got to see a charming tip from Puducherry to Shri Manish Mahapatra.
He has written on MyGov, Please say that in Mann Ki Baat, the customs and traditions of many of the people of India are the best examples of co-existence with nature.
We need to acknowledge their traditions in our lives and teach them something.
My best wishes to the people of Mann Ki Baat for their best wishes.
This is a matter that inspires us to look at our glorious history and culture. Today, the entire world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for balanced lifestyle.
However, our country is not free from this problem, but we have to take our insight into it, our rich history, tradition and especially the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Keeping an agreement with nature has been part of our tribal culture.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like Goddesses.
In the Bhil tribal communities of Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship pimples and Arjuna.
In the desert of Rajasthan, the world community has shown us the path of environmental protection.
Especially for the protection of trees, it is permissible for them to sacrifice their lives but it is not for them to harm one tree.
In Arunachal Pradesh, Mishmi claims to have a relationship with the tigers.
They also consider them brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland tigers are seen as the protector of forests .
The people of the Varali community of Maharashtra consider the tiger as tigers and their existence is a prosperity for them.
It is a belief in the people of Central India that their own fate is connected to the tiger, if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will have to be hungry.
During the reproductive season of Gond tribal fish in Central India, fishing is closed in some parts of the Kethan river.
On the Nilgiri Plateau in south India, a small furnace community is broken and traditionally their settlements are made from locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that tribal communities are filled with peaceful and compassionate compassion, but if someone harms their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for our rights.
Our first freedom fighters belonged to the tribal community, it is no surprise.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who made a strong fight against the British government to protect our wild land.
My dear countrymen, in my heart, we talk about those people and institutions who have done some unparalleled work for the society.
But in reality, they have a deep impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of society.
Just a few days back, I used to read about the farmers of Punjab, Bhai Gurbachan Singh.
A common and hard worked farmer was married to the son of Gurbachan Singh Ji.
Before marriage, Gurubachan ji said that we are going to marry the bride's mother Vadla in a simple manner.
There will be more and more things, there is no need to spend more.
We have to celebrate this occasion in a simple manner.
But he said suddenly, but I am a fool.
Nowadays, when there is a topic of weddings, it is common to seem that there is a big demand in front of the bride's family that will be difficult for the bride's family.
But you will be surprised to know that this was Bhai Gurbachan Singh, a straightforward farmer and what he said is the true strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji said, Let me promise that we will never burn in our fields.
We can imagine how much social power is there in it.
But we have seen how huge their personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform their personal context into social interests.
The family of Shriman Gurbachan Singh ji has made such an example before us.
I have lived in another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near Nab.
It is a matter of discussion that instead of burning cereals, they melt and melt in soil and the technology that should be used for it.
Brothers and sisters, Gurbachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to all those who are making best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You are moving ahead with the Indian tradition of strong lifestyle as a true heritage.
Small activism and awareness and positive activity play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, our texts have said: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Smt.
In life, in heart, in me, in you, in every corner of the world, peace establishes everywhere.
Peace: Peace: Whenever there is a discussion of world peace then India's name and contribution will be seen brightening in golden sight.
There is a special significance for India on 11th November because the first war ended 100 years ago on 11th November.
The destructions are finishing 100 years, that is, a century will be fulfilled by the massive destruction and human destruction of that period.
The First War for India was an important event.
In fact, we have nothing to do with that war directly.
Yet, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role, gave the highest sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when wars were there, they were not less than anybody.
Our soldiers have shown valour in remote areas and opposite situations.
This was one of the objectives - the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world saw all the destructions.
As per the estimate, about one crore soldiers and so many civilians lost their lives.
With this, all the world understood the importance of peace.
In the last 100 years, the description of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony does not mean just war.
There is a need to work with global cooperation and coordination for terrorism to climate change, economic development and social justice.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true reflection of peace.
My dear countrymen, the story of our North-Eastern India is different.
The natural beauty of the North-East is incomparable and the people here are extremely talented .
Our North-East India is known for the best work.
North-East India is a region that has made immense progress in organic farming.
A few days back Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award for 2018 to promote sustainable food processing.
The award is given by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) associated with the United Nations.
You will be happy to note that this award will be given to make the best policy in the region along with Oscars.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for taking up this award by putting back 51 nominally benefitted policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is over.
There is a huge change in the weather.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for these festivals.
I invite you to take care of yourself during these festivals, take care of your health and also take care of society.
This festival is an opportunity to take new decisions.
This decision was taken in a mission mode and it would be an opportunity for us to make a strong determination.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The more your progress will be the progress of the country.
