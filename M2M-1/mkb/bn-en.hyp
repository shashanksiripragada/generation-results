Mann Ki Baat October, 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
We have been told that you all have a lot of good wishes for Deepawali.
Deepajotirnmost in the enemy's destruction.
It's so beautiful.
Deepawali is currently celebrated in different countries of the world.
Not only Indians are involved in this festival, but the governments of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that country celebrate Deepawali Festival with Harsha Ullas.
There is a kind of India.
Friends, Festivals are a different attraction for tourism in the world.
Our India is a country of festivals and there is a huge opportunity for tourism.
We should try to promote all these festivals like Holi, Deepawali, Vanam, Pongal, Bihu, and join other states and people of other countries.
There are so many festivals in every state and every region of our country that people of other countries are interested in these festivals.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in improving tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I had decided to do something different on the occasion of Diwali.
I said, Come, let us all celebrate the achievements of Indian women and their achievements in this Deepawali.
Just after seeing this, there is a lot of inspiring stories in the SYSAL media.
Varengal's Kodipaka Ramesh, Namo App says, "My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we're five brothers in a good life.
My mother is my God.
Everything of myself, he is a Lakshmi of India.
Ramesh ji, my greetings to your mother.
Active lyricist Swami, who was the daughter of Bus Conductor and he led the Women's Services of Assam Rifles.
His daughter Lakshmi of India, who also has the power to commemorate her.
He's proud that his daughter took a nice picture, and took a nice place in the clutches.
Medha Jain wrote: A 92-year-old woman has been drinking water for several years at the Gwalior railway station.
Mehla ji is very inspired by the humble nature and compassion of this laxmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared.
You must read, take inspiration and share some things around yourself.
My best wishes to all these people of India.
My dear countrymen, Sachi Honnamma, the famous poet of the seventeenth century, wrote a poem in Kannada in the seventeenth century.
The idea is that all those Lakshmis of India whom we have spoken, it seems that they have been composed of the seventeenth century.
In this poem of Kannada, how beautiful words, how beautiful words and how high thoughts are: Peninda Permegandu Himavantu, Peninda Brigu Perchidanu Perchidanu Peninda Johnkarayanu Jaswandadu, i. e.
Our daughters have a strong integration of our society and a bright future through our pride and the great work of these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th edition of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated throughout the world on this day.
Guru Nanak Dev ji's influence is spread not only in India but in the whole world.
There are many of our Sikh brothers and sisters in this world who have completely dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget about my guru's visit to Vanquiver and Tehran.
There is a lot of talk about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji that I can share with you but this will take a lot of momentum.
He has always served on top of everyone.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believed that the selfless service work was invaluable.
He fought firmly against social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has delivered his message to the world.
He was one of the most travellers of his time.
He had visited many places and woken up the hearts of everyone through his simplicity, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has visited a number of important religious places.
It is said that Shankar Dev, the famous saint of Assam, was also inspired by his ideals.
He also travelled on the holy land of Haridar.
During his departure journey to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji solved the problem of water there.
Veterar, Guru Nanak Dev ji, a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, which reminds us of his words.
During a prayer, Guru Nanak ji also travelled north Kashmir and its surroundings.
This creates a strong link between the followers of Sikhism and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev ji went to Tibet and he was also accepted as Guru.
He traveled to Uzbekistan and he was also worshipped there.
And during a sad moment, he traveled to Islamic countries widely, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He lived in the hearts of millions of people, who have followed his advice with full pride and are doing it even today.
And this journey was organised with the aim of celebrating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
At the same time, all the princes, along with the Golden Temple Vision, also got the opportunity to learn about Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who bound the country with unity.
Just like Sardar Patel had a wonderful power to unite people, he was able to coordinate with those with whom there was a desperate difference.
Sardar Patel used to closely monitor and look into the testers.
He was a man of detail in this regard.
He was also skilled in the organizational skills.
He was particularly enthusiastic in planning and creating a range of skills.
When it is read or heard about the functioning of Sardar Saheb, it can be known how excellent the organisation would have been.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from across the country were present at the Ahmedabad session of the Congress.
He made sure nobody was suffering from water.
He interacted with the farmers and called for the creation of Khadi bags.
See again, that's why the sale of khadis has increased.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution Council.
He worked vitally to ensure our basic rights so that there is no possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste or community.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Swiss Minister of India, has done the historical and important task of uniting the Khand States and regions of this country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had a special characteristic that no one would have lost his vision.
On the one hand, his eyes focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
Similarly, the Lakshadweep of the south and his goal did not exhaust.
Indeed, when we mention the efforts of Sardar Patel, we discuss his role in just a few specific areas of this country.
Like Lakshadweep also for a small part but he played an important role .
Immediately after receiving this news, Sardar Patel took strict steps without delay.
He sent instructions to the brothers and sisters of Mudalia , Arcta Ramswami Mudaliar and Arcta Laxmanswamy Mudaliar who took them along with the dwellers of Travancore and floated the national flag there on time .
As per his instructions the waves were made and the desire to capture the neighbours on Lakshadweep was defeated .
After this incident Sardar Patel told the brothers and sisters of Mudalia that they personally ensure that all kinds of help is available in the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist destination .
I hope you're going to visit these beautiful islands and their seashores.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unit built in memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October, 2018 is dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the longest human idol of the world.
It's twice the American Statue of Liberty.
The longest statue of the world fills the heart of every Indian with pride -LRB- the heart fills with pride as Indian -RRB- when it is believed that the longest statue of the world is established in our country -LRB- in our country -RRB- .
In the self-confidence the head of every Indian becomes high .
You will be happy to know that only 26 lakh tourists had come to see the statue of Statue of Unity in a year .
That is , everyday about eight and a half thousand people have made the glorious wishes of this Statue of Unity .
For Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel the belief that he has in his heart , that is exhibited .
Now there are several attractive centres like cactus gardens, butterflies parks, wilderness safaris, child nutrition parks, unity nursery etc.
Professional training is also being provided in homesteps or houses for guest accommodation .
Local people have started the farming of dragon fruits and I am confident that this will become the main source of their livelihood .
Friends, For the country, for every state, for tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a study.
How can we testify that one place become a world famous tourist place within a year , where people from all over the country and abroad come .
Transportation, staying place, presence of guides, environmental financing - each one after another has been improving.
There has been a huge economic improvement and local public services are innovative as needed for tourists.
The government is pursuing its responsibility.
Friends , is there any Indian whose knowledge would not be proud to know that some days back the Time Papery has set up this Statue of Unity in the world ' s 100 best tourist places .
I hope you all will go to see this Statue of Unity by taking out some time from your precious time , but I wish that every Indian who goes out for tour , he goes to the last fifteen destinations of the country and stays there at night .
Friends, you know that every year 31st October is being celebrated as National Integration Day since 2014.
This day promises to maintain unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
Even today, the Run for Unity is being organised.
This will include the people of all sections of society.
Running is beneficial for both the mind and the body.
I hope that you all will participate in the 31st October- the goal of keeping the unity and yourself healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had bound the country with unity.
This mantra of unity should be a reform of our lives. We should try to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level in a diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and concerns of the country.
There will be many examples around us that are working for this purpose.
But sometimes their talk gets absorbed with our memory.
Friends, I remember that the month of September, 2010, when Allahabad High Court Ram gave birth opinion.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the former Prime Minister of our country, Smt. Indira Devi was also killed this day.
My dear countrymen, today if every household, every village has a song, from east to west, from north to south, every part of India, if a story is portrayed then it is cleanliness.
Every person, every family, every village, I want to express my joyful experience of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is a collective effort of hundreds of millions of Indians.
Therefore, it is a hundred crore Indians who have the right to profit.
But there is also a pleasant and thrilling experience.
I heard and I want to hear you too.
In such a difficult situation, it is not a less valour.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the country's borders, but they are also running a clean Siachen campaign.
There's so much cold that nothing melts.
In such a situation, it's an important task to segregate the dirt.
We all know that Siachen is a glacier that is the source of river and pure water.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in such a way is to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower areas and also use river water like Nubra and Shiok.
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that creates a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Deepawali, there is a lot of money especially for buying something or the other.
I once said we tried to buy local things.
If we find ourselves in our village, we don't need to go to Tahasil.
If we find it, we don't need to go to the district.
The more we try to buy local things, the more Gandhi 150 you will be transformed into a great festival.
And I always request that we don't talk to our swords, we should buy something or the other built by our khadi workers.
Even in this Deepawali, many have purchased a lot before Deepawali but there are also many who believe that after Deepawali, things will be cheaper.
So there's a lot of people who're still buying.
Therefore, along with paying homage to Deepawali, I appeal to you to come here, why should we be interested in local things or not
See, we can play an important role in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
We use baji as everyone in Deepawali.
But sometimes there's a fire with unconsciousness.
Sometimes wounded.
I appeal to all of you to be careful and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
I have many good wishes.
Thank you so much.
Mann Ki Baat, September, 2018
Are there any Indians who are not proud of our armed forces and our army personnel
Yesterday, 150 crore countrymen have celebrated the Paragram Parv.
We remember that the incident of the social strike in 2016, when our soldiers responded to those who were grateful to the name of Praxi Wire on the verge of terrorism in our country.
Our Armed Forces have organised exhibitions across the country so that the lions can feel the common people, especially the young generations of the country, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by spoiling their lives.
On the day of Parakarma Parv, our Armed Forces have the glorious heritage of the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also attended a function in Yodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of brave fighters.
It is sure that our soldiers will respond to all those who want to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress of our country.
But, with respect, we don't opt for all the powers of the country.
India is always committed to maintaining peace and security.
More than a million soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace in the two-two wars of the 20th century.
Our vision never falls on the ground of another country.
It was our responsibility towards peace.
Just a few days back, on 23rd September, we recalled the brave soldiers of Mahishur, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lansar, who had freed Haifa from the attackers.
This was also an exhibition demonstrated by our soldiers for peacekeeping.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of deployment of troops in the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations.
Over the decades, our fighters have been playing an important role in the peacekeeping system of the world by closing the blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, our air power is incomparable.
The Fly Paste, which is the most interested part of the masses in the Republic Day celebrations, has a glimpse of the unprecedented artistics and energy of our Air Force.
On 8th October, we celebrate the Bay of Bengal Day.
In 1947, when Pakistan's invaders began to attack, the airspace ensured that the Indian Army and the battlefields reach the war zone at the right time to protect Sri Nagar from the attackers.
In the 1965 war, the Air Force responded to the enemy.
Who doesn't know the Bangladeshi balloon in 1971
In 1999, the Air Force played a very important role in liberating Kargil from the enthusiasts.
In Tiger Hill, the airspace laid their foundations by continuously bombing the enemy's slope.
The entire country is grateful to them for their remarkable role in transportation and rescue operations and operational management.
The Air Force's contribution to combating natural calamities like storm, jealousy, floods or terrible pools and the help of the countrymen is reflective.
In order to ensure the equality of the gender equity in the country, the Air Force has also established a philosophy and has opened the doors of every department for the daughters of the country.
Now, along with the Shart Service Commission, Air Force women are also giving the opportunity to choose the Personnel Commission, which I announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that the Indian Armed Forces are not only men but also women power.
The whole country was worried about how to save her.
You must know that Ablash Tommy is a brave, brave and brave soldier of the Navy.
The first Indian to visit the world with a small boat without any modern technology.
Over 80 days, the Golden Globe races in the south of the Indian Ocean were part of a terrible marine storm.
I'm supposed to do something such adventurous.
I pray for the rapid health of Abhilash Tommy and hope that this courage, this bravery, this determination - the strength to win this fight will inspire the young generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, children are also aware of the importance of the day of 2nd October.
This year, there is another special significance.
For the next two years, we are going to celebrate several programmes across the globe to mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The thoughts and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have reached the whole world today.
Men like Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandeller have gained strength from Gandhijis vision, they have struggled to achieve equal rights and dignity of the people.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to discuss with you another important task of worshipping Bapu which is necessary for all the people of the country.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme or an organisational programme.
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle became empowered, Gandhiji made a revised reflection of his thoughts.
Worshipping farmers, the people of the village, the people of the village, the people of the village, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, and the people of the people, and the people of the people.
Popular Bapu was a people's friend.
Together with the people, the importance of Bapu to accept the people was his nature.
This is the valuable feature of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He congratulated the people of the country that they are important and necessary for the development of the country.
He made this achievement the best contribution to the freedom struggle.
Mahatma Gandhi's invitation to freedom struggle was dedicated to the people of every section of the society.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which we know as the magic of Gandhiji.
Gandhiji said, "I am telling you a strategy that whenever you feel skeptical or arrogant, remember my thoughts.
Remember the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen in life and ask yourself what steps you are thinking about will be beneficial for that person.
I mean, will it achieve crores of hungry and disappointed people
Only then will you notice that your doubts were resolved and the arrogance was resolved.
My dear countrymen, a trick of Gandhiji is still equally important.
The economic strength and purchasing power of the growing middle class of the country is opposite today.
If the benefits reach the poor, then my happiness will also increase manifold.
Whenever we buy something in Gandhiji's trick in the coming days, we must keep in mind that every purchase of our countrymen is good and those who have sweated in the production of goods, those who have invested in their talent, those who have used their talent will get some benefit.
This is Gandhijis trick, this is Gandhijis message. I believe that a small step can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today, we can feel that through this small task, we can contribute to the economic progress and economic empowerment of our country, to the strength of fighting against poverty.
And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today, this is the reverence to the work of revered Bapu.
Think about buying fertilizer and handicrafts on a special occasion.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji with revered Bapu.
As soon as the name of Shastri ji is high, we have an indispensable respect for the people of India.
His magnificent personality always fills the hearts of every country.
He was very soft from outside, but he was firm in his heart.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan was the introducer of his great personality.
During a short span of about a year and a half, he has given the mantra to reach the top of the achievements of the youth and farmers of the country, which is the result of his selflessness towards the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this campaign. I am also fortunate to give cleanliness to the children at the Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school, whose foundation was laid by the renowned father.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate Worlds all have empowered cleanliness.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to all the sanitation lovers for this.
Come on, let's hear a call, "Namskar, my name is Satan Singh.
I especially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in the country but also in the entire world.
This time India is going to organise the worlds largest cleanliness summit Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
The officers of the Ministry of Cleanliness from all over the world and experts from all over the world will come and share the use and experiences of Cleanliness.
It is imperative to ensure freedom, peace and justice to the exploited, suffering and deprived.
Inspired by his thinking, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 1993.
The NHRC will complete 15 years in a few days.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights, but also helped in increasing the spiritual pride.
Our sympathetic leader, former Prime Minister Prayat Atal Bihari Vajpayee clearly stated that human rights are not foreign ideas.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal policy of the Vedic era is decorated with Sarve Bhawantu Sukin:
The NHRC has made widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
The Commission has created an environment of hope and trust amongst the people of the country during this visit of the twenty-five years.
I think it is very hopeful for democratic values to create a healthy society.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been constituted as well as work on human rights at the national level.
All these great men have inspired us, we salute them.
This year too, we are eager to organize Run for Unity in our villageganj, towns, in Mahanagar.
This is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all that through the Run for Unity on 31st October, we strengthen this effort to bind every section of society in the form of unity and that will be the best tribute to them.
My dear countrymen, Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijaya Dashmi, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you all for these sacred festivals.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August, 2018
Today, the whole country is celebrating the Rakhi Bandhan Festival.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen on this pilgrimage
This festival of Rakhi Bandhan symbolizes the love and belief of sisters and brothers.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There have been many incidents in the history of the country when it has been seen that how a defense base has bound the people of both the states and different religions.
Just a few days later.
The winds of the sky will be heard by the horse-paul ki Jai Kanhaiya Lal-ki and Gobind-Govinda.
It's a different joy to meet you in Krishna's color.
Children have also started organising Dahi-Handi in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
I'm grateful to Chinmayi that she has taken care of this.
Friends, Apart from Rakhi Bandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those who are working to keep this great heritage alive, move ahead and reach the people.
Every language has its own importance.
In every aspect of life, there is a huge share of knowledge in Sanskrit language and literature.
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, astronomy or architecture, bank or management, economic or environment, the Ministry of fighting with challenges like global warming is also detailed in our country.
You will be happy to know that all the people of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit as a medium of interaction today.
You will be surprised to know one thing that Sanskrit is a language in which the manufacturing of infinite words is possible.
If we have to weigh something then we use English quotations, sometimes we call poetry etc.
But those who know about the defined words of Sanskrit know how few words can be explained through these defined words of Sanskrit.
"Real, if a Guru gives his disciplinary knowledge to his disciple, then there is no such thing or wealth in the entire world that can liquidate the disciplinary Guru's debt.
We always remember the great philosopher and former President of India, Bharat Ratna Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on the auspicious occasion of the Teacher's Day.
On his birth anniversary, the Teacher's Day is celebrated across the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teacher's Day, and recall their dedication to science, education and students and their devotion.
My dear countrymen, our farmers, who work hard, bring news of the rains.
Just a few days ago, we saw how a terrible flood had triggered the lives of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the whole country has come to Kerala.
Those who have lost their loved ones in this regard, I express my deep condolences to those families.
But I want to assure all those sad families that you have a right hand hand in the shoulders of 125 crore countrymen.
I pray that those who are hurt by this natural calamity get healthy.
I am confident that the lives of Kerala will be faster and faster, depending on indomitable lifestyle and courage.
The way the disaster destroys life, it is extremely unfortunate, but in this two days we also get the religion of humanity.
Every person from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kanyakumari to Kanyakumari is trying his best to save the lives of the people of Kerala or any district or region of India.
People of all age groups and people associated with all kinds of work are enhancing their support.
Everyone is wondering how to share the sufferings and sufferings of the people of Kerala, so that it can be slackened.
We all know that the soldiers of the Armed Defence Forces are the heroes of this disaster in Kerala.
They have taken all kinds of measures to save the people of the destruction.
Air Force, Navy or Army, B-S-F, C-I-S-F, and A-F each have jumped into rescue operations.
I specially want to mention the hard work of NDRF personnel.
The way they worked in combating these dangers, they demand a lot of praise.
The capacity of NDRF, their obligations and swift decision-making capabilities have created a honourable seat in the minds of all the citizens.
Dear Countrymen, this time we went to read the suggestions sent for Mann Ki Baat. The most people have written about it are our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Bats from Sonipat, Kerala's brother Praveen from West Bengal, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, and many more people requested me to speak about the various aspects of Atal ji's life in Mobile App and Mai Gave.
On 16th August, the people of the country and the world have received the news of Atal ji's efforts.
He was a leader who had left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and had gone far away from active politics in the last ten years.
He wouldn't have been special in the news.
The explanation of the affection, respect and condolences of all for Atal ji is a reflection of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
Today, I want to tell you about the great personality of Atal ji. It is the political culture that he has launched. He has tried to bring about the changes in the political culture and the efforts made to provide a sustainable framework to political culture.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 11th Amendment Ordinance, 2003.
This amendment brings about two important changes in the politics of our country.
The first is to limit the total seats of the Assembly to fifteen percent.
Atal ji will transform this system, resulting in efficiency and efficiency of resources.
Atal ji was the only visionary who brought about changes in the situation and initiated healthy and well-being in politics.
Atal ji was a real patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji replaced the budget by fifteen in the evening.
And another Azadi, we benefit from the work of Atal ji through the creation of Indian Flag Code.
It takes place since 2002, resulting in triangular revolt at public places.
Common Indians get the opportunity to hoist the national flag.
In this way, he brought our favourite Trianga to the masses.
You have seen how Atal ji has changed the vote process and has strengthened the country by taking bold steps in the election of the people.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the Parliament today, there is talk of obstacles and humiliation but when something happens, there is no special discussion about it.
Just a few days back, the Parliament session is over.
You will be happy to know that the producing of the Lok Sabha was 118 percent and the Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
The result of this was that the Lok Sabha 21T and Rajya Sabha passed 14 Bills.
This meeting of Parliament will be reminiscent of social justice and youth.
In this session, several important bills have been passed to improve the youth and backward classes.
You all know that for centuries, it has been demanding the formation of an OBC commission like SCST Commission.
To ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution of the formation of the OBC Commission and has given it a statutory right.
This step will help in achieving the objectives of social justice.
The session also commenced to pass a revised bill to safeguard the rights of the Tapashili castes and the Tapashili tribals.
The Act will further protect the interests of the SC and ST classes.
At the same time, it will save their transgressors from the atrocities and increase their faith.
There is no injustice to women in the country.
The offenders of the crime will be punished for at least 10 years and the rape of girls under 12 years of age will be punished.
Just a few days ago, you may have read in the newspapers, a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh, after just two months of hearing, have sentenced a couple of innocent people to commit rape.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh, after hearing only five days, punished the culprits.
A court in Rajasthan also made such a rapid appeal.
The Act will play a constructive role in resolving the crime case against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
The three Talaq Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, though it is not possible to pass this session in Rajya Sabha, I want to convince Muslim women, the entire country is with all the strength to give justice to them.
When we come forward to protect the interests of the country, it is possible to transform the lives of poor, backward, exploited and deprived.
At this interaction, all of you have made an ideal one by one.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, at this moment, millions of people are committed to the Asian Games organized in the wake of their vision.
Every morning, in newspapers, television, news and social media, any Indian player has won the medals.
The Asian Games is still going on.
I congratulate all those who have won the medal for the country.
I congratulate those who are still in the race.
The players of India, especially the shooting and resisting, are showing good results in the games that we have not been able to perform well before, our players are also taking medals like Wushu and Rowing.
These are not mere medals, it is a testimony to the courage to touch Indian sports and the courage to touch Indian competitions and their dreams.
Our daughters are in the list of medal winners for the country.
Many of the youth who won the medals are 15-16 years of age.
It is also a good sign that many of the players who have won the medals have come up from the infamous villages and fountains, and have done this hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate the National Sports Day, I extend my best wishes to all the sportspersons, along with my best wishes to Hockey magician Shri Dhanchand ji.
My appeal to all citizens of the country, sports and pay attention to your fitness, because a healthy India will build a rich and rich India.
When India is fit, the bright future of India will be built.
Once again, I congratulate the winners of the Asian Games and congratulate the other players for their best results.
But the Vrihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu is the place where this unforgettable mixture of architecture and engineering is seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the ueen Ki Baw of the Eleventh century in Patna, Gujarat.
Indian territory is always an experiment of engineering.
There are many engineers born in India who have imagined the unimaginable and have made examples of the unparalleled achievements of the engineering world.
Our great engineers have a rich heritage treasure, whose work still surprises people.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
He also recalled the people of the rest of the country with great respect and respect.
In his memory, 15th September was celebrated as the Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their independent identity in the world.
Recalling the unprecedented achievements of the engineering world, in 2001, I recall a tragedy of that terrible earthquake of Kutch in Gujarat.
He was joking at me, look at my house.
It's Bhunga.
My house saw three earthquakes.
When he was proud of this thing, I am confident that even a long time ago, our engineers used to build houses in local environment and situations, which would save the people.
Now when we celebrate the Engineers' Day, we will have to think about the future, we will have to organize workshops at different places.
Would we like to learn new things during the transition
Do you have to learn
The world is fighting with natural calamities.
What's the new use of structural engineering here
What's his course
What should be taught to students
I extend my best wishes to all of you for this thought.
I'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July, 2018
Encouraging people's thinking.
You must have seen on TV that a team of 12 young football players and their coaches went to a cave in Thailand.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But that day Bhagya ji had a different desire.
When they entered the cave, a lot of water gets accumulated in the face of the cave due to heavy rains.
All efforts are being made to know where the youngsters are, how they are in the circumstances and how they can be brought out.
But I want to see the whole incident in a different way.
The government, the parents of the children, the family members, the people of the media, the citizens of the country have shown an integral behaviour of peace and patience.
Everyone has been involved in this mission.
I think it is a matter of learning and health.
Parents haven't been sorry or mother hasn't put her eyes.
Everyone's patience, restraint and the peaceful use of the entire society is really a lesson for us.
A soldier from the Thailand Navy had to be killed in this operation.
The entire world is surprised that despite such a terrible situation, rescuers have worked with courage and patience in the humidity of the humid dark cave.
This incident shows that when people are united, there are many surprising things.
It is necessary that we observe ourselves in a quiet mind and work for it.
A few days ago, the popular poet Neeraj tried.
The speciality of poet Neeraj was hope, trust, determination and self-confidence.
Everything of poet Neeraj can inspire all our Indians.
He writes: The darkness will be overcome as soon as the storm is burnt when the darkness is over.
The month of July and August is very important for farmers and all youngsters.
Because this is the time when Pic Sessions for colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam get out of school and go to college.
Resolutions, future life guidelines and Career Chains have to be spent as well as enjoying the holidays in April and May.
July is the month when the youngsters take steps towards their life innovative ways, when the focus is shifted from Kochen to Cut-off.
The focus of the students goes from home to hostel.
Students enter the rooftop of Professors from the rooftop of PERENT.
My belief is that my young friends are very inspired and happy about the start of college life.
For the first time, get out of the house, go out of the village, get out of a safe environment and make yourself a guide.
All these young men leave their homes and take life forward in a new way.
There is no way but to study, but we have to keep looking for innovative things.
Old friends are valuable.
Those youngsters who are going to leave their homes and find out the place and know about the people there, languages, cultures.
I congratulate all the youngsters.
Her dad's been fooling the filth of the slaughterhouse forever.
In that situation, I congratulate Ashram for this achievement.
There are so many distressed family students who have shown their hard work and attention in adverse conditions that inspire us all.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father, D-T-C, or habit Gupta of Kolkata, who studied under the light of the road in the footpath, is Afreen Sheikh, the daughter of Afreen Sheikh, whose father is Auto Chalan, the daughter of the schoolgirl of Nagpur, Kartik, son of Haryana Chaukedar, or the son of the brick-wheeler of Jharkhand, Ramesh Sahu.
Anushka Panda, a residual daughter of Gurgaon, has been a victim of hereditary disease called Spinal Mascular Autopsy, who has achieved the world with their determination and determination.
We'll find so many examples around ourselves.
Any good incident in any corner of the country gives me strength and inspiration.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I saw a news in which it was written: "Modi's dream was fulfilled by two young people.
After reading the news inside, I realized how our young power is trying to transform the lives of the common man through the smart and creative use of technology.
Once in the city of San Jose, the technology hub of America, I had requested the Indian youth to think of how to use their talent for India and take time out.
I requested to transform Brain-Drain into Brain-GAIN.
Two I-T professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayeeji have tried their best by confessing this challenge.
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji made a Smart Gram App.
This app will not only connect the people of the village with the world, but they will now get any information or news on their mobile phones.
The App provides all the telephone directories of the village, News Sackshans, Events Lists, Health Centres and Normation Centres.
The App is also very useful for the farmers. The App features are being used for selling their products from one side to the other.
Thank you very much for your call
Indeed, the pilgrimage of Pundharpur is a unique festival.
Friends, The eighth month of Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July this year, was shifted to Pondicherry in Pondicherry.
Pundharpur is a sacred city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
The sannyas like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are placed in Paduka Palaki and sent to Pantharpur to dance in the name of Vithal Bhagwan.
Bhagwan Bitthal, which is also called Bithova or Pandurung, visits the devotee.
Lord Bittal defends the poor, the helpless, the sufferers.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have great respect and devotion towards this god.
You go to the Vithova Temple of Pantharpur, there is a different feeling of magnificence, beauty and spiritual happiness.
My request to the audience of the Mann Ki Baat is that if the opportunity comes, you will surely achieve the experience of the pilgrimage of Pundharpur.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still teaching the common people in Maharashtra.
We have received advice from them for sovereignty, love and brotherhood like Varud or Abhang.
The society can fight with respect to blind faith and we get this mantra from here.
They have shown the right path to the society at the right time and have ensured that the old culture from the society is removed and have brought the idea of compassion, equality and purity among the people.
Just like this was a great man, Lokmanya Tilak, who has made a deep impression in many Indians.
We remember Tilak ji's birth anniversary on 23rd July, and on the occasion of his death anniversary.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave with courage and self-confidence.
He had the power to misunderstand the British rulers.
The Englishman Tilk was so scared that he had been accused of sedition three-three times in a twentie years.
I am telling you about a particular incident about the statue of Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October, 1916 - Think about 100 years ago, more than forty thousand people were agitated to welcome him.
Later, as the mayor of the Municipal Corporation, Vallabhbhai Patel decided to set up a memorial of Mahamanya Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Generally, the British rulers were very unhappy about this and the clerks there used to repeat the construction of a memorial called Smaru Hela.
But Sardar Saheb, he will resign, but he will leave the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, on 28th February, 1929, he invited Mahatma Gandhi to inaugurate the statue of Sardar Patel.
On the occasion of the Maha-Udghatan, Bapu said that only one person could not get the name of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation Mayor, with a power to establish the statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, one of the characteristics of the statues that the statue had established the Sardar Patel was founded here in Lokmanya Tilak ji's chair.
The English had to listen to the orders of God.
The first public Ganesh Festival was inaugurated by Lokmanya Tilak.
Even when the public Ganesh Festival grew rich in traditional respect and hosting, society became an effective medium for creating awareness, unity, sympathy and compassion.
Ganesh Mandapa is now seen in the streets of any city.
All the family members of the street together organise the festival of Ganesha.
This is an unparalleled opportunity for our youngsters to achieve special capabilities such as organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have said last time that I am going to recall Lokmanya Tilak ji, even today, you will celebrate the Ganesha Festival with fervor but celebrate the Ganesha Festival.
Ganesh ji's idol, his decorations and pujas are all environmental.
Those who dedicated their lives so that the people of the country can breathe in independent India.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
There is a young man in India who cannot be inspired by listening to this perspective.
Chandrasekhar Azads bravery and unity for freedom inspired many youths.
Azad had saved his life, but never wasted his head in front of foreign rule.
I am fortunate that there is an opportunity to visit Chandrasekhar Azad village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute the two great children of Bharatmata, Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days back, the Junior Index in Finland won 400 m race in the World Athletics Championships, India's external daughter, Kisanna Hima Das, a gold medal winner.
The country's another daughter, Ekta Bhawan, e-mails me from Indonesia and is preparing for the Asian Games.
I am proud that Mahendrakhan in the life of an athlete when he shook the waves and showed it to me.
Unity, we all are proud of you.
Her achievements are remarkable because she has made her challenges a medium of success.
In 2003, the road accident unity fell into the bottom of the body, but this girl didn't lose courage and strengthened herself.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Ekta Bhayan ji, Yogesh Katunia ji, Sunder Singh ji for their courage and struggle.
You can move ahead, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, in the last few months, there have been many incidents of history and festivals, but sometimes diseases also enter the house due to the weather.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to all of you for the good health and the inspiration of the countrymen for this month of August and for many festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Mann Ki Baat will meet again.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, on this occasion of Mann Ki Baat once again, it is fortunate to be face to face with you all.
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bangalore.
You might have understood that I'm talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was the first international test match in Afghanistan, and the pride of all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The match showcases the best sports talent.
Rashid Khan, a boss of Afghanistan, played a very good role in the IPL this year, and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shri Ashrafgani, had tagged me in his Twitter, "The people of Afghanistan are very proud of his hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase our sportspersons.
The best of Afghanistan, Rashid represented him. "
He is a wealth in the world of cricket, and he has written a little joke and says, "No, I don't want to give it to anyone."
This match will be reminded of all of us.
Though it was the first match, it was natural to remember, but this match would be reminded of another thing.
The Indian team has done a job that is unimaginable all over the world.
When the Indian team took the trophy, what could a winner team do
While taking the Indian team trophy, the Afghanistan team invites those who are playing international matches for the first time and calls together.
We can realize what can happen to Sportsman Spirit and Sportsmanship
The best way to find out the talent of the sports community and the achievements of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, a magnificent sight has been seen on the 4th Yoga Day.
Be it the Brussels-European Parliament or the Chief of the United Nations in New York or the Japanese Navy fighters, people are doing yoga exercises everywhere.
The historic event of Yoga was organised for the first time in Saudi Arabia, and I am told that women have also done several seats.
India and China have contributed together to the high snow peaks of Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participate in the Yoga Day programme with such enthusiasm then why would it not be encouraged in India
Our Air Force fighters have pillared everyone by doing yoga at a height of 15000 feet from the ground between the sky.
There was a sight, they didn't sit in the air, they were in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or sports grounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A sight of Ahmedabad was enchanting, while around 750 demographic brothers and sisters made records by doing yoga at one place.
I am happy that today Yoga is working as a welfare and revolution.
One attempt of Wellness is being made by Yoga, I hope that it will move forward.
Gradually, more people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
"Thank you for your phone.
Did you go to Kabirdas ji's imaghar
He is the realistic comrade who can know the sufferings of others.
Those who don't know the sufferings of others, they're foolish.
Kabir Das ji emphasized on social coordination.
"Wirey Koi Nehi in the world, the minds are cold.
Please give it to you, please.
Kabir Das ji says, "Where is the religion, the love and the sin.
This invaluable statement of his has been influenced even today, and now when we talk about Saint Kabir Das Ji, one of his compassions is remembered.
This is the greatness of the Guru and a Guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have shown millions of people the path of truth, which has been inspiring people from time to time.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be inaugurated in 2019.
One more history that is associated with Punjab.
In 2019, the terrible incident of Jallianwala Bagh, which is going to be completed for 100 years, was the incident that jealousized humanity.
On 13th April, 1919, somebody forgot the black day when all the boundaries of the ruthlessness of power were executed on innocent, unarmed and innocent people.
This miraculous incident is going to be completed for 100 years, but we will always remember the sustainable message that has been given to us that no problem can ever be solved through violence and violence.
Peace, arrogance, sacrifice and sacrifice always win.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App on 6th July, 2019.
Ramanji, thank you very much first
It is very good to see you interested in the history of India.
You know, on June 23 last year, Dr.
Perhaps very few people knew that in 1937, Dr.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore spoke in Bengal at the Convocation of Kolkata University, inviting Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
This was the first example when a person spoke in Bengal during the British rule at the Convocation of Kolkata University.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee was the first industrialist of India and in a sense, he founded a strong foundation stone of Indias progress in the development and development of India in a universal way, on a strong foundation and platform.
In 1948, the first instruction of independent India was based on its plans and vision.
Dr.
Mukherjee had a dream that India would be self-reliant and prosperous in every sector of the industry.
He wanted India to build a big industry and also look at MSMEs, cotton, textiles and cotton crafts.
He got the Financial and Organization set up for the proper development of cottage crafts and small scale industries, as well as the All-II between 1948 and 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very emotional about the progress of West Bengal.
His thinking, understanding and activism have saved a part of West Bengal and it is still a part of India.
Come, let us recall the message of this unity of Dr.
My dear countrymen, for the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to talk to those people who have benefitted from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I got the opportunity to come out of the file and listen directly to people's faces.
People have said their resolve, their happiness and sorrow.
I think it was not just a government function, but it was another kind of learning experience. And what could be more satisfactory than what I have seen in the eyes of the people at this time
When I heard a common man, his simple words, his simplicity, his feelings touched the heart.
I knew how women from remote villages are helping from the Common Service Centre to create passports for the elderly and the elderly from Pension.
A sister from Chhattisgarh has collected ice cream from her and lakhs of young people like Jan Aushadhi system in Jharkhand have been supplying pharmaceuticals to the surrounding villages.
The young man in West Bengal who was looking for a job two-three years ago, now he is not only doing his business successfully, he has distributed 10-15 people with jobs.
On the other hand, school students in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working at a very young age like West Management at the Textile Lab.
There was a story of innumerable experiences and there was no corner of the country from where there was no message of success.
I am happy to note that with the achievements of the government, the strength of the common man, the strength of the country and the strength of the country, the strength of the dream of a New India, the strength of the resolve.
There are some people in the society who don't talk about despair, don't talk about despair, don't do the job of unbelieving, don't find a way to break instead of gargling, they don't get peace.
In such an environment, when the common man speaks of the achievements of his life with a new hope and a new spirit, his achievements are not achieved by the government.
A small girl from a remote village also inspires 125 crore people.
I'm grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people are associated with this video bridge and have given me a new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I also felt this smell of goodness.
It is a matter of fact that the corporate professionals of Bangalore have created an I-T engineers together and have activated this Trust to double the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, they are associated with the farmers, the projects have been constructed and efforts are being made to improve the income of the farmers.
How to harvest organic farming with new methods of farming and how to harvest crops along with other crops, these trains are being provided to the farmers through this trust.
Earlier, the farmers who were dependent on only one crop, which would not have been good and benefitted, today they are not only blossoming many crops but also benefiting from the right marketing of the crops through this Trust.
Fruits will be good only when good quality seeds will be used, so that the seed bank has been made separately.
Women work for this Seed Bank, and women are also associated with it.
My dear countrymen, one year of GST system is going to be completed.
The dreams of the countrymen were fulfilled today.
If I have to credite someone for this system, then I will give this credit to the states.
G-ST is a beautiful example of Cooperative Federalism, where all the states have decided to take into account the welfare of the country and as a result, such a large tax reform system has been implemented in the country.
So far, 27-T meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can be proud that the decisions taken in the GST Council, despite the presence of representatives of different political ideologies, representatives of different States and separate Priorities, have been accepted so far.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before GST but after the implementation of this system, the same tax system is now in the entire country.
After the GST, check posts have also been closed and this has resulted in increased transportation of goods and other goods, which not only saved time but also benefits in logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the world's largest tax reform system.
India has achieved such a huge tax reform because the people of the country have accepted this system and this manpower has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that such a large size of reforms takes 5 to 7 years to be implemented properly in such a large country of population.
But the enthusiasm of the true countrymen, the flow of the country's eternal festivals and the partnership of the people's power is that within a year, this new tax system has created its own place, it has got its status and has been revising itself through the necessary influencing system.
This is a great achievement that has achieved 125 crore people of the country.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must have remembered that a team of six women's commanders of the Navy had been roaming over the past few months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama, I want to say something about this.
The team of these six daughters of India returned to India on May 21 last year through more than 250 days INS-V Tarini and the whole country has warmly welcomed them.
Several oceans and some seas have crossed around 22,000 nautical distances.
It's a strange incident all over the world.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
I once again congratulate the daughters for their brave work, for enhancing the fame of the navy, for enhancing the dignity of India and especially the daughters of India in any part of the world.
You must have seen that in the last few days Mount Everest-Jai people have received new information.
On 16th May, five tribal students of a Ashram Vidyalaya of Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisha Dhurube, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Dhabi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Swaam - have won the highest rank in the world.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh from August 2017.
They were selected in Mission Shaurya.
And by winning Everest with the name, they have brightened the country's name.
I convey my best wishes to these young students of Chandrapur School.
Sixteen-year-old Shivangi Pathak has won Everest from Nepal as the youngest Indian woman.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia Everest won the first shoe of father-son.
Not only did the youth win Everest, but on 19th May, the 5000th Smt. Sangeeta Behl also won Everest.
Some of the Everest ascendants are not only skilled, but also feelings.
This work is not only praiseworthy but also reflects their commitment towards cleanliness and environment.
I congratulate all those brave brave brave men, especially the daughters.
A large number of people from different fields will come forward to support this.
On the occasion of Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more we play.
In social media, people are sharing the video of their Fitness Challenge and also changing them by tagging others.
I believe that this is a very good process and this kind of challenge encourages us to keep ourselves fit and to fit others.
My dear countrymen, many times in Mann Ki Baat, you have heard something about me, sportspersons.
"Thank you very much for your call
These games were a special part of the summer holidays.
There are two traditional games.
Outdoor is still indoor.
The unity among the diversity of our country may be seen somewhere in these games.
The same game is known by different names.
It is played at the 8th square board of 8th or 8th square.
The name of this is Attu in Madhya Pradesh, Champal in Kerala, Diyam in Tamil Nadu and Changapo in Rajasthan.
Even if the people of different states don't know each other's language, they look right at playing
That's a game that can be seen everywhere in the village.
It is also known as different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Total or Karavilla.
It is called Pillwadi in Odisha, which is called Vittidalu in Maharashtra.
Traditional sports are like this that helps in strengthening our physical empowerment as well as strengthening our legal thumbling, concentration, awakening and prosperity.
These are not only sports, they teach the values of our lives, to achieve our goals, to achieve our determination, to create team spirit, to help each other.
Just a few days ago, I had seen that in the training programs of the business management, our traditional sports have been included in the development of the entire personality and incremental skills.
At the same time, we are also committed to our culture and tradition.
Some games conscious about our society, environment etc.
Now the school, the school, the school and the youth should come forward and encourage these sports.
Through Crood Sourcing, we can create a museum of heritage sports.
This game can be made so that the rules of sports can be shown about how to play.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation can know about these games, play and grow bigger.
The theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
We all ensure that we don't use the Polythene, Low Grade plastic and try to reduce the harmful impact of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I urge all the information from the World Environment Day website wedindia 2018 to try to use it in my daily life.
It's dead, wealth is damaged.
This is the result of the change that has taken place in the Weather Pattern.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi has said for his entire life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justise, it has played a key role in the COP 21 and Paris Agreement. We have collected the entire world through International Solar Alliance.
In this entrance day, we think of what we can do to make this world more clean and green.
How can we move ahead on this path, what innovation can we do
Rainfall is coming.
Now we can plant a record number of trees, not only planting but it is also necessary to take care of it until the tree grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You will remember everybody on 21st June, not just you-I, but the whole world will now remember on 21st June.
The World is now celebrated as International Day of Yoga on 21st June and it is accepted that a few months back the preparation of the event begins.
It is reported that preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day across the world.
Yoga enhances courage, which always protects us like father.
Forgiveness is created as Mother feels her own child, mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
Vartuhari said that by doing regular yoga, the truth is that our children, our brotherhood, our self-confidence, our illiteracy, our world, our bed and knowledge work to fulfil our hunger.
Whenever someone is so powerful, this Yoga is naturally enjoying all kinds of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the citizens to take forward the great heritage of Yoga and create a healthy, happy and emotional nation.
My dear countrymen, today, 27th May, India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's Tirodhana Day.
I salute Pandit Ji.
In May, 1857, Indians introduced their power to the British.
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers were insistent on injustice.
Regrettably, we have been calling the incident of 1857 only rebellion or sepoy rebellion for a long time.
Indeed, this incident wasn't just a little, it was an attempt to hurt our self-respect.
This brave servicer said that what happened in 1857 was not a power, but the first fight for freedom.
The heroes of India House, London, along with Savarkar, celebrated the Fifteenth birth anniversary.
He was a servant of both weapons and sciences.
In fact, Veer Savarkar, who is known for his synagogue against Bahaduri and British Raj.
Besides this, he was also an eminent poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on integrity and unity.
A strange description has been given about Savarkar ji, our dear, dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Savarkar is taking both poetry and revolution.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters who had once been forced to beg from the garbage stupa to the house-to-house - today they are serving the poor by learning the work of the toilet.
I extend my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and trust.
They have shown that if you are keen to show something and you are grateful for that, it can be achieved in any difficult situation and it can be seen not only in the case of Sikar but in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighbors, you'll see how people are defeating the problem.
You have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we feel satisfaction by eating tea there, some people also have discussions and analysis.
These discussions are political, social, films, sportspersons, and the problems of the country should be solved in such a way, but most of these discussions are limited to discussions.
He organised education, health and diet for all children coming to school.
He snatched the darkness of their life.
TAMSO MAJORTHAGAME: "Who doesn't know this sadness, but it has shown you D.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and for all of us.
There will be a lot of inspirations around you.
There are innumerable incidents.
Come, let us take positive mindset forward.
It's so hot in the month of June that people wait for rain and wait for the sky clouds.
A few minutes from today, people will also wait for the moon.
To see the moon is either either either.
At the end of a month's fast on Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a symbol of the shining festivities.
My belief is that Ids will be celebrated with every year, especially the children will get good Eids.
I hope that the festival of Id will further strengthen the eternal bonds of our society.
I don't like you all.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.

We've crossed a lot of obstacles and reached this place.
Today, their parents, parents, coaches, other assistants, school, school teachers or school environment have played a very important role in this lifespan that they have achieved.
The friends are also playing roles that have enhanced the mindset of the players in all the situations.
With the players, I congratulate all of them, thank you.

Damn butterflies have written a picture of their trekking.
Traveling and trekking for me is Fit India.
It is a pleasure to see that a few people, too, are encouraging our youth for Fit India in a very attractive manner.
Picturewinner Akshaykumar gave a video on Twitter.
I've seen that video, you're sure you're gonna see him doing his wooden work in this video.
He said that this exercise is very beneficial for the muscles of stomach and back.
I think this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us and for all of us.
You're also ready.
On 21st June, the importance of International Yoga Day has now been accepted by the entire world.
There is no need to tell anybody in India or in the world to keep Yoga inclusive in physical development, mental development and mental condition normal.
You might have seen an animated video, where I've been shown.
I am grateful to the anaemia preparers for doing this thing with great care.
My young friends, you all are coming out of the clutches of testing and testing.
I want to invite you today for a new job.
I have seen that many youngsters are spending time to learn something new.
Outside the four walls, papers and communicators, there is a chance to live a new life.
My young friends, I would like to appeal to you today for a special internship, three-four ministries of the Government of India such as sports, human resources development, drinking water department, including the Swachh Bharat Summer I.
Those who have worked very well in colleges and universities will be awarded the national level and those who have successfully worked with me.
I once again invite the students and youngsters to join the internship and benefit them.
I hope that our young society will take forward the Swachhta movement.
I want to know about all your efforts.
You must send your experiences, send your story, send photos, send video.
Regularly look at India's programme, how many people from different parts of the country are doing good work and how well they are discussing.
Just a few days ago, I had seen that some young people from Delhi, who are falling unconsciously for poor children, have started a good job for the education of the guides and settlement children of Delhi.
Initially, they suggested to the boys who worked hard on the roads and also participated in the developmental work.
The programme, organised by 15 children from Delhi's Geetha colony, has been implemented today to study two thousand children at 12 places in the capital.
In this campaign, young teachers are working hard to transform society by removing two-hour free times from their perpetual busyness.
Brothers and sisters, Just like this, some farmers from Uttarakhand have established an inspiration for the farmers across the country.
They have not only changed their fate, but also changed their fate.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, originally peas, wheat and yellow are grown.
The farmers were not able to afford their crops due to the hilly area, but the farmers of the Copcort तहसीलs took their crops directly to the market and made the path of value addition.
They have made biscuits from the field crops and are selling the biscuits.
These farmers have created a government institution in Munnar and opened the biscuit bakery.
In view of this efforts of the farmers, the administration has included it in the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit has spread to almost 50 Anganwadi Centres of Bageshwar district, even Kosani Almora.
With this efforts of the farmers, the turnover of the institution has reached not only 10 to 15 lakhs but also more than 900 families have been provided with food processing.
Dear Countrymen, I have often heard that the war for water will begin in the coming days.
Everyone says, but we have no responsibility
Water conservation is not new to Indians.
It's not about reading books, so there is no need to know any particular language.
In the past, our ancestors have shown it.
He gave the most importance to the importance of water every drop.
They made new ways to save every drop of water.
If you visit Tamilnadu, you will see that in many temples there, inscriptions are available for water conservation, water conservation, water conservation, drainage etc.
There are large inscriptions in the temples of Manarkovil , Chiran Mahadevi Kobilpatti and Pudukottai .
Even today, many bounties are known as Step Wells tourist destinations, but in fact they are a vivid proof of the water conservation efforts of our ancestors.
You must go to Rajasthan to see the moon bowl of Yodhpur.
This is Indias largest and most beautiful bounty, one thing we need to remember is the largest bounty in a region where there is a rapid thunderstorm of water.
The work of water conservation will be as effective as possible in April, May, June and July.
Manrega Buzette can be spent in water conservation.
In the last three years, many efforts are being made to create water conservation and water conservation.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent in the construction of water conservation and water dams in Manrega Buzette every year.
In 2017-18, I can say that 55 of the 64 thousand crore rupees have been spent in water conservation programmes of about 35 thousand crore rupees.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of agricultural farming has been benefitted through water conservation and water conservation.
This work has been done in the work of about 40 to 45 villages.
I would like to say that April, May, June and July are coming and we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water conservation in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, when Mann Ki Baat comes, news comes from all over the country, letters and phones come.
But people don't know anything about the philosophy that can be saved from the silence, beauty and integrity of Nobel Puskar BJT Rabindranath Thakur.
Please tell you about this in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that the common man can know it.
In his writings, he has published a unique mark on all things, Rabindranath was a genius, a personality of a strange thought, but he had a teacher in him, can always be felt.
He wrote in Geethanjali: "He who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students, that is, he has the responsibility to share the knowledge with the students.
The entire meaning of keeping the sun is that when the man is insistent on himself, he can feel others hungry.
When he feels thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is the time to recall the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammed.
The education of his life makes us obligations on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a Prophet asked him: "What is the best thing in Islam
The Prophet said, "Bringing poor and underprivileged people and maintaining engagement with all those who are unaware.
Prophet Muhammad was a believer in knowledge and compassion.
He wasn't supposed to be in any case.
He used to say, imagination is the only thing that describes knowledge.
Prophet Mohammed said that if someone has more things than required, then you should give it to someone who needs it. This is why Ramzan has a special significance.
In this sacred month, everyone gave donations to the poor people.
Prophet Mohammed believed that the person's sacred soul was not rich.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the country of Lord Buddha, who has guided millions of people across the globe, of grace, service and sacrifice.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the greatness of his efforts, determination and commitment to the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, sovereignty and brotherhood.
This is the human value that is the most needed today in the whole world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar said that he had a great inspiration from Lord Buddha in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be inscribed in three words
Baba Saheb has empowered the people of this territorial level through the Constitution, whether it is a group of people, suffering, exploited or deprived.
There's nothing more than a great example of the grace.
This blessing of Lord Buddha was one of his greatest qualities for the suffering of mankind.
We have received the education of Lord Buddha in the whole of Asia.
In many countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, this tradition of Buddha is also associated with the rocks of Buddha and that is why we are building the infrastructure of Buddhist tourism which connects important places of South-East Asia with India's special Buddhist regions.
For the entire world, I pray for the blessings of the great men that we can live in their ideals in a peaceful and compassionate worldhood.
Today, we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard of the statue of Lafing Buddha, which says that Lafing Buddha has brought good fortunes, but only a few people know that this co-existence is also associated with an important event in the history of India's protection.
You might be wondering what the relationship between the Lafing Buddha and the Indian army is.
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the 11th of May, 1998, the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, had spoken to the people of the country, which appealed to the entire country on the message of pride, pride and happiness.
There was a new self-confidence amongst the people of India that spread all over the world.
That day was buddhist.
Nuclear tests were conducted on 11th May, 1998 at Pokhran, Rajasthan in the West Bank of India.
This test was done on the day of Buddha Purnima on the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias tests were successful and on one hand, India was able to showcase its strength in science and technology.
We can say that day has been marked in the history of India as an exhibition of its military power.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that inner strength is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when you can become a country, you can stay peacefully with everyone.
The month of May 1998 is not only important that atomic tests were conducted in that month, but the way it was done is more important.
This incident showed the whole world that India has the power to achieve new goals and elevations every day by keeping the great scientists their own land and a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
Today, when we are going to celebrate the 20th year on 11th May, 1998, every young man of the country will have to take part in the task of creating a strong India and a supportive India to build a modern country.
We have to make ourselves a part of Indias energy.
And then we can also achieve a new joy and a new satisfaction to take the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, we will talk again about Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
On 26th January, the representatives of the ASEAN group had come here and brought together various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them have established Ramayana before us.
That is, not only in India but also in the ASEAN clans of the world, the inspiration and influence of Ram and Ramayana is similar today.
My dear countrymen, I have received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and approvals from you every time.
I have read what MyGov has written about the launch of the online course of Komal Chakkar Sanskrit.
I am glad to see your passion towards Sanskrit as an IT worker.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about this.
I urge all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are working with Sanskrit to think about how to take forward this proposal of Komal Chakkar.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar, Varkar village of Nalanda district of Bihar, has been admitted to the Narendra Modi App.
In the context of the decreasing ground water level, the indignation that you have expressed is very important.
And Ayushman Bharat can happen only when we take care of every creature living in this land.
You have requested to keep water for animals and birds in summer.
Shakal ji, you think I've reached all the listener friends.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha said, I would like to say something about the health of the youngsters.
According to him, the youth of our country are physically weaker than other Asian countries.
Just a few days ago, the President of France had visited Kashi, Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi, who wrote that all the sights of the journey have touched his heart and inspired him.
He expressed his interest that all the pictures should be published in the video social media.
The Government of India has shared all the pictures on the social media and the Narendra Modi App.
I'd like to tell all the children like Angha, Jaysh that if these letters were sent to them, my whole day's dash, my hard work would flutter.
All these letters, calls, calls, suggestions, which I have heard and there are many things that have touched my heart.
They wrote about their tests, distributed holiday plans, and in this summer, they also thought of the humidity of animals and birds.
Farmer brothers and sisters have also sent letters to me about the work that is going on in the country with Kisan Mela and farming.
Some conscious citizens have advised me about water conservation.
There are several letters about our culture and traditions during the festival season.
When I read your letters, I know that Ahmed Ali, a registrar of Karimganj in Assam, made nine schools for poor children, filled with his own will, got the identity of the unparalleled will of this country.
When I hear the words of Dr. Ajit Mohan Chowdhury of Kanpur, who visited the footpath and treated the footpaths of the doctor and gave free medicines, he was proud of the harmony and humanity of the country.
Calcutta taxi driver Saidul Laskar's sister died due to lack of timely treatment.
This kind of inspiration is the introduction of my country.
Today, the whole world has seen India in a different way.
Today, when the name of India is highlighted with great respect, the children and children of this country are hidden behind it.
My dear countrymen, the farmers will be very important for the next few months.
Because there's a lot of letters about farming.
This time I have seen the video of the programme that I have discussed with farmers friends on the Doordarshan channel and I am sure this Doordarshan channel should be seen by all the farmers and agricultural suggestions should be used in their fields.
Whether it was Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri Ji or Chaudhary Charan Singh or Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, everybody considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur always emphasized the need for preservation of scientific trees, plants, wilderness etc.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia said that in order to ensure better fertilizer, better settlement system for our farmers and to enhance food and milk production, the public has been awakened.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh emphasized the need for the farmers to use and invent new technology.
Our Mughal farmers have produced records in 2015-16 compared to the previous five years.
They have shown that if the goal remains stable, there is complete self-confidence, if there is a promise then everything can be made possible.
Today, technology has been combined with the hard work of farmers.
This gives greater energy to the agricultural producers.
In the letter that came to me, I saw that many farmer friends had written about MSP and they wanted me to discuss with them in detail in this regard.
Brothers and sisters, a big decision has been taken to give the farmers the cost of crops in this year's budget.
It has been decided that MSP will be reduced to one and a half times for certain crops.
Moreover, there is also a detailed work on the Agricultural Marketing Reform in the country for the farmers' crops.
There is an attempt to connect the rural local market and the pikari market with the world market.
For the farmers not to go far away to sell their produce, it will be linked to the APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading the required infrastructure of 20 thousand rural houses in the country.
This means that a single sector can be connected to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the festival of Mahatma Gandhi is being inaugurated.
How will the country celebrate this festival
Ask you to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What can be the logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was earlier under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health.
Preventive health care is very cheap and easy.
We are aware of the preventive health care, individuals, family and society.
The first term of keeping life healthy is cleanliness.
Besides, work is going on to create a Health Wellness Centre across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity in the world as Private Health Care.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
It is the responsibility of all of us that Yoga has become a mass movement today and has reached home.
This year, the International Day of Yoga is 21st June and there is no 100 days left.
On the last 3rd International Yoga Day, all the people from all over the country and abroad participated with great enthusiasm.
Even today, we have to ensure that we join ourselves and encourage our family members to join us.
In a new and innovative way, it has to be popularized among children, young and adults, men or women.
The country's TV and electronic media are doing different programmes.
But can you create awareness about Yoga as an expedition from now to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
Some people have made me a teacher of Yoga by their own thoughts and have made me a third-D animated video of Yoga.
I want to share this video with you so that we can practice asana and pranayama together.
A lot of effort is being made to ensure that the healthcare is uncomfortable, whether it is cheap and easy for the people.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, where more than 800 medicines have been sold at affordable prices.
More new centres are being opened.
Heart Stents have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The cost of artificial knees has also been reduced to 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in the current 479 medical colleges of the country has been increased to around 68 thousand.
One of the three districts will open a new medical college.
Everyone needs your help to reach this awareness.
To get rid of tuberculosis, we all have to try together.
A few years ago, Dr. Ambedakar spoke of Indian entrepreneurship.
He thinks Shilpman is a strong medium, which will result in the income of the poorest of the poor.
Dr. Ambedkar dreamed: India will once be a strong centre of labour-culture.
Today, when the Makein India initiative is progressing in achieving success all over the country, his dream of visiting is our inspiration.
Indias position in the global economy is now like a bright star, and the highest foreign investment is that of FDI in India.
Globalisation is now looking at India because we are now becoming the centre of investment and new traditions.
Dr. Ambedkar was deeply believed in self-reliance and self-reliance.
One person in the country should not live in poverty. Dr. Ambedkar asked for such a thing.
It was also firmly believed that the poor cannot be exploited by the charity of the poor.
Today, schemes like Mudra Yojana, Start-Up India and Stand-Up India are creating youth-teachers in our country.
As far-reaching people like him said that the rivers and the Valley Management Parliament had conceived that there would be several working committees for water conservation and use.
Today, historical work has been done to expand waterways and ports in the country.
The new ports are being built on different seashores of India and the reforms of old ports are also being done in the same way.
During the 1940s, when the World War II, the World War II, the Cold War between the two powers and the tension of the territory, Dr. Ambedkar imagined the spirit of Tim India or India.
He had understood the importance of federalism or maritimeism and that is why the central and state governments have to work together for the progress of the country.
Today, we have been inspired by the Ministry of Cooperation Federalism and Competitive Cooperation at every level of the country.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for innumerable people like me.
The image of India is totally different: This is an India that is of the pride, which is of the poor and the backward classes.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan will be organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May.
There will be various programmes for rural development, poor and social justice across the country.
I request you to take part in this national campaign.
My dear countrymen, in a few days many festivals and festivals have come: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Ester and Vaishali.
Let Mahavir Jayanti remember Lord Mahavir's sacrifice and penance.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavir, the propagator of arrogance, is inspired by us.
I would like to congratulate all the people of the country.
Ester Elley gives us the idea of Jesus Christ, whoever wanted humanity to be peace, sovereignty, justice, mercy and mercy.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion.
Mann Ki Baat, February, 2018
We've seen that the colour of the sea looks blue, but we know from your daily experience that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever thought that the sea, the water becomes coloured
This question was reminded of a young man in the 1920s.
This question was the generation of a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for the best performers on light scattering or radiation.
His discovery is known as "Raman Effect".
We celebrate the National Science Day on 28th February every year, as it is said that he had discovered Light Scattering on this day, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
Scientists like Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana from the beginning, like Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
The famous particle named Satyendra Nath Bose has also been named as Boson.
Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a function in Mumbai, inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It's very charming to know the best work done in science.
Artificial Intelligence helps in creating a robot, butter and manufactured machines.
Today, through self-fillerning, various machines are making their intelligence smarter.
This technology can help improve the lives of poor, deprived and helpless people.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I wanted scientists to know what kind of artificial intelligence can be found to improve the lives of brothers and sisters.
Can we enjoy a better experience of natural intercourse through artificial intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence facilitate the healthcare of Nagalpawa
Just a few days ago, I had been associated with the Prime Minister of Israel at the inauguration of the I Creat event in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There a new young man said that he has made a digital instrument where if anyone is not able to speak, then the instruments will change in the future and you can talk as you are able to talk to a person who is able to speak.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in such a way.
Science and Technology Volunutral.
You-you're not involved in this.
Any machine we want to do.
But it depends on us how we want to work with machines.
Light Balb's inventor Toms Alva Edison has been unsuccessful in his work.
Once asked about this, he said, "I have explored ten thousand ways of not creating light bulbs," meaning Edison has also made his inadequacy his strength.
It is a matter of great privilege that today I have lived in Aurobindo's programme.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British administration, fought against them and put their rule in the face of questions.
In this way, he tried every aspect of life like a great sage, finding answers and guiding humanity.
It's important to know the truth.
I congratulate all our scientists and scientists on the occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, I got a lot of messages about Safety and Disaster during the contract.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has sent his comments on the Acupational Safety in the Mobile App from Pune.
He writes that in our country, software is not good instead of artillery and construction work.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, if we cannot afford security, then it is even more difficult to ensure a safety system during any major accident or misconception.
Most of the accidents will be seen by the removal of natural evils, but the consequences of our evil-tribulation.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules then we can save our lives and save the society from any major accident.
Sometimes I have noticed that various instructions have been issued for safety in the field of employment, but the rules are not followed at all.
I urge all the municipalities and municipalities who have a fire brigade not once a week, but at least once a month, they will go to different schools and draw their maize to the students.
There will be two benefits - the habit of awakening the Damkal and the new generations will also learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has led the country to deal with corruption.
A scheme called Apada Mitra has been launched to train volunteers in cyclone or wild-clean districts.
Training and awareness are extremely important.
Till two to three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year in Lu or Heat Wave.
After this, NDMA organizes a Workshop on Heat Wave Competition and drives to promote public awareness.
We have a good consequence of the common initiative.
Due to the heat flow in 2017, the number of deaths decreased unexpectedly by around 220.
This means that if we emphasize security then only we can stay safe .
I would like to honor all those who are present at the scene of an accident in the moment and help the victims in rescue operations.
The number of heroes is not less.
Besides, the Risk-ups are always humiliated by Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Forces and the brave soldiers of the Armed Forces who rescued others from the danger of their lives.
A few days ago, India and other BIMSTEC countries, namely Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, participated in the exercise led by India.
We all heard it many times.
But today, if someone asks us about taking our planes, where and where the live jackets are kept, how to use them, etc.
If we all become aware of our safety then the security of the society will also be included in it .
My dear countrymen, for the purpose of creating a Swachh Bharat in this budget, emphasis has been laid on the production of Wasteto Wealth and Wasteto Energy through biogas in villages.
For this, efforts have been made and it has been named GOBAR Dhan, Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of the GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to cleanse the villages and to create energy and energy from the compost and bio-gass the remaining waste in the fields after cattle and cultivation.
Any European country and animal dung and other biological ultimately used for manufacturing energy.
But in India it was still not fully implemented.
Including this in the Mission Rural scheme of Swachh Bharat, we are moving towards this direction respectively.
The objectives are to make use of bio- gas-based power generation of wheat pomegranates, residual waste after agriculture and waste of cooking.
Gobar-Dhan Yojana will encourage farmers, rural brothers and sisters of rural India to see dung and waste not only as waste but also as source of income.
The use of biogas for cooking and power generation will also increase self-reliance.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
There will be new employment opportunities in the areas of waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sale etc.
A online Trading platform will be set up to effectively implement the Govar Dhan scheme which will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers get the right price for global and agricultural waste.
I would like to urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in the village, to come forward and create self-help groups, organize a cooperative society and use this opportunity.
I am inviting you to come and join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs. Be enthusiastic in this endeavor to transform your village's waste into wealth and to create Govar Dhan from the world.
But we got to know about an unparalleled attempt in Raipur of Chhattisgarh and that is the first ' Varjya Mahotsav ' organized in this state .
The Festival, organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation, aimed at enhancing sanitation, creativity of waste materials in the city and creating awareness about various methods of reuse of garbage.
I extend my best wishes to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration there for showcasing the importance of waste management and cleanliness in a new way.
The International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are various kinds of programs in the country and the world .
On that day, women have been honored with the award of women power in the country, who have done incorrect work in different fields in the past few days.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development.
Today, at this moment, my husband, Vivekananda, seems to be a voice.
This idea of Swami ji, a hundred and fifty years ago, expresses the feelings of women power in Indian culture.
Today, the responsibility of all of us is to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
Today, our womens strength has brought about self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They are moving ahead , along with taking the country and society forward and taking it to a new height .
Finally this is the dream of our new India where women are equally involved in the powerful , powerful and universal development of the country .
A few days ago, a man gave me a pretty advice.
He suggested that on 8th March, various kinds of events were organized on the auspicious occasion of Women's Day but what programme can be organized with respect to those mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village-city
This number is not small, 15 lakh women have been organised and they have been campaigning for a month.
In this campaign starting from 26 January , 2018 , in just 20 days , these women have established a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets .
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water-shuai i. e.
You can imagine how big it is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will make the cleanliness drive in everyday life and improve the improvement of cleanliness by forcefully transforming it into a common man .
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching the News that electricity reached three villages of Elephanta Island after seventy years of independence and how much encouraged the people there.
You know that Elephanta island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
It's an important tourist destination.
I am amazed to know that despite being a big center of tourism in Mumbai, electricity has not reached Elephanta even after so many years of independence.
For seventeen years, the three villages of Elephanta Islands - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Saintbandar, the darkness that had blossomed in the lives of the people of that country, have lost their darkness and their lives glorified.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now Elephant village and Elephant Caves will be lighted in the light.
This is not just a power but a new beginning in front of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days back we have celebrated the Shivratri festival.
As a result, the importance of Holika Dahan is as much as the importance of Holisube, the evil is destroyed by burning it on fire.
On the day of Holi, sitting together, enjoying each other, a beautiful moment and a message of love, unity and condolences.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And two days ago, we have celebrated the Republic Day together.
The first time in history was that the top leaders of ten countries were present in the festival.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter to me today in the Narendra Modi App.
He has written that the death anniversary of the spacecraft vision Chawla on Pilla February.
He has eternally taken away from us in the Calambia Space Expedition but has inspired millions of young people in the world.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji for his long-standing imagination of Chawla.
If you want and commit yourself, if you are hungry to show something, nothing is impossible.
Several scientists have played an important role in creating different parts of the country.
Lopalamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi-Mann don't know how many names
Today we talk of 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao', but hundreds of years ago, in our scriptures, it has been said in Scandhapuran - Dasaputra, Samakanya, Dasputra Promotion.
This is the value of women in our society.
And that is why, in our society, women are given the status of strength.
This women's strength keeps the entire country, the entire society and the family in unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has taken several more examples.
He writes, Our adventurous defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman will inspire him to travel on the Sukhoi-30 war plane.
The three brave women Bhadan Kanth, Mohan Singh and Abani Chaturvedi are the drivers of the war, who are currently training to run the Sukhoi-30 war flights.
Today there are many areas where women are living first and our women are showing something or the other.
It has also been added to the website as e-book.
Today, there is a huge threat to women in the ongoing economic changes of the country and society.
Today, when we talk about women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment. You might be wondering what it could have.
The Matunga station of Mumbai is the first railway station in India where all level employees are women.
Women workers in all sections.
Be it the Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Auditor, Announcer and Point Person, more than forty women workers are handling this station.
Today our male power is giving leadership from the front.
Whenever the tribal women talk, a picture comes out in everybody's mind, there will be jungles, mountains, and there will be a familiar sight of the children moving ahead.
But in Chhattisgarh, our tribal women have created a new picture in front of our country.
The Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which falls in the affected areas.
Hings, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere there.
The tribal women living in such a sectarian situation are making their own self-reliant by running e-rickshaws.
Within a very short span of time, all the women from there have participated in this process.
On the one hand, as they are empowering them through self-employment, they are also changing the pictures of the Maoist-affected areas.
Besides everything, it is possible to provide special strength to the environmental protection.
I compliment the district administration and the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women until they are trained.
We are listening repeatedly, people say, "Anything that doesn't lose our existence.
Whatever the negative exclusion, it is forbidden to accept the reforms required.
And the speciality of our society is to continue the continuous process of self-reconsolidation.
The identity of any living society lies in the process of self-reform.
Several centuries of efforts against social misconduct and misconduct are continuing in our country individually and socially.
Through this campaign, efforts are being made to create awareness against social curse like Bali Marriage and Panpradhar.
He was sworn in in the State for fighting corruption like Panprath and Bali Marriage.
The children, the elderly, the youngsters, the mothers and the sisters, who are filled with enthusiasm and provocation, have empowered themselves in this fight.
Beginning from the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human chain continued to cross the borders of the state.
It is necessary for all the people of the society to be free from such evil practices to participate in the real development process.
Come, let us all simultaneously pledge to remove such misconduct from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there, the people of the human race, for their denial of such special and comprehensive issues towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan has written in MyGov from Mysore, Karnataka, six thousand rupees per year for the treatment of his father.
He was not the first to talk about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But as soon as he came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he went to buy medicines and reduced the price by up to 50 percent.
He said that while talking about Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about it so that more and more people get information about it.
Over the past few years, many people have been writing about me.
I have also seen a lot of videos and social media that they are enjoying this scheme.
And when I know this kind of thing, I feel very happy.
Have a deep satisfaction.
And I am also glad that Shri Darshan ji's ideas have come in mind and the benefits he has received will be given to others.
This has helped the common man, especially those who are forced to take medicines every day, financially.
The life-saving medicines from here are made according to the approved value of the World Health Organization.
This is the root cause of good quality medicines getting cheaper.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
Not only this, medicines are getting cheaper but also a new employment opportunities for the private sector.
Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendra and Amrit Stores of Hospital are available at affordable cost.
The only objective behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the country to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, from Maharashtra, Shri Mangesh has shared a picture on the Narendra Modi App.
The picture was such that my attention was drawn towards that picture.
This image was a grandson who joined his grandmother in the Clean Morna River Safai Abhiyan.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola organized a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morna river through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river used to flow for twelve months before , but now the weather is dependent .
The other sad thing is that the river was filled with wild grass and Kachuripanese.
The river and its surroundings were sufficiently dirty.
Hence, an action plan is being constructed and one day before Makar-Anti, the first phase of Mission Clean Mornah is four kilometres away from the corner of the Mornah river at fourteen places.
The Swachhta Abhiyan is also being conducted on 20th January and I am told that until the Morna river is completely cleaned, this campaign will be carried out every Saturday morning.
This means that if people take a stable commitment to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is possible to bring about a big change through public movement.
I congratulate the people of Akula, the people of the district and the administration of Purnigam and all the citizens associated with this work as a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you have also heard a lot of discussions about the Padma Puraskar.
Discussion on the news papers and television has attracted attention.
But if you look at this thing, you will be proud of the fact that how great people are amongst us and it will also be proud of the fact that how the common people of our country are reaching this height without any recommendation.
Every year there is a tradition of giving Padma Puraskar but in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Now a citizen can choose any person.
Cleanliness has come in order to make the entire process online.
It is said that the election process has changed completely.
All those people who are not seen in big cities, newspapers, TVs and programmes.
Now there is no introduction of the person to the awards and the importance of his work is increasing.
You might have heard about Shri Arvind Gupta.
He is creating toys from a four-and-a-half-decade drop-off to enhance the spirit of science among the youngsters.
Their efforts are small to encourage scientific experiments from unemployment.
For this, three thousand schools from different corners of the country are inspiring the children by showing films made in 18 languages.
Such a story is from Sitaba Jodatti, Karnataka.
He is not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, he has done great jobs to transform the lives of countless women in Belagavi.
He dedicated himself to Devdasi at the age of seven but then added his entire life to the welfare of Devdasis.
Not only that, he also worked immensely for the welfare of women.
You can hear the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh and Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family and tribal family.
He worked hard for life, but he was fond of creating traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is honored not only in India but also in the entire philosopher.
His pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The Vice President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced the gathering on the occasion.
You will be surprised to hear the echo of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutti.
Laxmikutti teaches in the area of fort and is still in the midst of the dense forests in the tribal areas in the midst of the shadowed huts .
He made five hundred percent medicines based on his memories.
He has the talent to make snake bites.
Laxmi ji is serving every person with his knowledge about this herbal medicine.
He was awarded Padma Shri for his participation in the society by identifying this ignorant personality.
Today, we want to recall another name, we have been celebrating the 15th anniversary of Subhasshini Mistry in West Bengal.
Subhashani Mistry is a woman who has made utensils in the houses of other people to build a hospital.
When he was thirteen years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated freely in the hospital constructed due to their hard work.
I am sure that there are so many men and women, who don't know, don't know.
Sometimes, in schools, colleges such people should come and know their experiences.
There should be some efforts in society outside the awards.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year on January 9th.
This is the day that the revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa .
Today, we celebrate the festival of Atut Bandhan among Indians living in different parts of the world and Indians.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we have organized a function where all the Indian dynasties and mayors living in different countries of the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in this event, Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and many other Indian genetic parliamentarians and mayor from different countries.
Our Indian descendants who are living in different countries of Europe, who are engaged in cyber security, some are associated with Ayurveda, some are happy with music or poetry.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for the acceptance of Indian genetics and for giving it to the people of the world through them.
On 30th January the revered Bapu had shown us a new path .
These weren't just the original elements.
At present, we can see every step that Bapu's message was justified.
If we take a pledge that we will walk on the path shown by Bapu, what can be more than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by conveying the good wishes of two thousand eighteen years to all of you.
Namaskar .
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
The event of Mann Ki Baat will be the last round of the year and see what a strange event is today, the last day of 2017.
I have shared a lot of things for almost a year this year.
The exchange of your papers, comments and deliberations on the Mann Ki Baat programme always fills me with a new spirit.
And only after a few hours will change the year, but this conversation will continue.
In the last few years, we will share a lot of new experiences.
I congratulate you all for the New Year 2018.
Just a few days ago, the festival of Christmas was celebrated with dust throughout the world.
This festival is celebrated with great fervor throughout India.
During this period of Christmas, we recognise the teachings and advice of Jesus Christ.
This service is also inscribed on the mobile.
Ramkrishna Paramahans ji has also said that Shiva is serving life in knowledge. And all these things are human values all over the world.
Dear Countrymen, this year was Guru Gobind Singh ji's 350th Prakash Parv.
On the one hand, the Guru, the poet, the philosopher, the great warrior, has been inspired by him.
He has taught him to be a straightforward against the injustice, he has shown the path to freedom from the bondage of casteism and religion.
And in this endeavour, Though he had lost many things in his personal life, he never reflected his insolence.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Come, let us commit ourselves to the teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and to the great vision of his life and to adopt his ideals in our lives.
You are surprising to think that New Year comes every time and Pilla Junior comes every time, what happens in this
The entire India is looking forward to welcoming you to the 21st century clerics.
You are also proud of yourself in the 21st century voter history.
The power of the fighting is the greatest strength of democracy.
Because, remember, you can also play an important role in building India in the 21st century and it will start from Pilla Sanwari.
On the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to especially reflect the power of life from 18 to 25 years of age.
My belief is that our dreams of a New India will be fulfilled by depending on the skills and strength of this life-style.
The new India that we are talking about in the coming days is a poison-free India of nationalism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
India free from poverty and poverty.
New India, whose shield power will be peace, unity and understanding.
Take a path for yourself, connect those whom you are associated with yourself, and thus the transformation is prosperous.
Think how we plan ahead of 2022
Mahatma Gandhi gave birth to freedom movement.
My young friends, it is a demand for the time being that we also give the dream of a beautiful and positive India a movement of 21st century.
Today, there are many opportunities for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and interpretation, our youngsters are coming forward and successful.
I would like to assure you how to get the news of these projects at one place of the New India Youth and create such a system in which the age of eighteen can be fulfilled.
Dear countrymen, I had spoken to you about the implementation of the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Nothing is impossible for a person with positive and incentives.
In English, everyone says - Pensymism Leadstu Wickness, Optimism to Power.
I had appealed to the people of Mann Ki Baat to welcome their positive moments in 2017, Shearkurun and a positive atomsphere in 2018.
I am glad that the people have shared their experiences in a large number of social media platforms, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App.
Lakshadweep has been selected with the positive India Hashtag which has reached more than 1.
The transmission of a bio-synergy which has started in India has spread all over the world.
The tourist arsenal was inspiring.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some of the countrymen have discussed the incidents that have had a special impact on the people of this year.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Bihar, Pocket One, Faiz One, Delhi.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra.
And he dies in an accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
With this help of the government, we were very beneficial and we were able to handle the situation.
 My name is satisfying.
Through our villages, the National Highway has been constructed in 2017 from different villages.
The two events that our Indian soldiers have made - one of the surgical strikes made by the Pakistanis, which had laid the foundation stone of the Ugrpanthar launch pad, and at the same time the parallel that our Indian soldiers were found in Doklam was unparalleled.
 My name is Satis Bawani.
For the last forty years, there was a water crisis in our area and we were dependent on the pipeline built for the Navy.
Now we have a pipeline.
So it won't be our bigger in 2017.
In such a way, there are many people who are doing such things at their own level so that there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India which we all are building together.
Let us enter in 2018 with all these small joys and start a new year and take a firm step towards the path of positive India.
When we all talk about positive, I want to share one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspirational story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk, the topper of the administrative service of Kashmir.
He jumped out of the hatred of wrath and hatred and topped the examination of Kashmir's Administrative Service.
You will know that in 1990, the immigrants burned his ancestral house.
There was so much wisdom and violence that his family had to come out of their natives.
The atmosphere of violence around a small child was enough for darkness and taste in the heart, but Anjum did not allow it to happen.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he is not only in Jammu Kashmir but also inspired by the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that however bad the situation may be, the desperate clouds can also be destroyed through a positive work.
Last week, I met some of the daughters of Jammu Kashmir.
As long as I am inspired by those daughters, this is the strength of the country, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to inaugurate the Sabarimala Mandir of Kerala whenever the world famous religious places are discussed.
In this world famous temple, crores of devotees are present every year in the blessings of Lord Ayappasamy.
Wherever such a large number of people come, where such a large number of people come, how many challenges can be faced in cleanliness
And particularly in the mountains and the jungles.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan launched a program called "Punim Punkavnam" and launched a Swachhta Abhiyan to increase awareness about cleanliness.
He is a pilgrimage unless he works hard for cleanliness, his pilgrimage will not be completed.
There is no small distinction in this campaign.
Every pilgrimage is part of the worship of Lord, some or the other way to participate in the cleanliness drive.
Every morning there is a unique sight of this cleanliness and all the pilgrims participate in it.
He may be a celebrity or a rich man or a senior officer or a common pilgrimage- everybody participates in the Poonam Punkavnam program and he has to move forward with cleanliness.
The countrymen have many such examples.
The Swachhta Abhiyan is going on in Sabarimala, the Puranam Punkabhanam is successful and the Swachhta Abhiyan will be attended by the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And we have promised that when Bapu becomes the 150th birth anniversary, India of his dreams will do something to offer a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made in a big way across the country for cleanliness.
A large number of people are participating everywhere in rural and urban areas.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be organised from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the progress of cleanliness at the city level.
This programme will be implemented among about forty-four crore people in more than four thousand cities.
Cleanliness App will analyze for usefulness and revision of service sectors.
It will be seen that every person in the city is involved in the process of keeping the city clean and it becomes the habit of the city.
My dear countrymen, some things look very small, but it becomes far-reaching in a society.
Today, we have mentioned a similar incident in Mann Ki Baat.
This is happening injustice to Muslim women after decades
However, the Muslim women of our country didn't have the right.
I am very happy that our government has taken care of this.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken necessary steps in this regard and has changed the tradition of 70 years old.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to Hajj without Maharam and I feel delighted that now about 1300 Muslim women have requested to go to Hajj and from different parts of the country- from Kerala, Muslim women have expressed their desire to go to Hajj.
I have advised the Ministry of Minority Affairs that those women who want to go to Haj alone should get permission.
Our efforts are to ensure that our women get equal rights like the ancestors and get equal opportunity to take part in the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day of our country.
But on 26th January, 2018, it has to be remembered specially.
It's never happened before in India's history.
The year 2017 was remarkable for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years and 25 years of Indias agreement with the ASEAN-Residents in 2017.
On 26th January, we have great pride in meeting with the ten great leaders of the world.
Dear Countrymen, this is a festival season, however, our country is a country of excellence.
Perhaps there's no day there's no change.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas together, and the new year is coming forward.
New year will bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
We all move forward with new initiatives, new enthusiasts, new hopes and resolves and the country will also move forward.
The sunset takes place in the month of January and the sky is celebrated on the occasion of Makar Sankranti.
It's a festival related to nature.
On the one hand, every aspect of ours is somehow associated with natural fabric, but the way to fulfil these fabrications of nature in our culture with diversity is different.
All these Parvans are shifted from 13th to 17th January.
The name of all these festivals is different but the same element in its depth is the combination of nature and agriculture.
I extend my best wishes to all the citizens for their dedication.
Congratulations to all of you for the New Year 2018
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There is probably no one in India who doesn't remember him carefully or doesn't respect him.
He is a witness to all our commitment and commitment to the nation.
He completed the ninth year on 28th September.
I was fortunate to talk to sister on a foreign trip.
This story was exactly the same as a younger brother speaks with his elder sister.
Modiji: Latadi, Prayer.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
Prayer.
Modi ji: I called for this reason because on your birthday (Lataji yes) Modi ji: "I will be busy traveling on the airways.
I'm late on 28th night, and 29th morning, you're going to pass your birthday.
Okay, okay.
Lota ji: The age is very old but it is great to get the blessings of those who grow up with their own work.
Yes, but I think this is the blessings of my parents and all the listeners.
Modi ji:..
I'm more happy when you proudly say your mother was "gujrati"...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore, because I can see and know how busy you are and how much you work.
How much to think.
When you brought your mother's messenger, I also sent a man to him to bless him.
My mother was also very happy to see you this love.
Once again, my best wishes to you on your birthday.
But it was so busy that I couldn't get up on time.
Yes, yes, very sure
My dear countrymen, with the Navaratri, the festival will once again be filled with inspiration and resolve.
It's the season of the festival
The festival will be happy and glorious throughout the country for the next few weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of this festival.
And this is the blindness of the lamp.
Perhaps this proverb is not just a word, it is an order for us, a philosophy, a motivation.
Think, some rooms are lighting on one side
On the other hand, in front of him, some people are sitting in the house.
Some houses are sweetened, and some houses are sweet for sweets.
At least, more or more delivari-outs of houses can be done.
In many cities, start-ups of young friends of NGOs are doing this.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from the people's house, then find the poor and the poor and get them to swallow the things.
Can we take the darkness under the bottom of the lamp with full awareness and determination in this season of the festival
Laxmi was welcomed in the tradition.
In our culture, daughters are considered Lakshmi because girls bring good luck and prosperity.
This year, can we keep a public programme to honor girls in our society, in villages and cities
Can we keep the programme of honoring these lakhs of Indians on this Deepawali
There are many daughters around us, many widows who are doing excellent work.
Somebody is working to teach poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving society through doctors and engineers and others are trying to justify someone.
Our society will be proud of these girls and respect them.
The programme to honor them will be in the country.
One more thing can be done, share the achievements of these girls in social media as far as possible and use the Hashtagbharatakilaksmi.
As we all launched a massive campaign called Selfie With Dotter, which spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, in the Mann Ki Baat program, I have already said that one of the greatest benefits of this thing is that I am fortunate to talk directly or indirectly to many well-known people.
A few days back, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayang, sent me a very attractive letter.
I am Roeing, in Arunachal Pradesh.
I'm very nice to read, I think I'd be very useful if I read the book before the test.
I am very happy about this book, but I also noticed that there are many suggestions for the students in this book, but there is nothing in this book for the parents and the teachers.
So, look at my young friends as well as the belief that if the country's chief servant talks about any work then it will happen.
My little student friend, first thank you for writing the letter.
Thank you for reading Ekzam Warriors two-three times.
If I can take time for a new edition, I will definitely try to write something for my parents and teachers like yours.
But I'll put an appeal to you all.
Can you help me
I'll surely consider them.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write in my own words.
Maybe if your advice comes in large numbers, then my new edition will be sure.
So I'll wait for your approval.
I once again thank my young student friend Arunachal Alina Tyang.
My dear countrymen, you know about the Prime Minister's work done by the TV, through the news papers and also discuss the busyness of the country.
But you know I'm a common man like you.
I heard that statement and I saw the match.
The simplicity and consequences of the 23-year-old Daniel Madbhadev are like affecting everyone.
I've been impressed.
Just a few moments back, he was awarded 19 Grandslam winners and Tenny's Lagend Rafael Nadal finally.
It would have been sorry and disappointed if anybody else were in that situation.
He lauded his opponent after a strong encounter and set a glittering vision of Sportsman Spirit.
On the other hand, Champion Nadal also praised Daniel's game.
The humility of the sportsperson and the humility of the winner in the same match is both learned.
If you don't listen to Daniel Madbhadev's speech, I'd like to see this video, especially the youth.
It has a lot of learning for all ages and all ages.
There are still moments that are above the defeat of the winners. These moments do not mean the defeat of the winners.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am saying is just for your good.
Tark-widrack, the balance will continue, but the problem should be solved even before it is covered.
Otherwise, the problem takes a giant and solves it is a terrible thing.
If we are aware of the roots, a lot can be saved.
With this idea, I think I should say something about the need of my young friends.
We all know how much harmful the drug addiction of tobacco is for health and it is difficult to leave it once it becomes depressed.
Tobacconicotine drunk.
In adolescence the development of the brain is also harmful because of the start of this tobacco consumption.
We all know about these things, but today I want to inform you about a new thing.
You know, recently the injunction of India-Cigarette has been made.
E-cigarette is an electronic device separate from ordinary cigarette.
In e-cigarettes, a kind of chemical smoke is produced by heating nicotine liquid substances, through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the danger of ordinary cigarettes, but there is a deliberate belief about e-cigarette that it is not harmful.
Aromatic chemicals are used for not smelling like normal cigarettes.
We have seen that even in a family, he tried to smoke in a family that no one else can smoke.
More Chinwadi's little cigarettes, stay away from the beeds.
There is no smoke about the cigarette, those who are selling, those who are buying or seeing, all know that the cigarette is harmful.
But the e-cigarette is very different.
There's very little awareness about this.
The common man is not aware of the harmful aspect of e-cigarettes and that is why the surrender-cigarette has entered the house.
For a long time, in front of the family, children are showing magic sports, without fire, without smoke, I am throwing smoke from the mouth with e-cigarettes, and the elders give up.
You know, we can smell if someone's eating cigarettes around us.
Even a pocket of cigarettes can be smelled.
This is not the case with e-cigarettes. Young people know, unknowingly, or in the facial estate, roam in their own bags, in the middle of the books or in their hands.
Young power is the future of our country.
E-cigarettes have been banned so that this new instrument of intoxication does not affect our country, does not destroy the dreams of the family, does not destroy the lives of the children.
Somehow this drug illness cannot break into the society.
I urge you all to abandon the behavior of tobacco and stop nutrition of any confusion about e-cigarette.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India means not just twice a day in the morning.
The name of saving from all these misunderstandings is also Fit India.
I believe you don't need to worry about me, but it's nice.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great privilege for us that India has dedicated its lives to others, not only for itself, but also for the landscapes of such great personalities.
Our India, our landscapes are enormous.
Many human jewels have gifted this country.
One such humanity is going to be honored in Vatican City on October 13, which is a matter of pride for us all over the country.
That day, Pope Francis, is going to declare Marrium Treasy as St.
Sister Marium Treasy is a reflection of the incomplete contribution made by human welfare in the age of 50 years.
I once again congratulate Sister Marium Treasy and congratulate the Indians, especially my Christian brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world that today, when we are going to celebrate Gandhi 150, and at the same time, 130 crore people have decided to stop the use of single-use plastic.
The way India has played a leading role in environmental protection, the entire world is now looking at India.
I am confident that you all will be involved in the campaign against single use plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this campaign in different ways.
However, a young man in our country has started a unique campaign.
This work attracts my vision and I call him and try to know and understand his new plan.
Maybe his words will help other people of the country.
When I heard the word plogging for the first time, it was new to me too.
Perhaps this word is used a little overseas.
Hello Ripudaman ji, I am telling Narendra Modi.
In this we will not only take care of our health but will also save the health of the mother of the world.
I believe that our country will move 130 crore steps to build a useful plastic free India once in a simultaneous way.
Ripu Daman ji, thank you once more
My dear countrymen, preparations for October 2 are going on throughout the country and around the world, but we want to move towards the path of Gandhi 150.
I want to devote my life to the welfare of the nation.
This is the dream of all of us, and that is why every year on 31st October, we organize a run for unity in the entire country i. e.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022, you went to fifteen places of India.
At least go to 15 places and try to stay there for a night.
You see India, understand, feel it.
We have diversity.
On the occasion of Deepawali, everybody goes on a tour, so I urge you all to visit fifteen places of India.
You will be happy to know that India has improved significantly in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and this is possible due to your cooperation.
This has been done especially because of the importance of visiting.
If we try more then we can achieve one of the worlds largest tourism destinations before 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of this diverse India.
It must also be seen that in the days of Deepawali there is no fire or no harm to anyone.
There was a lot of good wishes once more.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Deepawali's six-day epidemic Chhat is one of the most important festivals in our country with law and order.
From food habits to weavers, everything is followed by traditions.
Chhat Puja is completely associated with the unparalleled nature and the worship of nature.
On the one hand, the Sun and Water, the Centre for Mahaparvachat, on the other hand, bamboo and soil utensils and roots related to its puja system.
This includes the significance of cleanliness in our lives.
Sixteen years ago, the cleanliness of the entire country, along with rivers, ponds, shrines, shrines, shrines, shrines, sweeping and encouraging people together.
Surya Vandana or Chhat Puja - Environment Conservation, Disease Redressal and Discipline.
There is also a logic behind the practice of eating prasad that the fears are destroyed and this imagination that hinders the progress of the person.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am confident that Mann Ki Baat has bound up with the people of the country.
Take examples of Khadi and Handloom.
The only store in KhadiR Handloom is to sell so much, you are enjoyed and satisfied.
During Deepawali, the sale of Khadi Gift Cooper has increased by six hundred and eighty percent.
The Motor Vehicle of Khadi and handicrafts has also increased by about 91 percent this year compared to last year.
It is being seen that today youngsters, elderly and women like every age group of people and handlooms.
I can imagine how many families, poor families and handicrafts have benefited from this.
And we talked about the Khadi for fashion but for some time now, I can tell my heart that after the Khadi for Nation and the Khadi for fashion, the Khadi for transformation is taking the place.
In the lives of the poorest of the poor, the handloom has changed the lives of the poorest of the poor and becomes a powerful instrument to make it more efficient.
He is playing a very important role in rural development.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written in the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my Deepawali experience with the Defence Force and he also wants to know how the defence forces resume.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad also wrote in the Narendra Modi App: "What can our household sweets be accessed to the defence forces
We also think of our brave defence forces.
We also think that the sweets of our homes need to reach the youngsters.
You all have spent Deepawali with very hardships.
Deepawali has experienced a special experience for me.
Once again, I am fortunate to celebrate Deepawali with our brave defence forces deployed in the border.
This time, Deepawali will be unforgettable for me with the defence forces at the Guraj sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our defence forces protect the country by resisting the difficult situations across the border, for the dedication, dedication and departure, I respect each of our defence forces on behalf of the people of the country.
When we get an opportunity, we should know the experiences of our youngsters, we should listen to the pride of the people.
Many of us don't know that our defence forces are playing an important role not only in the border, but also in peace in the whole world.
They are brightening India across the globe by the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Just a few days ago, on 24th October, the United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations in establishing peace in the world.
And we have adopted Vasudhaib Kutumbakam that is, the whole world is our family.
And for this belief, India has been actively contributing towards the various important initiatives of the United Nations.
You will surely know that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with both the words Wi-The Pepple.
India has always emphasized the equal rights of women and the live example of UN Disclosure of Human Rights.
Its initial sentence was All Man and Burn Free and Equivalent, which was replaced by India's representative Hansa Mehta, and followed by Alhiuman Beings and Burn Free and Equivalent.
Although it seems to be a small change, we find a healthy idea.
Indias role in the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations is the most important contribution in the UN Amberla.
In the peace and education mission of the United States, India has always played a big role.
There are many of you who know this for the first time.
Over eighty thousand defence forces have contributed to the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.
At present, nearly seven thousand soldiers of India are associated with the peacekeeping programme of the United Nations and this is the third largest in the world.
By August 2017, about 50 people have contributed to the world's peacekeeping efforts.
These efforts are going on in different parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at the Indian Army Hospital in Kango and southern Sudan and many have been rescued.
The defence forces of India have not only saved the people of the country, but have also enhanced their minds by maintaining peacekeeping.
Indian women played a very important role in the peacekeeping process.
Only a few people know that India is the first country to send the Women Police Unit to the peacekeeping campaign of the United Nations in Liberia.
And look, this move of India has been inspired by all the countries since then.
After that, all the countries started sending their Women Police Units.
You will be proud to note that Indias role is not only limited to peacekeeping but also to train the peacekeeping forces of 85 countries.
From this soil of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our external peacekeepers are conveying the message of peace and prosperity throughout the world.
The peace-security campaign is not very easy.
Our security forces have to go and work in all the remote areas.
They have to know different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the people are very proud.
He was the only member of the Peace Keeper of the United Nations who was respected by Paramvir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchandji, a member of the Indian Peace Keeper, who has also received special recognition of his work in Cyprus.
In 1989, he was appointed Army Commander at the 72-year-old NAMEBIA Abhiyan, who served to ensure the freedom of Namibia.
The former Prime Minister of the Indian Army, Thimayya, led the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations in Cyprus, and deployed his supremacy.
India is always a messenger of peace, unity and sovereignty.
Let us live a peaceful and equitable life and move forward towards building a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage is protected against all the glorious Indians who have served humanity freely.
Sister Nivedita, whom we live in, is also known as Bhagwani Nivedita.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Nobel laureate, later called Swami Vivekananda Navedita.
Navedita means who is completely devoted.
Later, he proved his name's worthy glory.
Yesterday was a hundred and a half of the livelihood.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the poor and the poor.
Sister Nivedita, the thirty-third kingdom would have suffered a lot.
The British tried to ensure that Indians are not only physically but also mentally slavery and slavery.
There was always an attempt to reflect our culture underneath, without reflection.
Bhagwani Nedita reinstated the pride of Indian culture.
Inspired by the national consciousness, awakened and helped people to unite.
He roams around different countries of the world and becomes a witness against the inadequacy of spiritualism and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will be sustainable for his poem 'Pudumi Pen, Newwemen and 'Nari Saktikaran'.
It is said that the source of inspiration was Bhagwani Needita.
BhaginiVedita also helped great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose in many ways.
Through his writings and various conferences, he helped both in examining and publicity.
This is a marvellous composition of India where the spirituality and science of our culture is supplemented by each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose - The beauty of this ideal.
In 1899, the Calcutta महानगर saw a rare plague of fatal plagues in the city, in the year 1998, the human beings fell into the grip of death.
Sister Nivedita ignores her health and comes forward in the Sarasta Ghat and Narma Safai campaign.
This is the lady who left the illusion, ill-health and dissolved herself for the poor and the sorry.
Sister Nivedita, who has given her everything to India, is resting here.
Of course a story is always true.
This will be our perfect determination towards this immense personality if every Indian learns from his life and follows the path of his displayed service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of the creation of a New India, the hero of the next day.
Your inspire is perfect. The diseases that were seen in the old age earlier are being seen in childhood today.
It's surprising that children are also victims of diabetes these days.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are called lifestyledisorders.
The main reason for this disease is the lack of physical labor and change in food habits.
Both society and family need to take care of it.
If we consider this, we don't need an unusual or terrible change.
Whatever is required is to pay attention to small things and under their own practices.
I want the people of the family to make sports habits in the open fields.
If possible, the elders of the family will also share with them.
Children should be used to use stairs instead of lifts.
After dinner, the whole family will walk with the children.
India - Yoga will help in creating a healthy lifestyle habits of our youngsters and prevent livestyledisorders.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can be taught easily.
There's no special equipment or field.
There is a lot of testing in this regard, which is effective in controlling diabetes.
There is also a lot of work in this regard and the results that have been achieved so far are very hopeful.
Ayurveda and Yoga should not only be a disease-free practice but also a part of everyday life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have been happy in the past few days from the world of sports.
Hawki's bedminton is also good for India.
Badminton Star Kidambi Shrikant won the opening of the Golden Market and honoured every Indian.
After Indonesian Open and Australian Open, it won his third super-series.
I congratulate the young man for his success and for his pride in India.
Friends, FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organised this month.
The teams from different countries of the world have come to India to participate in it and have enhanced their sports skills.
I also had a match.
All the audience from the player were very encouraging.
World cup is a big event, where the world looks at you.
I am amazed at the enthusiasm, provocation and inspiration of young players.
The World Cup was organised in the best and successful manner and all teams showcased their best skills.
Even if India is not able to win it, the players of India have concentrated on everyone.
The Festival was celebrated by India and the entire world. The entire football tournament was very entertaining for the fans of football.
The future of football is very bright and its predictions are available.
I once again congratulate all the people, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, if I have to communicate with the people who have written about Swachh Bharat, then I have to make a programme of Mann Ki Baat every day and talk about this cleanliness.
Something is a picture of the efforts of small children and sometimes the achievements of the team of youngsters.
Somewhere there is innovation about cleanliness, somewhere the enthusiasm for the work of an officer becomes innovative.
Just a few days back, I got a big port where the renovation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra is mentioned.
A team of NGO, called Ecological Protection Organization, launched a cleanliness drive in the Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me both before and after Safai.
I am amazed at seeing and I am sure those who have been surrounding the surroundings, who have been surrounding the surroundings, who are thinking about how to clean so much, can see the pictures of this Chandrapur fort.
Your deep desperation, your disbelief will be over.
This Bhagirath Puraskar is a unique example of beauty, commitment and sustainability for cleanliness.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
Historical wealth Safety and Protection are the responsibility of all the people of the country.
I congratulate all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and all the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on November 4th, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanakshuth is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is Jagadguru.
He has spoken of the welfare of the entire humanity and has given this statement equally to all castes and communities.
He emphasized on womens self-respect and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Dev travelled 228 thousand kilometers, and he spread the message of mankind.
He has met the people, has guided them to power, sacrifice and work.
He didn't just say that in his life, in his own work.
He launched the Langarkhana and transmitted service delivery among the people.
Equality and equality get awakened by eating food in Langar.
Guru Nanak has said three means of a positive life.
Guru Nanak also created the Guruvani for the propagation of his speech.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come, let us try to move ahead in life by listening to our words and teachings.
My dear countrymen, and after two days on 31st October, the birthday of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated.
We all know that he had created the plan of modern India.
We can learn a lot from this great child of Bharat Mata.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel worked as a stories to India.
I had assured millions of Indians in the shadow of 'One Nation One Constitution'.
His imagination gave him the power to cross all obstacles.
He has set a target and he has moved ahead with that goal in the entire day.
He said that one who dreams of a nation where all people have equal rights.
I want this statement of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to make us always proud.
He said that we cannot change the variety of castes and communities, and every country of India should define the future of the people of love and mutual love and understanding.
Sardar Saheb's speech is still the inspiration and strength of our New India Vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as National Unity Day.
The contribution of our country to a unique shape is unforgettable.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb will be organised across the country, where children, women, youths and infants will be commended.
I appeal to all of you, all of you, participate in this ideal.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, you have returned to your daily life in a new resolve and a new determination.
My best wishes to all the people of the country for fulfilling their dreams.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2017
Three years have been completed to make Mann Ki Baat through Akashvani.
Today this is the 36th edition.
Most of them encourage me.
And I take you half an hour a month, but people start reaching their points for the thirty days of Mann Ki Baat.
And what is happening due to this is that there is a simple idea of focusing on the sensitivity of the government and the strength of the society far and wide.
And that is why the three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of their thoughts and feelings.
And perhaps in such a short time, I am extremely grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity I have got to understand the feelings of the common people of the country.
In Mann Ki Baat, I often remember that thought of Acharya Binoba.
Acharya Binoba often said, non-government, effective.
I am sure that three years later, sociologists, universities, researchers and media specialists will surely analyze it.
I am confident that this jurisdiction will be very useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, there will be a new consciousness and a new upliftment.
And once I was told in Mann Ki Baat, we should think while eating that we will not destroy it as much as we need.
But then I have seen that such letters have come from every corner of the country, many social organizations and many innovators have been doing this work long ago.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the Selfie With Dotter of a Panchayat Chief in Haryana and I put it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only from India but from all over the world, a huge campaign called Selfie With Doter begins.
Just a few days ago, I was sitting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
Incredible I send the photographs wherever I went to India.
From every corner of India, lakhs of photographs have become a huge wealth for those who work in the tourism sector.
I have realized how many small events create a big movement in Mann Ki Baat.
Today, because when I think it's been three years, how many things have been happening in the last three years.
The country is moving towards the right path every moment.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of society and for the betterment of the country.
On my three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt from the countrymen, I have learned it.
For any country, this is a huge wealth, a big power.
And I have seen that there has been a lot of attraction towards the treasury and I have naturally said that no one has to fall.
But there's a variety of fabrics, isn't it okay
There can be room sheets, rooms, curtains, and it seems that young people have grown up to the treasures.
The sale of khadi has increased and the poor have a direct connection with the employment.
On 2nd October, the Khadi is released and there is a lot of release.
Once again, I would like to say that we will take the campaign for the khadi ahead.
We are working with this idea that we will burn the lamps of Deepawali at the house of the poor by buying Khadi.
The poor people of our country will get strength from this work and we should do it.
In order to enhance the interest of this trenchment, the workers of the Khadi sector and the people associated with the Government of India have been encouraged to think newly.
How to bring new technology, how to enhance manufacturing capabilities, how to bring solar power and handicraft cotton
The old heritage, which had been closed for about 20, 25, 30 years, can be revived.
A Khadi Ashram in Sevapur, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
There's a lot of ways.
Several people have had new employment opportunities.
The Khadi and Village Industries Training Centres, which are closed in Pumpore, Kashmir, have a lot to offer in this regard.
Now, for the resumption of this training centre, new generations are getting help in building, talking and creating new things and I am happy that the gifts given by the big corporate houses during Diwali have started giving food items.
People are offering to each other as gifts.
We all realize how to move ahead easily.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month, we all made a comprehensive resolve and we decided that the 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti, we will celebrate the Swachhta Parv across the country.
We will connect the people with cleanliness.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
Old people, men and women, cities and villages have become part of Swachhta Abhiyan today.
When I talk about the concept, we can see how this cleanliness drive is going on in the path of determination.
I imagine that some people are working to put it on.
This time we saw one more thing - firstly we can clean somewhere, secondly, we cannot make any place unconscious, but if we have to make cleanliness habits then we need a global change in our thoughts.
This time a number of competitions were organized in Swachhta Hi Seva Abhiyan.
More than 1. 25 billion children participated in the composition of cleanliness.
Thousands of children have painted.
They have drawn pictures to express their own imagination about cleanliness.
Whenever I talk of cleanliness, I have never forgotten to express my gratitude to the people of the media.
We see how many people of our country can serve electronic media and print media in the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
Just a few days back, somebody has attracted my attention to the 18-year-old young Vilal Dar of Srinagar.
Since the age of 12-13, till the last 5-6 years, Bilal has been working with sanitation.
The largest lake in Asia near Srinagar is also cleaning plastic, polythene, used bottles and dirty dirt.
I am glad that the mythology has not only made Brand Ambassador, they have given Bilal the car, the uniform.
Children at the age of Children, but those interested in cleanliness are inspiring.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to confess that the history of the future is born in the womb of history and when we talk of history, it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
Sardar Patel from Mahatma Gandhi had born many great men in the month of October, who led us in the 20th and 21st centuries, showed us the path to walk and for the country who suffered a lot.
When former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam Ji spoke to the youngsters, he often talked about the rural development of Bangaji Deshmukh.
He used to mention the programme deeply and he himself went to the village to find out his work.
Remembering these great men, they are not benefitted, we remind them that they find ways ahead so that they get the right direction for the future.
After this, I will definitely say about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Mann Ki Baat.
We are very simple to say that unity between diversity is the speciality of India.
We are proud of diversity, but do we ever try to feel the diversity of ourselves
I want to repeat to all my countrymen in Hindustani, especially to my young generation, that we are in a waking up state.
Recognise the separation of this India, touch it and get the pride of it.
This diversity of our country plays an important role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I don't have any objection, but sometimes you'll see your house
The people of North India don't know what is in South India
Do not know the people of West India what is in the East India
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam Ji and all of them visited India, there was a new inspiration for the country to see, understand and die.
These giants have seen this country widely.
In the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
He tried to make India self-reliant.
Cannot we also learn from different states of our country, the rules of different society or groups, traditions, their dresses, their food habits as a student, understand and livelihood
The value advision in tourism will happen only when we are not only as a visitor but also as a student, we are conscious of accepting, understanding and self-confiding the characteristics of those places.
I got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of my own country.
More than four and a half thousand districts have also experienced dinner.
Today, when I am taking care of this pride in the country, the experience of that journey is very useful for me.
That's why I have special facilities to understand many things.
I would like to appeal to you as well that unity in diversity in this larger India, not only as a slogan but also to achieve this share of our unprecedented strength.
If one kind of new food is eaten every day, it will not be repeated.
This is the greatest strength of our tourism.
I would like you to leave this holiday just for a little while to go out of the house.
Your worry will grow.
And what could be more teachers than the benefits
Generally, from October to March, the time is extensive for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send them pictures too.
Not only the wealth and architecture, but also the people of the country.
Send all the best practices on your journey to Maiguv and send them to the Narendra Modi App.
I am contemplating that if you can be the seven best tourist destinations in your state for the development of tourism industry of India, every Indian should know about these seven things of his state.
If possible, we have to go to seven places.
Can you give any information about this
You see, if all the same states send these information then I will tell the government to scrutinize them and make a publicity about the seven cases that have come from every state.
I mean, how to improve the tourist destination from one way to another.
Similarly, the seven things that you have seen in the entire country are the best, you need to see someone or anyone who wants to go there and you need to know about it, then you must send the names of such seven places of your choice to MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work on this.
The government will accept the decisions made by you in films, films, creations, promotional literature, etc.
Come on, join me.
You can also be a big experience in improving tourism during the month of October to March.
I'm inviting you.
My dear countrymen, as a man, many things touch my heart and drag my heart.
I have a deep influence.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days ago, perhaps you have also been attracted - a surprising example of women power and patriotism.
Indian Army Ltd. Welcome and Nidhi received two brave courtyards, they are excellent bravery.
For this reason, welcoming and funding husbands were martyred to serve mother Bharati.
We can imagine what will happen if the world is lost in this young age
But the martyr Col. Santosh Mahadevi's wife Swati Mahadik has taken this decision against this difficult situation and has joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfill the dream of his husband.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, her husband Mukesh Dubey worked as a hero in the army and when he was martyred for the motherland, his wife's rule decided and he was also admitted to the army.
It is very natural for every countrymen to pay homage to our women and our brave men.
I congratulate these two sisters on their hearts.
They have created a new inspiration and a new consciousness for millions of people of the country.
Many greetings to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between Navratri Festival and Deepawali is also a great opportunity for our young generations.
The World Cup of FIFA Under-17 is coming here.
I believe soccer sounds will be heard all around.
Each generation will be attracted to soccer.
There will be no school college in India where our youngsters will not be able to play football.
Come, when the whole world comes to play on the soil of India, we will also participate in this game in our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri is going on.
Mother Durga's time.
The entire atmosphere is full of sacred smell.
On the auspicious occasion of Navaratri, I congratulate the people of the country and pray to the mother power and our country will reach a new height of success in fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the common people of the country.
Every challenge can be faced by the country.
The country will progress at a fast pace and in 2022, we have started our journey by creating a five-year radical map to achieve the dreams of freedom fighters, the dreams of 125 crore countrymen, our hard work, our sympathies and dreams.
I don't like you all.
Celebrate Festivals and brighten the spirit.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who is dedicated to the unity of the country.
Since ancient times, our ancestors have resisted the public values, arrogance and sympathy with our lives.
Ahingsa Param Dharma - We are listening to it from childhood.
I also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be misrepresented in the name of belief, it can be a communal belief, a belief in political ideology or a belief in a tradition, no one will be blamed for violence.
Nobody has the right to take the law in the name of trust.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar, who has given us the Constitution, has the right to get access to every person.
I want to assure the people of the country that the government or the country will not mislead anyone who is going on the path of violence.
Everyone has to be slaughtered by the law, the law will judge him and the culprit will have to get the sentence.
Even our festivals are diverse.
Many of our festivals are directly connected with farmers and fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first I want to call you 'Machami Dukkaram'.
Yesterday, the Sambhatsi Festival of Jain society has emerged.
During the month of Bhadra, the festival of tourism is celebrated in Jain society.
Sambhari Festival reflects forgiveness, arrogance and friendship.
And it is also called 'Kharma-Vani Festival' and on this day there is a tradition of blessing each other with the name of 'Michhami Dukkdam'.
Besides, we are in our scriptures, forgiveness, forgiveness and forgiveness.
My dear countrymen, now Ganesh Chatti is being celebrated with great enthusiasm and zeal everywhere in India.
And when Ganesh Chaturthi was spoken, the public referendum came to light.
This great festival of Ganesh Chatti lasted 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and purity.
On this occasion, I tell every countrymen that there is a lot of goodwill of democracy.
Now the ONAM festival is being celebrated in Kerala.
ONAM is a major festival of Kerala in the multi-dimensional festival of India.
The Festival is special for its social and cultural importance.
Onam Festival recalls the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has become a center of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I would like to tell the countrymen that like the Navratri festival of Gujarat or the Durga festival of West Bengal, it has become the main attraction of tourism today.
In other festivals of our country, there is also a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what steps we can take in the coming days.
Eid-ul-Juha will be departed after the festival.
I congratulate all the people of Eid-ul-uha and my best wishes.
Festivals and cleanliness in our family life are in part.
The preparation of the festival begins with cleanliness.
It is not new but it is very important to transform cleanliness into a social way.
Cleanliness is not just in our houses, but in every village, in every city, in our state, in our country, this cleanliness and festival will have to be built in a furnace.
My dear countrymen, the definition of modernization is changing.
Nowadays this new demention has become a new parameter.
You will be able to see in YouTube, these days the kids are building a statue of Ganesh with soil at home.
The Swachhta Abhiyan which we launched three years ago was completed on October 2nd, 2019.
In such a situation, officials of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind at Dhannara of Vanaskantha district of Gujarat have carried out 22 flood-affected temples and cleaning and cleaning of 3 mosques.
If this effort to dedicate itself to cleanliness becomes a permanent part of our nature, then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, let me invite you that once again, on October 2, 15 to 20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, we have launched Swachhta Hi Seva as it was said earlier, Jal Seva Prabhu Seva and Swachhta Hi Seva.
Make a clean environment in the entire country.
And whenever we get the opportunity, we find and manage the opportunity.
Give me your job.
Work on the day of the holiday or on Sundays.
Go to the surrounding colonies, go to the nearby village, give it a movement.
I appeal to all NGOs, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, collectors and panchayat chiefs, on the fifteenth day before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, create a clean environment to fulfill the dreams of Gandhiji.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
It has created a department in which you can list your name and name of the family which you have helped in this work after construction of toilets.
Friends from my social media can drive some creative propaganda in the world of Vertual.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, under the Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Abhiyan, can be organised in a short-term film and film-making competition.
You can write links in different languages and there is no limited age of this competition.
Three of the participants will be selected and rewarded at the district level and three at the state level.
I invite you, you can take part in the cleanliness drive.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Hundreds of crores and millions of people have ever sent a message through letters, sometimes through messages or phones, which is an immense achievement and rare wealth to me.
This is a great opportunity for me to know the thoughts and thoughts of the people of the country.
I wait for you more than what you wait for the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I wait very interested, because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, listen, read and know as much as possible.
"Prime Minister, I am speaking from Pune.
I want to tell you about my binding.
He's always trying to help people, but he has a madness I'm surprised to see.
I've been dying with him to buy it once.
He's got a two-week sari kinnel, spending 450 for PETJA.
At the same time, he spent a long time with Autowala for five rupees to go to Mal.
He worked the same while buying vegetables back and saved four-four pieces.
I was so bad.
We spend a lot of money in affordable shops, but we don't trust our workers and brothers for a little money.
My belief, after listening to the topic of this phone, you have decided not to make such a mistake.
Do you think that whenever someone comes to sell or sell things around our house, we work with a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller, sometimes we need auto-rickshaws - whenever we work with a giant, we need to guarantee, we need to guarantee, not to guarantee it.
And when people like us go to eat a big restaurant, don't see what's written in the bill, let's get the money out immediately.
Not only that, I don't want to buy saris in the showroom, but don't stick to work with any poor.
There will be no difference in your life for two rupees, five rupees, but you've ever seen how deep this behavior hurts her mind
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you called such a heart touch and gave me a message.
I am confident that if my countrymen have the habit of doing this with the poor, they will definitely abandon it.
My dear young friends, on August 29, the whole country celebrates the National Sports Day.
This day is the birthday of the great hockey player and Hackey magician Major Dhanchand ji.
His contribution to Hawki is unparalleled.
I recall this because I want our new generations to be associated with sports dust.
Sports can be part of our lives.
If we are the third nation in the world, then we should also keep in mind the sports ground.
Sports means physical fitness, mental allergies, personality enhancing.
Sportspersons from all sides have a great responsibility for mixing hearts.
Young generations of our country will come forward in the field of sports and today in the age of computers, I would like to be aware of the fact that the playing field is more important than the plane station.
Play the FIFA in the computer, but in the field outside, sometimes show the football.
Perhaps a cricket player in the computer, but the joy of playing cricket under the sky in the open field is different.
Today, the situation is such that the kids start looking at the cartoons at a corner of the house, or else the mobile game gets rubbished and then the mother has to say - when will you go out
Time changed, he was a age when Mom told the boy when would you come and today it's the situation that Mom has to say, Dad, when will you go out
Young friends, the Sports Ministry has set up a Sports Talent Survey portal to explore and develop talents in sports sports sports sports sports portals, where children from all over the country who have achieved some achievements in the field of sports can upload their biodas or videos in this portal.
The Sports Ministry will provide training to Silkated Emerging Players and the Ministry will lunch it tomorrow.
Good news for our youngsters is that FIFA And Seventeen World Cup is going to be organized in India from 6th to 28th October.
The world's forty teams are making India their homes.
Come, let us welcome our young guests from the world with the festival of sports, enjoy sports and create an appropriate environment in the country.
When I am talking about the game today, it is reminded that a marvellous incident last week, I want to share it with the people of the country.
I and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas, who had no connection with the sea.
Six daughters of our country who work in the Navy, their emotions, their inspiration will inspire us all.
This six daughters will come across the sea with a small boat - INS Tarini.
The campaign has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama, and they will reach India after several months of travel across the world.
Sometimes it's only forty days.
Sometimes we'll spend thirty days in the water.
This brave six daughters in the midst of the waves of the sea, and this is the first such incident in the world.
There are no Indians who will not be proud of our daughters
I tell you the feelings of these girls, and I told them to share my thoughts with the whole country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their thinking in the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because it's a bravery, it's a matter of your thoughts, and I'm enjoying these girls to you.
My best wishes to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we all celebrate the Teachers' Day.
The birth anniversary of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan Ji.
He was the President but made himself a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a devoted life to education.
Encouraging the spirit of creation among his students and enjoying knowledge.
Can I start a mission mode
When we talk about transformation in our country, just like the mother of the family, we will remember the role of teachers in society.
Teachers play a big role in transformation.
Every teacher is in the life of a student whose transformation worker has been done and we are doing our best.
It will play a big role in the transformation of the country.
Let us move ahead with this mantra Teach to Transform.
My name is Doctor Anna Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and INDIA Research Centre of Howard University.
The project was started on 28th August, 2014 with a dream.
3 years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed tomorrow, 28th August.
30 crore Indians have participated in the project and opened their first bank account.
The number of new account holders is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If you're in the house or in the pocket, you're gonna have to spend money.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has brought about about 65 thousand crore rupees to the poor people of our country.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, those who have opened an account have also got the facility of insurance.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, with only one and three rupees premium, has created new self-confidence in the lives of those poor people today.
In many families, when this poor person has been shocked, the family chief died, the profit of a premium is getting two lakh rupees.
I am happy to note that the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, Rupay Kard, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, and the benefits of the common man for the insurance.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you, 'Michami Dukkaram'
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
The minds of the people are such that the rainy season is very pleasant to the people.
Animals, vegetation and nature - everybody gets excited at the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a terrible look, it can be understood how much the destructive power of water is.
Nature is our livelihood, our clerk, but sometimes the natural misery like flood, earthquake, its terrible nature becomes very devastating.
There is a positive impact on the changes in weather and circulation.
In the last few days, we have to face natural calamities due to heavy rains in some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal.
The whole of the devastated area is under investigation.
Extensive rescue operations are underway.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are reaching.
The state government is also making every effort to help the people who have been killed in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and civil servants are making every effort to help people in this situation.
Agriculture, Animals, Infrastructure, Electricity, Communications etc.
We have formulated schemes to ensure that the farmers' clinics can be swiftly supplied, especially for the loss of crops and fields of our farmers.
People are talking about their far-reaching.
Prior to the rainy season, the entire government programme was drilled in most of the places.
The team of NDRF was appointed.
Gradually, we have also created us in such a way that we will work as per the predictions of the rain so that we can get rid of the losses.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of my country are more than me.
This time, GST has received such letters, so many phones have come, and people are still expressing happiness over GST, asking questions.
A call I would like to listen to you: "Namskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am calling Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I am extremely impressed by your speech at the Chartered Accountant Day.
That is why in our country, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has started today.
I'd like to listen to you.
Thank you.
The GST is almost a month after its launch and its positive results are visible.
And I am glad that whenever a poor man writes a letter, how the price of the poor is reduced for GST, the goods are cheaper.
Anyone living in the forests, the North-East, the remote mountainous region, in the forests, tells in a letter that the first thing was not feared, but now when I understand it, I feel that the work has become very easier than before.
Business has become very simple.
And the biggest thing is that customers are increasing trust among businessmen.
Now I am seeing the impact of GST on the Transport and Logistics Sector.
How the truck's emerged.
As a result, there is a strong smooth transition that has been immigration, a new registration and a new belief is being created across the country.
And sometimes, the efficient person of the economy, the efficient person of the management, the pundit of technology, through their research, the use of GST in India will definitely be a model for the world.
This will be a case study for various universities of the world.
Because such a big change in such a large scale, the contribution of such a million people in this country, its experiments and success in such a large country, it is a summit of success.
The world will surely study it.
GST has been used, each state has participated in it, and every state has its responsibility.
All decisions have been taken by all the States and the Unions together.
And this is the primary goal of every government that the GST does not put pressure on the poor.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the ministries, all the departments, central and state governments associated with this work.
GST is an excellent example of the achievements of the overall strength of India.
This is an historical achievement.
Such a social reform campaign.
Once again, I salute crores of people of crores of people to achieve such a great effort in a very inner manner.
My dear countrymen, August Movement.
Yusuf Meh's Ali.
Our new generation enlightenment took place on August 9, 1942.
In 1857 to 1942, how they had to face, how they had to face, how they had to face with the expectation of Indian immigrant independence, our inspiration to create an excellent India in the addresses of history.
This was the time when every corner of the country, everywhere in the city and everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, every poor, everybody, everywhere, everybody, everywhere, everywhere, everybody, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everybody, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians dedicated their lives to the struggle in the 'Karange Ya Marang' mantra.
After the Mahatma Gandhi called the Bharat Leave Movement on 9th August, the British had enrolled all the big leaders and then came forward with the movement.
Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan are the leaders of the second generation.
Mahatma Gandhi's two different forms were displayed in the 1920 non-cooperation movement and the uit India movement in 1942.
The faces of the unemployment movement were similar, then the situation arose in 42 years and the rapidity of the movement grew so much that the great men like Mahatma Gandhi also gave the mantra in Karang Yamreng.
Following all these achievements were Jan Sabha, Jan Sabha, Jan Sankalp and Jan Sangh.
The whole country was fighting together that day.
Sometimes I thought that by collecting the leaves of history, it is understood that India's first freedom struggle was in 1857.
The war, which began in 1857, has been in some or the other part of the country till 1942 and in this long time it has created a strong demand for freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everybody is committed to doing something.
The generations have changed, but the rapidity of their determination is nothing.
Some people have come, they have joined the struggle, they have come up with a new team, they have joined the same struggle and have tried every moment to save the British empire.
From 1857 to 1942, this attempt brought the movement to an extreme boundary in 1942 and the Vision of Bharatchoda was played in such a way that it could be transformed into English in 1947.
Between 1857 and 1942, the freedom fighters had reached every country and from 1942 to 1947, this five years of resolution became the reason for the independence of the country.
These five years were the founder.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
We were free in 1947 and today in 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
The government has come.
The policy has been evolved, it has changed, it has been evolved.
Everyone has made their own efforts to solve the problems of the country.
In order to increase the income of the common man in the country, continuous efforts are being made to overcome poverty.
The expectation has increased.
On 15th August, 2017, we will be celebrating the launch of Sankalp Parv and when 75 years of independence will be achieved in 2022, we will also achieve the same commitment.
Since 1942 to 5 years of independence, since 2017 to 2022, this five years of Indias future generation can be a decisive year and it has to be done.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
A conclave that we will enhance in the next five years.
Come, use technology and bring forward video posts, blogs, registrations and new ideas.
This movement has to be the form of a people's movement.
The uit India uiz competition for young friends will also be held at the Narendra Modi App.
This uiz competition is an attempt to inform the youngsters of the country of the glorious history and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am glad that there has been a lot of proposals from every corner of the country about what should be discussed in the last three years on 15th August.
I will try to discuss these proposals as long as I get 15th August.
I'll finish it in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I'm talking about another thing today.
India is broadly connected with the economy of India.
It's never gonna be flawed.
Our festivals and festivals are not just for joy and happiness.
Our festivals and festivals, in fact, the campaign for social reform is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poorest of the country with each of our festivals.
A few days later, Rakhi Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Akram Ganesh Festival, Chauth Chandra, Anantha Chaturthi, Durga Puja, Deepawali etc. will come together and this time the poor people will get some opportunity to earn money.
This is a comfortable joy.
Just a few months before the Rakhi Bandhan Years, hundreds of families have become a small family business.
There are several types of silver and silk, and today people like to keep homemade.
Thus, hundreds of thousands of businessmen are associated with a festival.
Build small soil lamps, but Deepawali is directly related to those poor families.
Today, when I talk about the economy of the festivals, festivals and the poor people associated with it, I want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I think that the people of the country are more aware and active than me and I have achieved that.
Aware citizens have written a letter to me about the last one month.
They have appealed to me that whenever I talk about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chatti so that people like Ganesh, make plans.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition and this year, the 125th anniversary of the Republic of Ganesh.
125 years and 125 crore countrymen.
Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh Festival was inaugurated keeping in mind the spirit of social unity, awakening society and social reforms.
Come, let us also remember that this year, during the Ganesh Festival, we also organize the Rachana Race, Conclave etc.
Come, let us enjoy this festival with the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals can be the economic festival of the poor and the enjoyment of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the coming years.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching that in education, in the field of economics, in the social sector, in the field of sports, our daughters are brightening the country and reaching the top of new success.
Our countrymen are proud of our rivers and we are proud of them.
Just a few days back, we have shown great humility in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
This week I had the opportunity to meet these players.
They had a mark on their faces.
I told those girls that I had a different valuation.
I have seen that if the players of India are unsuccessful, then the anger of the people of the country also falls on the players.
Some people tell us something that is very painful.
Not all this, the girls have done it, they have respected it.
I have seen a beautiful change in this, and I have told these girls that you see, this is only your privilege.
Match Jitun or Jitun, you have won the hearts of 1. 25 billion people.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the names of the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I want to remind you of the August movement.
Every countrymen, every countrymen, every country can guide their five years to fulfill their dreams.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
The future of the country will continue to grow further.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
Weather changes.
This time it was too hot.
But it is fortunate that the rainy season is following its footprints.
Weather has started in some parts of the country.
After the rains, it feels comfortable from the heat of the past.
We all have seen that however encouraging or wrath in personal life or in public life, the arrival of the rains changes our mental conditions.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath Dev is being celebrated with great enthusiasm and joy in different parts of the country.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated in some other places of the world.
The poor people of the country are particularly associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
Only a few people know that there is a word in English language ' Juggernaut' which means a beautiful chariot whose speed can not be stopped.
It is indicative that this word has come from Jagannath ji.
This means that the people of the world have accepted the importance of this journey of Jagannath in their own way.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us all take the country forward by deliberating upon the satisfaction of this sacred festival.
In the month of Ramzan, we found a very inspirational meeting of the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he is a thousand Muslim brothers and sisters.
Everyone in this Ramzan month decided to build toilets together.
The assistance provided by the government for making personal toilets is Rs. 17 lakhs.
You will be surprised to note that in this sacred month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters of that place have returned the amount of Rs. 17 lakh to the government.
This will cost Rs. 17 lakhs for other services.
On this auspicious occasion of social development, I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur for this holy month of Ramzan.
Everything is very inspiring.
The biggest thing is that they have made Mubarakpur a defecation free place.
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - have already been declared defecation free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared as defecation free.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration and the people of the five states for completing this work.
We know very well that we have to work hard to do some good work in personal life or social life.
If it's wrong to write my hand, it has to be done carefully for a long time.
This is how physical and mental changes come.
Cleanliness is the same.
Some bad habits have become usual.
Everybody has to draw attention.
Remember the inspirational events again and again.
I am happy that cleanliness is no longer just a government programme.
It is taking the form of a movement of the common people in the society.
When people associated with the administration take this task forward with the participation of the people, the power grows very normally.
I remember a good incident in the past, which I want to tell you.
The incident took place in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their target was to construct 71 gram panchayats in 100 hours and to construct 1000 family toilets.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and local administration together have completed the task of constructing ten thousand toilets in 100 hours.
71 thousand villages have become defecation free.
In-A, through letters, all these suggestions come from the sky.
It is important to be aware of democracy and that is why it is necessary to recall the incidents of injury to democracy and encourage public awareness.
On June 25, 1975, a black day that cannot be forgotten by any Indian democracy.
The entire country was transformed into a single prison.
The voices of the opponents were closed.
Delegates of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were imprisoned.
Judgment wasn't relieved of that terrible situation.
The newspaper was completely inappropriate.
Today's journalists, students and people working on democracy, recall the black day and reiterate their commitment to enhancing the awareness of democracy and this effort should continue.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
Atal ji wrote a poem throughout the year and described the mental condition of those poems.
We have to make this heritage more powerful.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the whole world became Yoga.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the rays of sun through yoga in the morning.
There is no Indian who will not be proud of it
It is not that Yoga had not been practiced earlier but today when Yoga has been tied up in the context of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have made their achievements of Yoga.
On the one hand, where China has focused on the Great Wall of China, on the other hand, people have practiced Peru's World Heritage Site at a height of 2,400 meters above the sea level.
IFFILE TOwer's shadow in France.
More than four thousand people have joined Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
The India-Afghan Friendship Dam in Herat, Afghanistan has given a new gift of friendship to India by combining it on Salmabandha.
In a small country like Singapore, seventy-seven places have been organized and they have conducted a campaign throughout the week.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, has released 10 postal stamps on International Yoga Day.
Yoga session has been organised in the ranking of Yoga Specialists in the headquarter of the United Nations.
The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has greeted the people of the world on the auspicious occasion.
Once again, Yoga has created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 5000 people have joined together and created a world record.
I also have the opportunity to attend the Yoga event in Lucknow.
But for the first time I am fortunate to join the rain.
Our soldiers have also practiced Yoga in Siachen where they live in twelve, thirty and forty degrees.
Be it our armed forces, be it BS-F, I-T-B-P, C-R-P-Fhoke, C-I-S-F, everybody has joined hands with their commitment.
On the occasion of Yoga Day, I said that three generations, since it was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that three generations of the family together shared their photos.
Some TV channels took this thing further.
I got a lot of photographs in this regard, some of them have been selected by the Narendra Modi App.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit a very dear one.
There has been a good function in Kerala for a few days, the initiative of P P Pennicker Foundation has created a habit of reading among the people, people are encouraging the reading of books, so the Reading Day and Reading Manth are being celebrated.
My chance was to go to the beginning, and I was told there that we don't break the flower, give the book.
I'm glad.
This time I also remembered the fact that I had moved away from the center of my attention.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I made a ritual in the government that we will not break, or we will welcome it with romance.
He'll be romantic to the Khadi's grown-up.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of everyone, but after coming here, I've lost that habit.
But go back to Kerala and wake up the habit.
And I'm starting to notice the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
The age of flower breaks is very low.
One time you have to take it from your hand.
But if you give the book, it's a part of the house, it's a family member.
When I went to London, Britain's queen, ueen Elizabeth, invited me to dinner.
How many years have passed, but ueen Elizabeth has taken care of the role played by Mahatma Gandhi.
And she showed me very happy to go.
When I was watching, I didn't know if he wanted me to touch.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi has become part of his life and has become part of his history.
I believe that these habits don't change overnight and sometimes there is a criticism.
But despite this, such things should be highlighted and efforts should be made.
Now I can't say that I went somewhere and somebody broke the flower, so I won't tell her, I can't do it.
But anyway, there will be discussions, but it will change slowly.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of work to become the Prime Minister.
The files have to be drowned, but I have made my own habit, and I have made some of the letters that I get and thus get an opportunity to connect with the common people.
Different kinds of people write letters.
Well, we've read a letter before. I know you.
A housewife from Tamil Nadu, far south, Aurulmozhi has written a letter.
What are you writing in this letter - I thought of doing something to handle my world, to handle children's studies, so that there is a financial supplement in the world.
Similarly, I started lending something from the bank in the Mudra Yojana and started lending some goods from the market.
In the meanwhile, I heard that the government has implemented a system called the Government e-Marketplace.
So I've registered myself with the search.
Anyone who wants to supply any goods to the government, may be electric bulbs, may ask for supply of dustbins, may be Jhandu, Chairs and tables - you have to register whatever you want to sell.
He wrote, Firstly I got rid of the Mudra Yojana and started my business and then I registered all my sales goods in the E-GEM and then I got the order from the PMO.
It was an unknown news to me, I wanted to know what PMO wanted to buy
He told me that he had purchased double thermos and got 1600 payments.
Yes, this is Emporation.
There is a transparency, development and an increase in the entrepreneurship.
GovernmentE-Marketplace - GEM
I want those who want to sell something to the government, their numbers are increasing.
I understand that this is a unique example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and its aim is Minimum Price and Excellence, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, as we can take pride in Yoga and on the other hand, we can take pride in the achievements that come in Space Science.
This is the speciality of India. Yoga is connected to the soil of our country and our country is also in remote space expeditions.
Earlier, India had achieved great success in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on space.
The twelve days ago, ISRO has launched 30 NANOSATELites with Cartosat-2 series satellites.
Apart from India, about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America have joined the satellites.
And from these NANO satellites of India, farming sectors and farmers will also get a lot of benefits in the prevalence of natural misery.
Just a few days ago, we all remember that ISRO successfully launched GSAT-19.
Think about how much our scientists have achieved in space research.
On 19th June, a thousand days of Mars Mission.
You all remember, for this Mars Mission, we were successfully setting up at Orbit and its period was fixed for six months.
It was 6 months old.
But what extraordinary skills of our scientists have crossed a thousand days after six months.
This one thousand days of our scientific journey is a great achievement in our space research.
In the field of sports and sports, our younger generations are brightening their skills and their physical capabilities with their integral means.
Indonesia and Spain, Indias badminton player Kidambi Champion has grown the country.
I congratulate Shrikanth and his coach on this occasion.
T.
Sportspersons play an important role in development.
Sports plays an important role in the development of the world's personality.
There is no shortage of representatives in the country.
If the family's boys and girls are swinging towards sports, they should be neglected.
Once again, the people of the country, the joy of celebrating the festivals and the rainy season gives special importance to this time.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
Today, when I talk to you, the Holy Ramzan month has started.
On the auspicious Ramadan, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of the world, especially the people of the Muslim community in this holy month.
During Ramadan, special emphasis is given to prayers, spirituality and kindness.
We are very fortunate to be the Indians. Our forefathers have created a tradition that the Indians can proud.
We can proudly commemorate 150 crore Indians that India is among the people of all the world.
It is a nation that believers or novelists who worshipped the idols or those who oppose the idols, every kind of thoughts, every kind of puja, every kind of tradition, every kind of traditional person has tricked to live together.
And religion, culture, thoughts or traditions, whateversoever, gives us a single message - peace, unity and sovereign thinking.
This sacred Ramzan will help in furthering this stream of peace, unity and sovereignty.
I'm greetings once again.
Last time when I had done Mann Ki Baat, I used to use a word, especially the youngsters used to say that to do something new, to come out of the comfort zone with a new experience.
And this age is a little risking, a lot of hardships.
I'm glad many people gave me foodback.
Everyone encouraged me to speak my own word personally.
There are so many messages that I can't read everything, I can't even hear the message sent to everyone.
But what I have seen in my eyes, someone is trying to learn songs, someone is listening to a new musical instrument, someone is trying to learn new things using YouTube, someone is learning new languages, someone is learning dancing, someone is learning dancing, someone has written that they have written poetry.
My reading habits were almost closed.
That's why I tried to read this holiday.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles have to be fought for the benefit of freedom, how many freedom fighters have spent years in prison.
Bhagwat Singh, who has done a lot of things at a young age, has been inspired by his life.
Therefore, I request you to tell you something about this today.
I am happy that today's youngsters are expressing their desire to know about our history, our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for our country.
A few years ago, I went to Andaman and Nicobar.
I went to see the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar had written the book "Manji Janmath" in jail.
He wrote poems on the walls of the prison.
He was locked in a small room.
How hard it was for freedom.
When I read Savarkar Ji's Manji Janmath, I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
There's a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
There is no state of Hindustan, there is no language-speaking person who has not enjoyed black money for freedom, has lost his life in the Cellular Jail of Andaman.
If you get the opportunity, you will definitely go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday.
And this year the theme of United Nations is Connecting People to Nature.
In other words ' bak to basics ' .
And who else is better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi repeatedly said, "One musst care out world will not see", that is, our duty is to think about it, be aware of the world we have not seen.
After being very tired, the windows and doors of the house are opened and breathed in the fresh air.
When we are connected with the five elements in which our body is formed, then there is a new life and new upliftment in our body.
We all saw it, but we didn't think about it.
After this, you must see that whenever you get Yoga with different natural conditions, there will be a new consciousness within you.
And that is why we should have our own expeditions across the world to connect with nature on June 5.
We find some of the results that our ancestors have done to protect the environment.
If we save the environment, we will find the following generations.
The world and the environment are considered to be the source of energy.
We are told here - Mother Earth: Son Ahm Prithiba:
The sacredness amongst us is for our land.
The earth is our mother and we are her son.
If we think of Lord Buddha then one thing comes out that the birth of Lord Buddha, his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana were all three in the trees.
But we need to link it with modern debates.
This time, I got information from different states.
With the coming of monsoon, a big campaign to plant trees in almost all the states begins.
Crores of trees are planted.
The whole world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
Within a short span of time, the World Yoga Day has expanded all over the country, people are contributing.
On the one hand, the world Yoga Day is one of the major contributions of India.
Through Yoga, we have bound the entire world in a way.
Just as Yoga is connecting the body, mind, intellect and soul together, Yoga is also connecting the world today.
In this situation, Yoga has a great role to play in providing stress-free life.
Yoga is not only a exercise but it is also a healthiness that can be experienced in the combination of body , mind , judgement and this combination is possible through the only yoga exercise .
Two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
A funny proposal.
He said, This is the third International Yoga Day, I request that on this third International Yoga Day, three generations of the same family do yoga exercise.
Be it maternal grandmother or grandmother, maternalmother, son-daughter should work together for three generations and upload the pictures.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, a lucky combination of Yoga will show a new direction.
I am thankful for this proposal and I believe that as we have launched the campaign of selfie with Daughter, and made a pleasant feeling, the pictures of these three generations of Yoga will create lights in the entire country and the world.
You must send a picture to me in MyGov through the Narendra Modi App, where three generations of people are doing yoga together.
It will be a picture of tomorrow, today and tomorrow, which will be a beautiful guarantee.
I'm inviting you all.
About three weeks of International Yoga Divas.
Start your practice from today.
You should also spread about three weeks of restless Yoga, spread and integrate people.
This is the movement of a kind of private health care.
I invite you all to participate in this.
From the day you served me as the chief servant, and from the Red Fort I had the opportunity to talk about my first 15th August, I told you about cleanliness.
From that day onwards, I have been visiting different parts of India.
Today, in Modi ji, TV and social media, I have seen that everywhere you are going, everybody is paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have accepted your invitation as a mission of cleanliness.
Children are also aware of cleanliness with the elders.
Many times the youngsters saved them by watching the bigger jewellery .
The cleanliness that you started from the Kashi Ghat has taken the face of an movement through your inspiration.
You are rightly saying that wherever I am going, government cleaning work is done, but nowadays a festival of cleanliness starts in society.
But when this phone call came, I also thought and saw that yes, it's all right.
There will be rest of the preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but cleanliness will be the first.
It will give joy to any Swachhta charming person.
I would like to thank everyone for emphasizing this cleanliness.
Someone gave me a proposal.
Well, it's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can't do it.
Modi ji, when you go to an invitation, tell me, if you invite me, then how kind of cleanliness will be, how many tons of journals will you give me, I will fix my journey on that basis.
Deafness is very good, but I have to think.
Sometimes it's okay that movements should be made, and instead of other things, some tons of jungles will be cleaned.
How many people will we save from sickness.
How big humanity will work.
Once we can consider it as wealth, we will have a new way of waste management.
The youngsters associated with start-ups will come forward with new schemes and create new instruments.
It is expected that in these four thousand cities, the dry waste will be blown in the blue Dustbin-A and wet waste green Dustbin.
Get the waste of kitchen , like the skin of vegetables , skin , eggs , leaves of trees and plants .
If these things look like agriculture, if the color of the food is green then it will be remembered what to do with the green Dustbin.
And other wastes such as unnecessary papers, iron, card boards, glasses, clothing, plastics, polythene, rubber and other metal dry wastes - which are not usually used in the machines, should be used in blue Dustbin.
I believe that we can create such a habit, if we have to take new steps for cleanliness then we can fulfill the dream of Gandhiji's cleanliness.
Today, I want to express my pride that if a person takes a dig at it, then how big a movement can be created.
Cleanliness is one such thing.
In the past, you have heard a news and today a clean and clean Barsova Beach of Mumbai has turned into a magnificent Barsova Beach.
But it's not sudden that a citizen has changed the picture of the Barsova beach by working for 80-90 weeks, removing thousands of tons of dirt and making the Barsova beach clean, clean and beautiful.
And Versova Residence Volunteer took full responsibility for this.
An individual, Shriman Afroz Shah, will be empowered from October 2015, and gradually many more people are involved in this work and it takes the form of a mass movement.
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Afroz Shah has been awarded for this work.
The first Indian to be awarded the Champions of the Earth Award.
I realized that the local women gave the most leadership to this work.
In order to create awareness amongst the people, they have gathered with a mosquito, every street, every household and everybody has been inspired by this work.
I congratulate all these mothers and sisters.
I congratulate the administrators of Jammu and Kashmir for making a block open defecation free.
My dear countrymen, there has been a continuous discussion on the work done by the present government in the last three years in the papers, on various TV channels and social media.
Three years ago you served me as the chief servant.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I am also thankful to all those people who have given critical and important feedback, who have got the opportunity to get the opportunity to improve their work in the wake of misunderstanding, deficiency etc.
For an awakening nation, this criticism is very important for an aware nation.
My dear countrymen, I am as well as a common citizen like you, because of this the impact on the minds of a common citizen is the same in my mind as well.
Hundreds of families have written this to me.
As a common man, it has a special effect on my mind as a common citizen, this incident has encouraged me.
I'm grateful to Akbar Sahib.
Come, let us all move ahead in this environment in love with nature.
I congratulate you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And we have the desire to do something great for the children, the desire to do something great for the youth, the goodwill of the elderly.
Every time the inputs for Mann Ki Baat are enumerated by the government.
What kind of complaints, what kind of people feel, etc.
On the whole, the nature of the people is to give advice to others.
By the train, if someone wants to go to the bus, then do it immediately.
But when I tried to see them carefully, I was unhappy.
In most cases, those people have suggested, tried to reach me, who have actually done something in their lives.
They tried to do some good work according to their intelligence, strength, capability and opportunity.
And when I realized it, I thought all these suggestions weren't normal.
It's all from the feelings of the people.
Some people think that wherever they are working, where they are going to work, if they are listening to those things then there can be a vast pattern of it and it can benefit many people.
Not only this, when I mention something, I remember all this and I am very happy.
I have never been wondering that in our country, especially for a long time, we have been working in this regard.
For a few years, I knew that some social organizations have been working in this regard, but I can know that even my young generations have been working in this regard.
Many have sent me a video.
There are many places where the roti bank is running.
People accumulate their roti in the roti bank, accumulate vegetables, and those who are poor, collect them for themselves.
Those who are giving it, they like it, and those who are not even small.
This is an example of how it works through cooperation in society.
The last day of April.
Paula Me was recognized as Gujarat and Maharashtra.
I am extremely grateful to the people of both the states on this occasion.
The two states have worked towards achieving a new goal of development and have been working towards improving the country.
And both the states continue to inspire the great men and their lives in every field of society.
On the occasion of the inauguration of the two states, we should imagine that our state, our country, our society, our city and our families should reach a height of 75 years after the independence.
The plans should be taken to transform this resolve and all citizens should further enhance their cooperation in this task.
It's time to feel the heat of our country in March-April.
When I was suggesting people in Mann Ki Baat, I used to suggest more and more what to do in this summer and people gave it.
It's not new, but it's useful to re-consume it at a particular time.
And I see that the children of the family are doing this work very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, they go to see whether they have water in their plates ten times a day.
And see if the birds are here.
I think this is a game, but it's a strange way to awaken the sadness of the boys.
In our country, we live together in the form of animals and birds, in colour, in colour and in colour, there should be more emphasis on concerted efforts to preserve them.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a hundred years of Sayedana Sahib, a religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Samaj, was completed.
He lived for 103 years.
And for his hundred years, he has launched a big campaign to save the slaves through the Bohra Samaj Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate this expedition.
About a thousand bird feeders spread them to the corner of the world.
This campaign has been set up in Guineas Book of World Records.
Sometimes I was surprised to know that those who come to my house with news papers, milk, vegetables, postman, I forgot to give them some water in summer days.
Young friends, I want to talk to you too.
Sometimes I feel that some of our young people have a feeling of enjoying life from the comfort zone.
Their parents also resonated in their accomplices.
Some people go through extreme opponents, but most people live this life.
Now the test is over and a number of plans have been made to enjoy holidays.
It's pretty funny if you get warm.
But I want to talk about how to take your holiday as friends.
My belief is that some people will use my words and tell me.
Sometimes there is a difference between watching something on TV, reading or listening to those who know it and feeling it on their own.
The test-examination may be right, just a little out of the restzone.
We're a medieval family, a happy family.
What friends, have you ever wondered that the train's second class jumped into the room and traveled 24 hours without preserving the seat.
Sometimes feel it, I'm not saying repeat it, but once or half.
In the evening, carrying your football, carrying a valiball or other surgeons to a very poor settlement.
Play yourself with those poor boys, you will see, you will feel that you have never enjoyed this game in life.
When you have the opportunity to interact with such children living in society, do you think that there will be a big change in the lives of those children
This experience will tell you a lot.
Many voluntary organizations are doing this service.
Sometimes many summer camps are organized for personality development and many developments can be included in this.
If you are taking part in the Samaar campaign, personality development, you go to those people of the society who are deprived of these surveys and learn what you have learned.
You can learn how to do this.
We are constrained that technology has also come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are six people in the same house, but the difference between them has increased so much as imagination.
Everyone is busy using a new technology.
To live together is a reform, unity is power.
Secondly, I want to say with skills, you don't want to learn something new
Let us lose ourselves to make good results. We get filled with some coaching classes in the weekend.
Sometimes we're scared, our young generations are not robots.
A little more emphasis can be made to improve skills.
Somebody learns musical instruments, somebody or somebody else, Tamil, Telegu, Assam, Bengal, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi, and somebody will find some friends in our country if they look at the differences.
If you don't know, swim, pick up pictures, it's probably not a good picture, but you can try to swim in the paper.
You're gonna learn to drive a car... sometimes you want to learn to drive a auto-rickshaw
You can see this new experiment, its skills will give you happiness and you will get rid of the enormous bonds that have tied life.
Get out of mythological life, do something, friends.
This is the chance to live.
You're wondering if all the exams are over, I'll learn when they go to the new career, but there will be no chance.
And then you're gonna be in trouble, so I'll tell you, if you're gonna learn your magic, then at least learn the magic.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know something that you don't know, you must be beneficial.
The human qualities inside you will be awakened and many steps will be made to improve.
I am telling my experience, we cannot imagine the world as much as we can learn and understand.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new areas.
But whenever we are going to go, the rituals and rituals of that place and the joy of seeing, understanding, discussion among the people, asking, then the joy of seeing the new place increases.
Stay at the same place for four days.
Go back to another place and stay for three days.
You can learn from it.
Where did you go
You can share your experiences using the Hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a great opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They started believing in the digital currency.
But if someone else reflects or focusses on someone else and the new person reflects the money three times, you will get an amount of Rs.
Your account will get ten rupees from the government.
If you get 20 people in a day, you'll get 200 rupees in the evening.
Businessmen may also get income, students may also get income.
This scheme is on 14th October. This will be your obligation to create a digital India.
Now the red carpet has gone, so no one can say that the red carpet in the heart is probably out.
I had an interesting phone call.
Through this phone, it has also expressed apprehensions, but this phone indicates that the common people did not like it at all, they felt a distance.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am saying Shiva Chaube from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I want to tell you something about the government's Red Baken Light Bain.
I don't have to bury the traffic jam, and I don't have to wait for anyone.
I want to thank you very much for this myth.
Grandfathers are also cleaning up. Thank you for this.
The Government is a part of the carriage liquidation.
But we have to be conscious of this idea.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that our history, our culture and our heritage have to be remembered repeatedly.
With this, we accumulate strength, get inspiration.
This year, we are greetings of Saint Ramnujacharya.
It is considered enough to celebrate centenary in other countries of the world, but India is such an ancient country that it has the opportunity to recall thousands of years or more old memories.
Thousands of years ago, he had struggled with the officers of entering their temples and succeeded.
We are so fortunate that some of the great men have been born in the country to break the evils of all ages.
We can take inspiration from Santaranjujcharya to take the soul of the power that is devoted to social unity while celebrating the culmination of Santaranjujcharya.
The Government of India will release a postage stamp in memory of Saint Peala May tomorrow.
I recall Santaramanujacharya with respect, I salute him.
Dear Countrymen, there is another significance of the date of Pyla May tomorrow.
In many places of the world, this day is celebrated as 'Ashram Diwas'.
And when it comes to working day, it is natural for me to remember the story of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Very few people knew that today we are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the help of the workers who have achieved their comfort and respect.
Babasaheb's role in the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I am talking about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramnujacharya, I also remember the great saint and socialist Jagatguru Vasaveshwar of Karnataka in the twentieth century.
In the twentieth century, he spoke comfortably about the labour and the workers in Kannada.
He spoke in Kannada, Kay Kay Kay Kailas.
This means, through your hard work, you can reach Shiva's Alaikailas.
Today, when I talk to the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattupant Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, just a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
All the Buddhists of the world celebrate the festival that day.
And in India, the journey from the war to the Buddha is a unique symbol in the life of greatest Ashoka.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
The cooperation between the neighbouring countries of India will continue and develop them.
Internationally, several projects are under progress.
On 5th May, India will launch the South Asia Satellite.
The facilities provided by this satellite will be specially helpful in the economic and other developmental areas of South Asian countries.
These include mapping of natural resources, telemedicine, education, information technology and people-to-people linkages and this satellite of South Asia will help our entire development.
An important initiative from India towards enhancing cooperation with South Asia is an invaluable example of our commitment to South Asia.
I congratulate all those countries in South Asia that are engaged in this South Asian Satellite project for their special efforts.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
Most families are busy testing their children every corner of the country.
Those who have been tested have some comfortable environment and those families are still under pressure where the test is going on.
But at a time, I will say that listen to the words that I had spoken to the students in Mann Ki Baat last time.
You're gonna need those things at the time of the test.
Today, 26th March.
On 26th March, Bangladesh Independence Day.
Historical war against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh led by Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I extend my best wishes to the people of Bangladesh for their freedom.
And I would like to assure the Bangladeshi people that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will contribute towards peace, security and development in the entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memory, the heritage of both our countries.
Bangladesh National Music is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One of the most attractive information about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first person of Asia to be honored with the Nobel Prize but also the British gave him the title of Nighthood.
And when in 1919 the British had killed a jalianwala Bagh, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who had been sworn in revenge and this time when a child of twelve years had a deep impact on this incident.
The boy's life was a new face in the field. The murderous murder of Jallian Walbagh.
And in 1919, that boy Bhagwad, who is 12 years old, is our beloved, inspired by all of us - martyr Bhagwat Singh.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh and his partner Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that on 23rd March, there was no fear of death in the face of Bhagwat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
They sacrificed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
And those three braves are still our inspiration.
We cannot describe the sacrifices of Lord Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The whole British administration was afraid of these three young men.
They were imprisoned in the prison, on the day of the fucking fucking fuckin' fucking fuckin' fuckin', but what could be done about them, the British were confused.
And so, on 24th March, when the fucking fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' on 23rd.
It's hiding, it's not normal.
And then their dead bodies were brought to Punjab today and the British quietly burnt.
Many years ago when I got the opportunity to go there, I felt the vibration of that land.
And I would like to tell the youngsters of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to go to Punjab, go to the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagwat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt.
At this time, freedom fighters, their intensity and zeal continued to grow.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth of the Armed Revolution.
On the other hand, just 100 years before today, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had saluted Champaran.
This year, hundreds of years of Champaran Satyagraha are completed.
Gandhi thoughts and Gandhi style in the freedom struggle of India have been seen in Champaran for the first time.
This was a bit of change in the entire freedom movement, especially from the perspective of the rituals of the struggle.
This festival, Satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, Hartal of the workers of the factory in Ahmedabad and all these were witnessing the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and style of work.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot valuate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the picture of Mahatma Gandhi.
Just imagine that one person who returned to Hindustan in 1915 had worked only for two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was the same where Mahatma Gandhis organizational strategy, the power to know the nerves and nerves of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the impoverished and unknowing persons against the British administration, to create, to inspire, to bring them to the battlefield.
Therefore, we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Gandhi a hundred years ago, that Champaran Satyagraha says that it is a matter of deep study for a person to enter the organs of life.
We can learn from him how to work and how to work and how Gandhi did it.
And that was the time when the Tabd Tabd leaders, whom we heard, be it Rajendra Babu, be it Acharya Kripalani, Gandhi sent everyone to the village.
On the one hand if the jail is filled then on the other hand put it on its own in constructive work .
There was a strange balance between Gandhi's style of functioning.
What can be the meaning of Satyagraha, what can be unsuccessful, what can be the meaning of untouchability in front of such a large empire - Gandhi presented a complete new ideal not only through words but through successful presentations.
Everybody is happy in the hearts of the people. The great efforts to showcase this mantra for the country, for the sake of the society will fulfill the dreams of those great people who have lived for the freedom of the country.
And in this 21st century there is an Indian who does not want to change, who do not want to participate in the progress of the country.
This will give the seeds of a New India-New India.
There are many people who go to the hospital regularly to serve the patients.
Our country is the service of Ratnagrava and Jansevai Prabhu - this idea is our birthplace.
If we look at this idea in an organized manner, then we can understand how big strength it is.
If there is a discussion on India-Ra, it is very natural and inevitable that there will be different opinions and perspectives.
But it is also true that if the entire country takes a determined step towards fulfilling it then the dream of a New India can be achieved.
It is not necessary that the logistics work has to be done in the budget or government expenditure.
If every citizen imagines that they follow the traffic rules, follow their own devotions, stop the use of petrol and diesel at least one day in a week, then we will take this small steps to create a New India.
I would like to see the dreams of India fulfilled, and I would like to say that everybody should follow their citizens' religion.
Similarly, the creation of a New India can be started.
In the year 2022, India will be celebrating the 150th anniversary of Independence.
I invite you, come, make yourself self-sufficient and determined and participate in this journey from Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I also wish to express my gratitude to you.
The BHIM App was started two and a half months ago, but almost half a million people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot even imagine that you can be a big partner for the country. You can defend yourselves against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, Digidhan Mela was organised for public education and awareness.
About 125 lakh people have received fixed awards for the beneficiaries and seventeen thousand people have received fixed awards for the businessmen.
Come in this endeavour to reduce cash transactions and use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that whenever I want your advice for Mann Ki Baat, there will be considerations.
But I have suggested that there is no lack of interest in cleanliness.
I think cleanliness is necessary to explain to the common man.
I'm going every day across a river, where people lose a lot of dirt and polluted the river.
This river is coming through Rispna bridge and our house is passing through .
To keep this river clean, I went to the neighborhood and talked to the people, mixed it, but it didn't matter.
I would like to urge you to send a team here or publish it through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, you can see how hard a girl from eleventh class is suffering.
He's so crazy to see the filthy shit in the river
I think it's a good signal.
I want 125 crore people to be angry with the people of the country.
Once there is anger, unsatisfaction and jealousy, we can do something in the campaign against evil.
It's a good thing that Gayatri has expressed his anger, has advised me and once said that he tried a lot but failed.
Since the movement of cleanliness started, awareness has increased.
Everyone is associated with it in a positive way.
It took the form of a movement.
The hatred towards evil is slowly growing.
People should be aware, actively participate, movements should be their own importance.
This movement is possible in accurate way.
It's hard, but we have to do it.
I am confident that the awareness that has come from the youth, the youth, the boys, the students, the youth, indicates a positive outcome.
Today, those who are listening to my Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell the people of the country that the words of Gayatri are the words of all of us.
It doesn't get half of the stomach, and it's just throwing it out.
Sometimes we've seen how much we waste the unread food.
Have you ever seen that if you don't waste, then how poor people can fill the stomach.
There's nothing to understand about this.
Normally when the mother presents food to the child in our house , tell us that take as much food as you can eat .
There are some efforts in this marvel, but despite this, sadness in this regard is a matter of social inconvenience.
It's injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there is support then the family will also get financial benefits.
The thoughts are good for the society , but this is such that families will also be benefitted by it .
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to raise awareness.
I know some young people who are associated with this kind of movement.
This kind of work is done by the young people of our country.
Such people will be found somewhere in all the states of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we don't waste food.
We'll take as much, as we eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep the plate a little empty , keep the belly a little empty .
When it comes to health only then it is said that on 7th April ' World Health Day ' .
The United Nations has set a "Universal Health Coverage" (Universal Health for All) target by 2030.
This time, the United Nations has focused on the depression on World Health Day on 7th April.
According to a survey, more than fifteen crore people in the world are victims of depression.
The problem is a lot of people around us, but we don't understand it, and perhaps I feel embarrassed to talk about it openly.
I want to tell my countrymen, there is no depression that cannot be liberated from it.
He starts getting rid of a psychological circulation.
First of all, it is necessary to expedite the mismanagement without suppressing it.
With your friends, with your parents, with your brothers and sisters, tell the teacher what is happening within you.
Did you ever think why that man was doing this
You must be sure, these are the first symptoms of depression.
If someone wants to stay away from the middle of everyone, keep in mind - don't let him go alone.
Let him stay with whom he likes to live.
Encourage him to speak openly in the words of Hai-Hullod joke.
In diseases like diabetes, such as physical weakening, depression reduces the sensitivity of the people, reduces courage, reduces the strength of fighting life and destroys all our lives.
Your self-confidence will come back if you start to solve other problems with the minds of service.
If you can enjoy yourself with others, you can serve and do it unnecessarily, see if your heart is lightened.
Yoga practices, but the best way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is an extremely effective solution for liberation from mental stress, liberation from tiredness and happiness.
The International Day of Yoga is celebrated every year on 21st June.
If you have to make some suggestions on the International Day of Yoga, send me all these thoughts through my mobile app, show me the way.
As much as you can write poetry and songs with yoga, keep writing so that there can be an inspiration among the common people.
Now I'm telling my mothers and sisters, we have a lot of talk about health care.
Just a few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
That is why the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
During the pregnancy of working women, during childbirth and after childbirth, the maternity leave that was given was 12 weeks earlier.
Only two-three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, wealth of the country will be.
New Year Festival is celebrated in different parts of our country.
New Year Festival is celebrated in Ugadi, Sindhi Chetty Moon in Andhra-Karnataka in Maharashtra, Sanbatsar Puja in Kashmir, Ayodhya, Judi Sheetal in Bihar and Satwani in Magadh.
A large number of countries are diverse in India.
I wish you all the new year.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February, 2017
The roar of the bird brings a joke of despair.
Not only flowers, fruits are also glowing in the branches of trees.
The summer fruits are also seen in the spring.
Similarly, in the field of farming, the farmer is bored with the hope of seeing the yellow flowers of mustard.
The red flower of pulses signals the arrival of Holi.
Amir Khasru gave a very beautiful description of this season.
He writes: The jungle is boiling the mustard, the pulses are boiling, the cockle is calling, the Kuhu-Kuhu.
When the color of happiness in nature touches excellence in the form of a sage, people also enjoy that.
Spring-panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals paint the lives of the people.
And so he said that I say something about 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Shobha ji thank you very much, you have remembered the glorious example of India.
Be it fighting poverty, protecting yourself from illness, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge and technology and science have proved to be their role.
On 15th February, 2017, a glorious day of Indias national life.
Our scientists have raised our heads around the world.
And we know that in a few years ISRO has completed a few unprecedented initiatives.
ISRO has set up a World Record for Space Expedition after the success of sending Mars Mission, Mangalyaan to Mangal Grave.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together to Mahaka.
It is also a matter of great happiness that the 38th sequence of PSLV will be launched.
This is not just Israel but a historic achievement for the entire India.
This cost of ISRO has shown an amazing explanation to the entire world and therefore congratulated the scientists of India for their success in the opening up of the world.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters will know how to use the water resources in our country and how to look at it.
We've sent some photos when we reached the satellite room.
That's what you've started.
It is also a matter of great happiness that our young scientists, our women scientists have led these campaigns.
This rare collaboration between the youth and women is a great pride in the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
For the common people, they have always been deprived of the purpose of using the science of mahakash for the sake of the nation and have been creating new achievements everyday.
The more we appreciate these scientists, their entire team, the less will we appreciate.
Shobhaji and a question have been made about Indias safety.
India has successfully tested the Ballisticinterceptor Missile for Defence.
In the interception technology, the missile has been successfully supplied by packing the missiles of about a hundred kilometres above the soil during its experimental flight.
This is an important achievement in defence.
We are happy when I see a new technology and see a new scientific achievement.
And asking for the development of human life has played a big role.
And whosoever intellectuals do not allow him to ask in the form of an inquiries, he also transmitted his questions and asked for new questions and created a new inquiries.
And that's the reason for the new discovery.
They're not calm until the answer is found.
And if we see the stream of development of human life for thousands of years, we can say that there is no complete breakthrough in this development of human life.
It's impossible to complete.
The universe, the rules of creation, the efforts of the people to know.
New science, new technology is born from it.
And every technology, every new form of science gives birth to a new age.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about science, when we talk about the hard work of the scientists, I remember that this Mann Ki Baat programme has said that young people should be attracted to science.
There are many scientists in the country.
Todays scientists will start a sustainable transformation in the life of the next generation.
In view of the requirements of the common man, when science is researched and discovered, and how the discovery will come into use for the common man, science becomes the greatest.
This is where I saw an innovation to use our daily poor fishermen.
All such innovations were achieved from this competition.
Different services are also being accelerated.
To say technology has become an integral part of life.
The rate of digital transactions in India is increasing.
Especially the youth society is removing digital payments from their mobile phones.
It's a nice symptom.
Lacky Grahak Yojana, Digi Dhan Abhiyan is a huge gathering.
About two months have passed since these two schemes, 15 thousand people are getting a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
A lot of people have got one lakh rupees in this scheme.
More than four thousand businessmen have earned fifty thousand rupees.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi-App, has expressed his happiness that he has received a thousand rupees award in the Laki Grahak Yojana.
And then I am confident that you have to share with Shreeman satisfaction.
I am so happy to know that satisfaction, your name and work has made us all happy.
On the one hand, as he is driving, he has become an Ambassador of the Laki Grahak Yojana.
The passengers of the carriage are also conscious of the digital system and many more have started taking part in the digital system.
A young friend from Maharashtra, Puja, in Namdha, in the form of a postgraduate family, has been using cards, e-wallet, and will discuss his experience with his friends about how happy they are.
One lakh rupees is important for him and he is also encouraging others to take it to a mission.
This work plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money in a way.
Give me a reminder.
Just a few days back, Babasaheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary was defeated.
Remembering him, you also learn to upload at least 125 Bhima.

This year more than 7 crore tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
Our farmers had the last zyrecard, even eight percent more than that.
It's an amazing achievement.
I especially like to thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of the country have listened to the poor and about two and a half lakh hectares of pulses have been grown.
This is not just the production of pulses but it is the biggest service to the poor of the country by the farmers.
My request is that the farmers and brothers of my country have made records of pulses, so they are very thankful to me.
My dear countrymen, some or the other programmes are being undertaken by the government in our country, through the society, through various institutions and organizations.
Something or the otherwise, there is a sense of consciousness towards cleanliness.

They also showed how complicated the toilets of this new system and there is no other complication or embarrassment of mind until it is cleared.
We also work for small sanitation, as we can clean the toilet holes.
A Standard Twoin PitToilet for the family of six members is filled in about five to six years.
Our farmers are well aware of the NPK.
Various government departments and different ways of pursuing cleanliness.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
On the second side of March, the Ministry of Innovation and the Ministry of Jalsampad, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will launch Swachhta Abhiyan.

Every time we learn something new from them.
Be it sports or space science, the girls of our country are not lagging behind in any field.

What is happening in the world, the thoughts of the poor people of the village are reaching me.

Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Maybe our ancestors decorated our climate, economic structure and social system in such a way that there is no sluggishness in social life.
We celebrated a few festivals in the last few days.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Shri Krishna is an individual who has created innovation, inspiration and innovation in every festival even after a thousand years, which is the past of our imagination.
He can be an example of any problem even today, inspiration.
Anyone can find solutions to the present problem of Sri Krishna's life.
On the other hand, such a great personality can be said to be ready to work in the battlefield.
Sometimes, whenever you raise the mountains, you can stop eating so much that you can feel innovation.
Today, when I talk to you, my heart is moving towards both the mouths.
A glimpse cycle-screwed man, another cycle-screwed man.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan left the river Yamuna and settled in the city of Dwarka on the seashore of Gujarat and spent the last days of his life in Delhi on the banks of Mohan Yamuna, born on the seashore.
During that period, a few thousand years ago, Sudarshan Chakra Dhari Mohan used his own intellect, commitment, courage and vision to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi.
The Porbandar beach, which we call today, was born on 2nd October, 1869 at the smaller house of Kirti Mandir, which showcased human history a new path.
He served Mills labourers who were not affordable.
He regarded the service of the poor, the helpless, the hungry and the hungry as the most important duty of life.
He used to serve the leprosy patients in order to prove the misunderstandings of the common people about leprosy so that others were inspired.
Whenever any person is in danger, Mahatma Gandhi used to go away to help him.
He not only emphasized the importance of service but also the importance of self-reliance in service.
The meaning of the word 'SEBA' is only if it is done with joy, then it becomes 'SEBA supreme religion'.
But at the same time, the real pleasure of Swat Sukha is also inspired by this idea of service.
We can easily understand this by studying Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity and humanity were the only thoughts.
Whether it is the Fonics Farm of Africa or the Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he emphasized the importance of Community Building in Social Development in a fundamental manner.
I am extremely fortunate to have the opportunity to pay my respects to Mahatma Gandhi in various fields of work.
Gandhiji also emphasized the importance of serving thinking as well as for organic energy.
We want to use both the ideas of social service and social harmony, community service and community solutions.
Come and go, can we accept it
There is no obstacle in the minds of all those who come in their minds, willingly, in the mindset of the entire dedication, it will be a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Several events, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a wonderful news at this time.
In this, Haripura panels were specially entertained.
You remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhash Chandra Bose was held in the history of the Congress Presidential election.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura session of Congress, Mahatma Gandhi had invited Nandlal Bose, the then President of Shantiniketan, in 1937-38.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through artwork and to showcase this Art World session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artwork decorates our Constitution.
A new introduction to the Constitution.
This church of his art has also immortalised Nandlal Bose along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose observed the villages around Haripura and then created some partial conveyances with rural India.
This precious artwork was discussed in Venice.
Once again, with the congratulations of Gandhi ji for a hundred and fifty years, I appeal to every Indian to make some concepts.
For the country, for the society, something or the other has to be done.
This will be our beautiful, true and true reverence to Bapu.
You must have remembered that for the last few years, we have launched Swachhta Hi Seva campaign across the country two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will start from 11th September.
This time we need to put a special emphasis on plastic.
There is a lot of enthusiasm among the people of the society about this campaign.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have put a placard in the shop, where it is written that the mule will bring it along with your bag.
It can save the money and also showcase its partnership to protect the environment.
On the 2nd of October, when Babapur will leave for a hundred and a half years, I will not only dedicate to India, but will also lay the foundation stone of a new movement against plastic.
I appeal to all the communities of the society, every village, every village, every village, every city and every citizen of the city, every year Gandhi Jayanti will be celebrating this year in a way to get rid of plastic jungles.
Maybe on 2nd October as a special day.
It can be recycle-Okra.
It can also be used as a burning.
There is no need to see here for inspiration, no one bigger than Gandhiji can be inspirational.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is well-defined, a gem of wisdom.
Today, I want to touch a very important thing by a Sanskrit definition, it is a matter written a long time ago, but it still has great significance.
The fools are called stones.
Our culture has greater glory than food.
Even we have transformed food related knowledge into science.
We all need smooth and nutritious food, especially for women and infants.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and entertaining manner.
On the day of the harvest, the sailors of Anganwadi used to gather from all over the country.
These food items were used to prepare hot food for children and women.
He who is donating this has become a conscious citizen and a social worker.
After this, the person dedicated himself to this objective and he became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, in 2010, it was thought that the food processing should provide sufficient food to the child so that people are aware of this.
This is a very important initiative that can be taken everywhere.
In many states people celebrate the Theatre Food Mission.
If a family has a birthday, a good day, a memorable birthday, then the family members go to Anganwadi, schools by making tasty, nutritious food and the family members themselves feed their children and share their enjoyment.
This way, a unique mix of service and happiness can be achieved.
Friends, There are several small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has affected both poor and rich families.
Poshan Abhiyan will be held throughout the country in September.
You must be associated with this campaign, collect information and add new ideas.
If you can save one person from malnutrition, then our country will also be saved from malnutrition.
This time when I am contemplating Mann Ki Baat, I firmly believed that there will be a lot of questions on this matter and that is the case.
As far as I reached last few weeks and those with whom I met, the Man Vs Wild has come up.
Through this episode, I have become united not only with India but with the youth of all the regions of the world.
I have never thought of how many strange things our country and the youth of the world look at.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
That's what I feel.
Tiger, Lion, biography. I am amazed how many people can encourage.
My firm belief is that people now want to know the steps taken by the Climate Justife Oclean Environment in India.
Is this an audit later
Look, there's no mystery.
Some people have questions about this, so I am exposing this mystery.
It's not a mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he used to listen English and this is why the conversation would be very easier and this is the work of technology.
After this show, I noticed that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit Natural and Wildlife - Nature and Wildlife Sanitation.
I've already said, I'm telling you again, you must go North East.
Your heart will be expanded.
From the Red Fort on 15th August, I requested all of you to visit 15 places of India - 100 part of tourism in the next three years. See, discuss, take family, spend some time there.
Your life will spread your thoughts.
Last month, it was fortunate to expose the countrywide census.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it was very hard.
The Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 with tigers.
There was an insistence on reducing the number of tigers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers across the globe by 2022.
But this is a New India where we have achieved the goal very fast.
We doubled the number of tigers here by 2019.
The number of tigers in India has not only increased but also increased the number of projected areas and community reserves.
When I was expressing the lies of the tiger, I also remembered the lion of the Gir forest in Gujarat.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister in Gujarat, the dwellings of lions were narrowed in the forests of Gir.
Their number was decreasing.
We've noticed a lot in Gir.
In 2007, I decided to recruit women guards.
Infrastructure enhances tourism industry.
In the context of nature and wildlife, we focus only on protection or conservation.
This time, we have to think in the context of communications and sensitivity.
My dear countrymen, can we forget the historical address of Swami Vivekananda in September 11, 1893
This young Indian sensitivity awakened the tejaswamy speech among the people of the world.
Where the destitute India was in the tribunal of the world, the world was forced to discover a new India in the words of the great personality Vivekananda in September 11, 1893.
Come, let us build the power that Swami Vivekananda had seen in India.
On this occasion, we are going to launch the Fit India Movement across the country.
We have to keep ourselves fit and make the country fit.
This will be an attractive expedition for the elderly and the elderly.
But today I don't know about this in detail.
Wait for 29 August.
For the Totally Dedicated Plastics on 2nd October.
With all our strength, we will be involved in the campaign to keep the house and its surroundings plastic free.
I am confident that this campaign will create lighting in the social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new spirit, a new resolve and a new energy.
I waited for your message and advice.
Our path is lighted in the spirit of joy and service.
Thank you very much, Namskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the right of the citizens, our commitment to democracy - a reform that will bind the next generation on democracy, aware of the responsibility of democracy and reforms.
But there is no debate on the duty of the citizens and the authority of the citizens in our country as deeply as it should be abandoned, as much as it should be discussed.
I hope that at every level, at every moment, the more emphasis is given on the right.
The Indian Democracy can proceed on both sides of right and duty.
Tomorrow on 30th January, our Pujayabapur Purni Teeth.
On 30th January, we pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country at 11.
As a united society, as a country, on 30th January, at 11th and 2 minutes of reverence, we should become a common practice.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers who have been honored with various bravery awards and their family members.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Surya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Voluntary Seva Medal.
I would like to appeal to the youngsters, especially those who are active in social media, can you do a thing
This time, those who have been honored with this honor, seek the Internet and write a propaganda to their members and get them to your friends.
When we know in detail about their courage, bravery and perseverance, we are astonished as we are proud and inspiration.
On the one hand, when we all were happy with the news of 26th January and inspiredness, our soldiers in Kashmir, who are steadfast in the security of the country, are brave victims of suffocation.
I extend my best wishes to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware that I am constantly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April - these months are the month of testing in every family.
One or two children in the world are tested, but the entire family is under pressure from the test.
There is a very strange psychological atmosphere in every world, where family stress, student stress, teacher stress.
And I have always felt that I should come out of this and that is why I want to talk to the young friends in detail today.
When I announced this, many academics, parents and students sent me a message, asked questions, suggested, expressed concerns and I wanted to share with you today.
I made a message on the telephone from the creation.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but the same question is surely in your mind.
The test must be a pleasure.
It has been laboured throughout the year, this time there is a chance to tell you, it should be a festival of hope and enthusiasm.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a pressure, please.
And when the festival takes place, the best that comes out of us.
At the time of the festival, the society gets the feeling of its energy.
During the examinations, there should be a festival atmosphere in the family, friends and around.
Follow the role of yourself in accomplishing this festival like a team throughout the family. See how soon it changes.
It is true that Kanyakumari from Kashmir, Kanyakumari from Kutch, Arunachal from Amreli for these three-four months are just tests and tests.
The responsibility of each of us is that every year, in this three-four months, in their own way, in the tradition of nij-nij and in the environment of their own family, it will be a festival.
And so I will tell you "Smile More Score More".
And you've seen that when you're enjoying, you feel yourself comfortable when you're laughing, you're very comfortable.
A year ago, what Teacher said in the Classroom, you remember the whole scene.
Sometimes it seems we can't see the exams properly.
Then it seems as if the question of life and death is.
The test meant that you've been studying for the whole year.
J.
Abdel Kalam's bright sight.
He wanted to join the airspace, but he was ungrateful.
Imagine that if he had been disappointed after this failure, would he have been in the midst of a great scientist, would India have met such a President
This has not only resulted in competition among the students, but also increased stress.
I want to know about the present situation of education and the future.
Whatever your real life is - your earnest knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and determination.
You think he's a good doctor, so you need to go to him.
When you go to Namiyukil during a big case, do you look for his marksheet
You can see his experiences, his knowledge and achievements.
That's why sometimes this number gets to the heart of our right path.
Analysis will show that whenever you run for the number, you find the easiest way and concentrate on certain things, but you are becoming unprecedented when you face any problem outside this train.
And that is why sometimes we face failure in life, even if we are grateful to the very best in the test.
Richa has inspired one more thing, that is competition.
It's a very big psychological conflict.
In this case, we can give examples of Sachin Tendulkar.
Friends, in every aspect of life, especially when you are going to examine, look at it, if you were to give two hours to adulterate, have you done it for three hours now
In the past, when you thought it was too late, can you get up at the right time
Shri S.
He helped me like this.
My mother couldn't pass the 10th class tests, but I couldn't have passed the CBSE test if she didn't get her help.
Beautiful, you're right.
You must have noticed that the number of women among those who asked me is more.
If you learn to confess once, then many problems will be solved.
If it doesn't admit, it's the way to solve this problem.
The hope makes the road difficult.
Recognizing the present situation, there is an opportunity to open a new solution.
So accept whatever you have.
Look, you're gonna be free.
We talk about the weight of school bags of small children, but sometimes I don't think the parents' expectations are more than the school bags of the children.
Years ago, a well-known person was in the hospital because of heart attack.
In fact, we go to a sick person and create a fear in his mind about the disease.
I want to tell the parents that sometimes we live with the children.
Did you ever think that in the days of the test, I'd give a smile to the children.
You see the situation will change.
I've got a fun call.
The gentleman didn't want to say his name.
If you hear the phone's details, you'll understand why the person doesn't want to publish his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I have done something in my childhood that I am not going to call my name.
I tried to duplicate my childhood.
I have lost many times in thinking about how to duplicate and how to make arrangements for this.
I could get the same number if I spent that time for studying.
When I tried to duplicate the passers-by, I was caught and I had trouble with many friends around me.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
So where will you reach
Remember, you're looking for your own pathways, creating real obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and using the creative power to find ways to imitate them.
If I talk of sports during the examination, then everyone will say, "How is this Prime Minister
Because the common man thinks that the sportspersons will be unaware of studying.
Besides the brain, the rest of the body should be active.
If you take a break for five minutes, you'll feel that you're in a lot of concentration.
I don't know if everyone likes it like this, but I know about my belief.
Once a folk song singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long did you sleep
I'd like to manage, brother
He said, "Hey, no, you don't say, it's related to your throat to give this statement.
If you sleep properly, you'll get your breakfast hard too.
I never thought of my sleep and sound before.
He gave me a simple bag.
Don't do this forgotten, so your guys will be satisfying me.
Otherwise, on the day the market comes, my parents will be able to see you instead of you.
Then it's gonna work when you are sleeping.
Sportspersons also play a very important role in keeping mind, intelligence and body balanced.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, this year, on 1st February, the Indian Coast Guard will complete forty years.
On this occasion, I congratulate all the personnel and the soldiers of the Coast Guard for their commitment to the nation.
Our Coast Guard has secured its pride amongst the world's first 4 best coach guards in collaboration with 126 fighters and 62 teams built in our country.
The Ministry of Coast Guard is keeping in mind the commitment of Ayam Raksham. Our Coast Guard has always been in accordance with our commitment to protect the sea-border oceanics of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard had planned to keep our seashore clean with their roots and thousands of common people were involved in this work.
Our women pilot officers are in the Coast Guard, and they are also intelligent in handling the command of the Monkey Hovercraft.
Sitturaj.
Saraswati Puja is held on spring-panchami.
For the Architecture of the University, worship is done.
Not just education but also the festival of valour.
This is the inspiration of Devasanti Chola.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of the country on this spring-panchami celebration.
My dear countrymen, the Mann Ki Baat program has been filled with a lot of brilliant thinking.
After my Mann Ki Baat address last month, Mann Ki Baat was heard in regional language.
This great success has been achieved.
This has been written by the countrymen from far off places.
I congratulate them for this self-provoked effort of the Akashwani.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
You're not very good for Christmas.
Today is the day to serve, sacrifice and compassion in your life.
The Revolutionary Jesus said, "Our acceptance is not only beneficial for the poor but for them."
There's a very popular story about this.
Lord Jesus once stood beside a temple trading.
A lot of wealthy people came and donated a lot.
Just after that, a poor widow came and donated two copper money.
On one hand, both of you don't have any money as a piece of copper.
The birth anniversary of Mahamati Madan Mohan Malaviya ji, an ideal and self-confidence of the Indian people, had shown a new direction to the modern education system.
On his birthday, I express my gratitude.
Just two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several developmental works at the heat ground of Malavji in Benaras.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mahammati Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
A cancer centre is being built for the entire region, not only from the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh but also from the benefits of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, the birth anniversary of Prime Minister Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget Atal ji's contribution.
Under his leadership, our country's heads are also high in terms of nuclear power.
Atal ji has established an ideal in every role in the leadership, parliament, minister or Prime Minister.
I salute Atal ji on his birthday and pray to God for health.
I am fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
There's a lot of memories in front of the eyes.
I shared an old video when I visited this morning, and how Atal ji's affection for a small worker would be seen in this video.
As a gift for a long time, all the people of the country are going to benefit from the two schemes.
Everyone wants to understand and learn each other.
In order to promote this, the Government of India is launching a programme to encourage consumers and small businessmen to transform e-payments into a habit to increase the strength of mobile banking.
The programme for incentivizing consumers is: "Laki Grahak Yojana" and "DG-Dhan Abhiyan" (DG-Dhan Abhiyan).
And on 25th December, as a gift of Christmas, one thousand rupees will be deposited in the account of 15 thousand people through the Dr.
Today, not just for one day, this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
15,000 people will receive this award every day.
In 100 days, lakhs of families will receive a gift of crores but those who are eligible for this gift are mobile banking, e-Banking, Aadhaar card, UPI.
Use the digital transactions, such as USSD etc.
The DG-Dhan Abhiyan is for businesses.
As the businessmen will connect themselves with this scheme, they will also connect consumers to cashless their business.
Businessmen will also be awarded separately and the number of awards will be thousands.
Those who can buy more than three thousand rupees will not be able to avail the award.
With the help of the USSD, the poor can sell and sell money through Feature phones and ordinary phones and all of them will get the opportunity to get the awards.
The people of rural areas will be able to win the awards by selling them through AEPS.
The ten or twelve-class kids in your family can teach you this method well.
This is a very simple task like sending the Houts App from the mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to e-payments and online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this process.
Businessmen can easily guess how big this decision is.
Those businessmen who exchange digital transactions will spread online payment systems instead of cash in their business, they will be released on income tax.
I am aware that the Assam government has announced 10 percent reduction by providing Property Tax and Trade License Fe digitally.
The branches of the rural bank have decided that at least 75 percent of their consumers will be paid Rs 50,000 on behalf of the government if at least two digital transactions are made from January to March.
5 lakhs has been announced by the Government of Assam through the Uttam Panchayat for Digi-Transferation.
The Government of Assam has decided to award Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers in the Digital Kisan Shiromani scheme for the farmers who follow the entire digital system for seeds and sarcastics.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all the states that have taken such initiatives.
It's funny that GNFC salar sales increased by 27 percent compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, our daily life is important.
Most of these people are paid money, money for work or payment cash, and we know that workers are also deprived of this.
An amount of Rs. 80 for 100, when it is proposed to be given Rs. 50, and these workers are deprived of many more facilities including health insurance like insurance.
But when cashless payments are made, the money gets straight into the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easier for us.
The country like India should come forward in this regard.
Our youngsters have improved a lot through start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity, our young generation should take the initiatives with new ideas, new technologies and new ways.
We have to take part in the campaign to free the country from black money and financial corruption.
My dear countrymen, I am requesting people before every Mann Ki Baat programme, you have sent your suggestions and your suggestions and this time thousands of suggestions have been received in MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
The authors of the second group, who have raised the importance of this, have given details of the good work, the good work for the betterment of the country, the sacred work for the betterment of the country.
Shriman Gurumani Keobal has written in Mai Ghav: This step is praiseworthy for the loss of black money.
Our discomfort as a citizen is right, but we are happy that we are cooperating in the fight against corruption.
We are playing the role of the army in fighting against corruption, black money etc.
The same idea is coming from all the corners of the country.
We all can feel it.
In fact, they are the fulfilment of the change of agent of Change.
I would like to thank all of you for another reason, not only the difficulties they have suffered, but also those who are trying to deviate the common man.
Not only this, some people have opened their masks with their intellect, power and creativity and have brought the truth to the fore.
I salute this power of the people.
The people are the genius of God, the blessings of the people.
I am grateful to the people of the country for taking part in this greatness against corruption and black money.
I wanted that there should be detailed discussions on political parties and political funding in the Parliament as the fight against corruption and black money.
Those who are shouting that political parties have a lot of skirmishes - they're wrong.
This government is the Government of the Republic of India.
On the other hand, I said on the first day-8, this is a wonderful fight.
There are several more reports coming from the public system.
The success we can achieve is basically due to the awareness of the people.
Can anyone imagine how much the conscious citizens of our country are risking to open their mouths
If you get help, this fight will be very easier.
There's one third of those who are sending me letters, who are many.
They say that Modiji does not stop, do not get tired, take as hard steps as possible.
We have to win this war, there is no question of tiredness.
We have brought it out and we have made the Benami Property Act very strictly.
This law will play his role in the coming days.
Whatever is compulsory for patriots and generosity is our primary duty.
In the past, India has established itself with pride in many sectors in the world economy.
According to World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has reached third place in the Top Properties Host Economies 2016-18.
The Global Competitiveness Report of World Economic Forum (WEF) has improved 32.
Similarly, the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index-2016 has said that India's 19 stanzas are progressing.
Similarly, some other reports are also indicating Indias rapid improvement.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament has created fervour amongst the people of the country.
They have expressed their anger in different ways regarding the procedures of Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their fertility in this regard.
But sometimes it's a good thing, and it's a pleasure.
There has been a good work in the House which has not come to the notice of the common people of the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am glad to say that a bill related to the government is being taken up in Parliament by keeping the goals for the disabled persons.
Our government is responsible for the disabilities.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have strengthened this effort when Para Olympics has won four medals.
This victory has not only enhanced the dignity of the country but also surprised the people of the country.
Like other citizens of the country, our bankrupt brothers and sisters, we have an invaluable wealth and strength.
Today, I am happy that the passage of this Act will provide more employment opportunities for the disabled.
The preservation limit for government jobs has been increased to four percent.
The Act provides special facilities for education, convenience and grievances to the disabled.
The government has enacted this new law according to the vision of the Nation.
A few categories have been created for the persons with disabilities to get proper opportunities and justice for the first time.
Thalassemia, Persons with Persons with Persons with Persons with Persons with Disease of Persons with Disease and Persons with Disease of Persons.
My young friends, news has come from the sports ground in the last few weeks so that we all are proud.
Being Indian, it is natural for us to be proud.
Indian cricket team won Series against England in 4-0.
Some young sportsperformances are very commendable.
TET TET TEVER TET TET THE BATTELLING IN THE BETTED THING THE LIGHT.
My best wishes to all of you.
In Hawki, a good news was found after 15 years.
I congratulate these young friends for their success.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey team.
Last month, our women sportspersons have also achieved great success.
Indian women hockey team won the Asian Champions Trophy and a few days back, the Indian women hockey team won bronze medals in 18 Asia Cups.
I congratulate all the cricket and hockey teams.
My dear countrymen, 2017 is a year of new hope and enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month we all celebrated Deepawali.
Every year like this, I went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the Armed Forces.
I celebrate Deepawali Festival in the higher areas of the Himalayas with the youth of ITB-P.
Every year I go to the border, but this time the experience of Deepawali is completely different.
He was very angry and not only did I see a marvellous response from the countrymen who had sent good wishes to the soldiers with their happiness.
When I saw these things, I'm surprised to know what it's very imaginative.
But, really, we don't feel like this during the festival of Diwali.
On the contrary, it was felt that with 125 crore Indians, I had joined the festival of Deepawali.
Dear countrymen, the inner, happiness, love and happiness that have been transmitted among the soldiers of our army should not be limited to Holi Deepawali alone
I appeal to you, come, as a society, as a nation, as a part of the nature and nature. We will remember the soldiers of our army in some or the other way during any festival or festival.
When the United Nations is united, the strength of the army will also increase by 125 crore.
Just a few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir met me.
He had come here to attend the Panchayat Sammelan.
About 40-50 chiefs from different villages of Kashmir Valley.
It's been a long time to talk.
When they came to know about some claims for the development and development of the villages, the recent situation of the Kashmir Valley, the law and order and the future of the children were also discussed in the general discussion.
A few days back, the boards in Kashmir got frozen and about 95 of the students were sitting in the examination.
In the board exams, I am confident that our children in Jammu Kashmir are eager to develop a bright future through education.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to my parents, parents, teachers and all the rural Prime Ministers for this commitment.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I have asked for a public discussion on Mann Ki Baat this time, I am confessing that everybody has made a proposal.
Everyone wanted me to say something in detail with a note of five hundred thousand rupees.
On the 8th of November, I had spoken of a great campaign for the nation for the proper development of the country.
As I took this decision and I made that decision to you, it was clear that it was not a common decision, it was a difficult step.
At the time of declaring the decision, I warned that the effect of this proposal is so impossible that it takes 50 days to get out of it and then we can move towards normalcy.
It's not easy to recover from the disease that has spread over seventy years.
125 crore Indians have immense pride and full faith in their country that they are committed to empowering the nation.
And that is why we will be successful and whether the workers of the bank and the post office are working in resistance.
And when it comes to dignity, they are becoming more active.
When the local bank employees were ears, they immediately reached the house of the intellectuals.
Not only that, his treatment has been arranged.
I am surprised at this incident.
They're taking various ways to save their black money.
One request, don't play with the poor people to fulfil their injustice.
Your injustice is in the records of the poor people, you are not after the investigation, these poor people will be suffocated, they will suffer.
A lot of strict rules have been made to bring under the purview of Venomy which are being implemented in all areas.
I am a common citizen of District Herda, Tahsil and Village Tirali in Madhya Pradesh.
Your five hundred thousand note bandits are very commendable.
My request is that through Mann Ki Baat, you have welcomed this initiative for the progress of the nation even when the common man faces a lot of problems.
Thank you for your deepest thanks. You said that the day is coming, but no one can think you can take such a big step.
By shutting down the notes of five hundred thousand, you have taught the black markets that are corrupt.
Every citizen of India doesn't have more than this day.
That's why I once again thank you.
When this kind of news is heard through media, common people and government sources, there is a lot of enthusiasm to work.
People went there, and after two-four days, when they returned with the hire, the bill was deleted.
This is the strength of my country, where purity and sacrifice are the mainstreaming religions.
The news that I used to talk about was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world have also learned the use of Tea-Beat.
But I didn't know that there might be a cha-baitk.
I've got a wedding in Surat on November 13.
At this wedding, only tea drinks were organised for the invitees, no other food habits and poultry programmes were organised because they lacked cash money during the closure of the note.
The Martyrs also supported the fact that through such marriages, Bharat Maru and Daksha Paramar of Surat established a philosophy by taking part in the fight against corruption and black money.
As soon as the crisis comes, people find new ways and once again I am seen in the Dhekiyajuli village of Assam on TV.
These tea workers are getting weekly salary from the village and tea workers.
The neighbouring four women collected their purchases together and made two thousand rupees notes.
You know very well that even if the poor people were two days ago, they would have given up at least one.
Every municipality tax is only fifty percent.
But after the announcement on the eighth day, the old notebooks of the people fall into the diamonds of Jamaica.
You will be surprised to know that in a week, there was a collection of thirteen thousand crore rupees.
We are getting such a multiplier, whose direct consequences come to us.
Brothers and sisters, The rural and the farmers are the backbone of our countrys economy.
I would like to congratulate the farmers of the country especially when we are adjusting every citizen because of this change in the economy.
I was calculating this year's seedling.
I am happy to see that in all areas of wheat, pulses or sesame, the number of surplus sales has increased this year compared to last year.
In all the opponents, the farmers have taken new paths.
Some important decisions have been taken by the government, where priority is given to the tribals and the villages.
Some businessmen of our country also create employment opportunities and also contribute towards economic development.
For them, I had made an important decision in the budget last year and the small shopkeepers like the big Mall of the city will also be able to do business for 24 hours and no law will stop them.
Through the Mudra Yojana, sufficient observations have been made to pay their loans.
Millions of rupees have been given to all these small businessmen through the Mudra Yojana, because innumerable people who are associated with this small business continue to have crores of rupees of commercial transactions.
But due to this decision, it is natural for all the small businessmen to face difficulties.
You should also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Make arrangements for POS machines for credit cards and learn how to do business without notice.
You've seen that big malls are trading through technology.
Similarly, a small businessman can also transact the transactions of the car with the help of a common User Friendly Technology.
There's no possibility of an accident. There's a chance to spread.
I request you to join you in creating a cashless society.
You can get the full banking facility on mobile phones for commercial dissemination and can continue business without cash norm transactions.
These are technological solutions that are safe, safe and fast.
I want you to help in achieving this campaign, not only give yourself yourselves, but also my belief that you can lead this change.
I am confident that you will be able to complete all the business transactions of the village through technology.
I also want to tell the workers brothers and sisters that you have a lot of condolences.
It's written in the paper that one pay and what's being given in hand is another.
Whenever you get full-scale, you can see that a man standing outside, has to divide him and becomes a part of his life by forced labour.
Today, in the new system, we have to keep your accounts in the bank, your hardworking money is deposited in the bank so that at least the duty of the mortgage is changed.
You get the full money, no one cuts it.
Today, I specially want to talk to young friends.
We say that India is a country where 65 percent of the population is fifteen years of age.
You, my country's youngsters and youngsters, I know my decision has been disliked by you.
I also know that you have supported this decision.
I also know that you will contribute to this thing in a positive way.
But brothers, you're my real army, real friend.
My armed young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
You have the idea of today's world, not an old generation.
Maybe your elder brother doesn't know so much about your family, Aurma, Kaka-Kakima, Mama-Mummy probably don't know so much.
You know how App Keyginis, Online Banking, Online Ticket Booking.
It's very common for you and you use it.
But today, the greatest thing that the country wants to do is our dream is Cassless Society.
It's true that a hundred percent cashless societies are not possible.
But once we can introduce the Less-Kash Society, the aim of the Cashless Society will not be blind.
And you want active cooperation, time and resolve in this regard. And you will never disappoint me, I know, because we all want to change the lives of the poor people of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities are available for digital banking or mobile banking for the cashless society.
Every bank provides online comfort.
Every bank has its own mobile app in Hindustan.
There's every bunker's wealth.
Walt's whiteness means "E-Manibag".
Various types of cards.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have a y card that was used very little.
The poor people have been using their multitude since the date of 8th. It has increased by about three hundred and fifty percent.
The mobile phones, like pre-paid cards are available, are available for banking expenses.
And this thing is as simple as your Houts Appearance.
There can also be Castransfers in the phones with common features.
Whether it is smoke or vegetarians, milk, news papers, tea, gram sellers, everyone can use it in a way.
And I have also tried to simplify this system.
All the banks are involved in it.
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation who is unaware of all this.
And And Anupnarasbai, I know very well that you are active in this great work.
Whatever kind of active massage you have given in the WhatsApp - Slogan, poetry, story, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and smile, and the creative strength of the young generation in the face of challenges, it seems as if the characteristic of this India is that in some era of war, Gita was born.
Similarly, today, when we are going through such a big change, the basic creativity of yours is evident.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I and my beliefs, you and millions of young people of the country will do this.
Do one thing, you promise that you will be a part of the Castle Society.
Please use the online technologies.
Not only this, every day, half an hour, one hour, two hours and at least ten families will explain how to use this technology, how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money in their accounts, how to provide it to the Dodokander.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You willingly enter this cassette society, you will have to give your leadership to the mass movement that has driven the country from the circumnavigation of the society, the campaign to liberate the people from black money, the campaign to liberate people from corruption and problems.
I invite you- Come, not just support, we have become soldiers of this transformation and have changed.
We will take forward this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where young generations have changed the lifespan of the nation and it will be possible to believe that the changes that have come in the youth and young people have revolutionised them.
A mobile system called M-PESA has been set up in connection with Kenyadog, using technology, M-PESA, and today Africa has brought about a transformation of the entire business in Kenya region.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, once again, I am very keen to tell you that you will take this campaign forward.
Each school, college, university, NC-C, NS-S, inclusively, invites you to do this work at a personal level.
You have seen that the most popular artist Amitabh ji is carrying the cleanliness drive forward.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, through your thoughts and your thoughts, Narendra Modi is reaching the App and keeping me in touch with you.
Now the Mann Ki Baat is being promoted at the time of the dawn, but after the end of this broadcast, it is going to be heard in the foreign language.
I am grateful to the Akashwani, the new initiative that they have taken so that the people of the country will get the opportunity to join the Hindi language.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October, 2016
My dear countrymen, you all are not very good for Deepawali.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated every corner of India with enthusiasm and inspiration.
India is such a country where festivals have been held in some part of the country for 365 days.
We have accepted several changes in the festivals as per the time and society's privileges by ending several festivals.
But in all these things, we can clearly see one thing that in India, the entire journey of the festival throughout the year, its depth, its impact on every person - all this is linked to the same original mantra - to the group.
Through the spread of individuals and individuals, efforts are being made to spread their limited thinking from Periasmaz to the universe.
And it can only be done through this festival.
Sometimes there is a festival in India which means food habits, but there is also a feeling of thinking - which season festival and what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are being produced by the farmers and how to connect those crops with the festivals, what kind of reforms should be taken in the field of disease freeness etc.
Today, the whole world is thinking about the surroundings.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
This tradition of festivals in India strengthens nature and makes every person more happy from boys.
And science has conveyed that whatever changes come in the water of the sea in the full moon and the innumerable moon, which affects the nature and it affects the minds of the people.
So far, our vacations have also been linked with the universe to science and the tradition of the people.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali Festival, as I say, every festival of ours brings a sense of education.
The festival of Deepawali gives a message to the Thamasoma Jyoti Gamaye to light from darkness.
Social injustice: Deepawali is the festival of light from darkness to light in the shadow of personal injustice.
One thing we all know is that every family of the country has been seen on the occasion of Deepawali from riches to rich people or poor poor people.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The government of all the regions of the world, the Parliament, the rulers and all the people of the world will be part of the festival.
The Prime Minister of Singapore shared the pictures of the festival of Deepawali through Instagram with all over the world.
The 16 members of the Parliament of Singapore, after the Indian saris, took the picture out of the Parliament and spread over the social networking site.
And this has been done for Deepawali.
Deepawali Festival is celebrated every road and everywhere in Singapore.
I mean to say this is the festival of Deepawali which inspires everyone from darkness to light.
During Deepawali, news of accidents, fire brigades, news of humiliation is a matter of great concern.
And there is a discomfort that during Deepawali, many doctors went to Deepawali to celebrate Deepawali with the family.
It's not from Khali one day but from Govardhan Puja, Vaifonta, profit-panchami to Kartik Purnima for a long time.
This is a festival that has been going on for four days.
But this is one of the greatest features that gives a deep message to the society.
It is a pleasure that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhat Puja is a festival where the setting sun is worshipped.
There's a very big social message.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you, especially the people of the country, for expressing gratitude to you all.
In the last few months, every soldiers of our army sacrificed everything for our sleeping.
On my birthday, the sacrifice, consumption and hard work of the soldiers of the Army-Security Forces have made a special impression.
And that is why I realized that this Deepawali should be dedicated to the security forces.
I have called upon the people of the country to participate in an event called Sandesh to Solajars.
But today I would like to say that there is no such person in India who does not have unlimited love for the army, the pride of the army and the defence forces.
The way people have expressed it will give more strength to the people of the country.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, how powerful a message of yours gives them.
Be it Indore-Tebatten Police, Assam Rifles, Navy, Navy, Navy or Air Force, or Coast Guard, I cannot call everybody without the idea of how our soldiers are suffering.
When we are celebrating Diwali, some of them are in the desert, some are in the peaks of the Himalayas, some are protecting the art, some are protecting the airport.
I really want to express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Some of the artists who have communicated through the art, some of them have produced pictures, alphabets and cartoons, which Saraswati's blessings have been written by him.
I can imagine how proud it is for my country's youth.
Sandesh to Solajars. What kind of message has come in this hassle
Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has composed a poem, I want to listen to it.
I'm celebrating the festival, comfortably, today I tell you, it's possible that you are.
My dear countrymen, whose father-in-law's house and father-in-law-in-law, a sister, Shivani has sent me a telephone message.
Come on, listen to this family, "Namskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am calling Shivani Mohan.
In this Deepawali, our fountain brothers have been encouraged in the launch of the Sandesh to Soulsars campaign.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father-in-law were Army Officers.
This Sandesh has given special inspiration to all the Army officers who are on the border and all the Army Circle.
I want to say that their wife and the entire family have to accept great sacrifice with the Army Officers and the soldiers.
My dear countrymen, it is a fact that the army personnel are not only guarding the border but they are aware of their awareness in different fields of life.
Whether it is natural calamities or administrative calamities, or to bring back the young man who is in the wrong way, our brave soldiers will be inspired by patriotism in all the fields of life.
This discussion indicates that some families are unable to build households due to lack of money.
Vikas Thakur has shown that 57 families have empowered the Swachhta Abhiyan by paying one thousand rupees from their pockets.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state.
Nobody easily goes there.
These youngsters took their brick kilns, cements and other toilets on their shoulders and reached the wilderness throughout the day.
More than 100 municipalities and corporations have been declared as toilet free in Gujarat.
Ten districts are also in the list.
My dear countrymen, the government has planned several ways and after the first plan, if there is a better plan than that, then the first time has to be removed.
But usually no one pays attention to this matter.
There is no need for kerosene in the houses where there is gas connection, electricity.
But who's looking for the government
I heard that seven or eight districts have been free from kerosene.
The way they have taken this task, I think the entire state will be very smooth and corrosion free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi always guides us all.
Whatever the country will do, however, it will be considered as a vision.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you plan, remember the poor and the weaker sections of the country and then think that what you are going to do will benefit these people.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
Whatever our old thoughts, the difference between the boys and the girls in society has to be overcome.
This opportunity is a testimony to our daughters' discrepancy in the Indian society.
However, lakhs of children are left out of the vaccination programme.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is an expedition involving the elimination of the survivors, which enables children to get rid of terrible diseases.
The village will be dark in the 21st century, it doesn't happen.
In order to liberate the villages from the blind, the pace of electricity reaching the villages is progressing successfully.
The work is going on before the due time.
The efforts are being made to provide smoke relief to 5 crore families and this campaign is also progressing successfully.
Small businessmen, small shopkeepers, vegetables, milk sellers, squirrels, squirrels, squirrels, squirrels, etc.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account - this is a successful campaign to liberate the poor.
Through Aadhaar card, the money is directly reaching the bank and direct financial benefits are being provided to the real earners.
It's time for the common man to get rid of the murder of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great men of this country showcased the unity of India, which was the original mantra of life and the generation of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the prestigious ancestors of the solidarity of the country, and the death anniversary of Smt.
You know that on 31st October, the birthday of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel is a person who has given up for the integrity of his entire life and I believe that he has succeeded in this direction.
He has collected Sakal, and we can say the misfortune of the country or say that Gandhi was killed that day.
And we all know what happened in the country after his assassination.
Your Excellency, I want to tell you how to stop such a terrible incident.
Dear countrymen, this sadness is not of anybody.
One Sardar-Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the history is a witness to this house. After the wishes, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job to unite the country.
But it is also a sad heart that Sardar Saheb had sacrificed his life for unity, fought, was the main objective of unity of the country, so many had been dissatisfied because of this, but never left the unity.
But on the birth anniversary of that Sardar, thousands of Sardars, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars, have been brought to death after the assassination of Smt.
On the birth anniversary of the great men who spent their entire life for unity, this page of history hurts us all.
But in this crisis, the mantra of unity has to be taken forward.
The only strength of the country is in diversity.
There are many languages, nations, nutritions, food habits, but unity among these diversities - this is the strength of India, the speciality of India.
Every generation has the responsibility, every government has the responsibility, the example of unity in every corner of the country, the principle of unity in the country.
With the spirit of discrimination, we should save ourselves and our country.
Sardar Saheb has demonstrated our 'One India' and it is our responsibility to create the best India.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the creation of Best India.
Sometimes we heard the name of Amul.
Today, people from all over India and India are also known with every commodity of valuables.
But few people knew that the visionary Sardar Saheb had imagined the creation of a Union of Cooperative Milk Producers.
The district of Kheda, which was known as the district at that time, emphasized on this idea in 1942 and we have a living example of how Sardar Saheb did it for the sake of prosperity of the farmers today.
I pay my respects to Sardar Sahib.
On 31st October, we will remember Sardar Saheb, wherever we live on the Ekta Diwas.
My dear countrymen, after this Diwali, Kartik Purnima is also a part of the light festival.
Guru Nanak's teachings showcase the right direction for the entire humanity, not only for India but for the entire humanity.
Be it service, truth and everybody, this is the message of Guru Nanak.
Peace, unity and sovereignty were his key mantras.
The campaign to liberate the society from blind faith, blind faith and diligence was in every word of Guru Nanak.
I salute Guru Nanak from the heart of the heart on a happy occasion.
My dear countrymen, once again, this Deepawali dedicated to the soldiers of the country, you are not very proud of this Deepawali.
Your dream, your resolve will be successful in every way.
May your life be filled with happiness and peace, I congratulate all of you.
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you.
Just a few days ago, we lost eight brave children of the country in a transgressive attack in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute these brave soldiers and pay my respects.
And so I'll tell my countrymen what I said on that day, I'll repeat it, and the guilty will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
Today, I also want to talk to the people of Kashmir in a special way.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of anti-national forces.
And whoever understands the truth, they have separated themselves from that power and started walking on the path of peace.
Every maternal uncle is fast and complete, all schools and colleges.
Farmers also want their fruits and crops to reach all the markets of the country.
And in the last few days, business has started working in a smooth manner.
We all know that peace, unity and understanding are our solutions, our progress is also the path of progress and our development.
We have to cross the new summits of development for the next generation.
I am confident that we will find solutions and solutions together and create better ways for the future generations of Kashmir.
This administration is responsible for the protection of the citizens of Kashmir.
In order to maintain law and order, the administration has to make some arrangements.
I would like to tell the lawkeepers that we have the power, the law and the rules are required to maintain the law and order, to give peace to the people of Kashmir and to make complete use of it.
Sometimes people of different opinions are fond of what we think.
I have a chance to know a lot in Societies today.
From every corner of India, there is an opportunity to know the thoughts of all kinds of people and it increases the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, a student of the Eleventh Century, sent me a different kind of conscience.
He wrote: 'I am very surprised after the aggravated attack in Uri.
I am convinced that what I could do for patriotism.
I'm sure I'll read for three hours every day.
I would like to be a worthy citizen of the country.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere of aggression and in such a young age, you can imagine that this is my bliss.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to bring this feeling to the entire world.
And he inspired the common man by the Ministry of Jai Jawan, Jaikishan, and showed how to work for the country.
Red Bahadur Shastri ji showed that there is more accomplishment of patriotic exhibition in the voices of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to organize the movement, when the movement reached a rapid pace, whenever there was a need for a face-to-face structure, he used the movement with great success to organize more constructive work within the society.
All of us, the Armed Forces, the people of governance, will take their responsibility and the people of the country will contribute in some or the other constructive work towards this patriotic ambition.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
S.
Karthik wrote to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who went to Para Olympics had created history and their victory was the victory of Humansprite.
You two have not only created an emotional attachment of every person in the country towards the athletes participating in Para Olympics.
Perhaps, the performance of Para Olympics and our sportspersons, from the point of view of humanity, has completely changed our perspective towards the people.
And I won't forget our winner Deepa Master.
When he got the medal, he said, I lost my handicappedness through this medication.
There is a lot of strength in this matter.
This time, in Para-Olympics, nineteen athletes, including three women from our country.
If we compare the games of the Disabilities with others, the talent of physical capabilities, the sports tricks and the power of will and skills.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won the best four medals - two gold medals, one bronze medals and one bronze medal.
Golden Golden Jubilee Devendra Jhajaria brought the gold medal again after twelve years.
It's very old in twelve years... and once you get a gold medicinal plant, it's hungry.
But Devendra has shown that the age of the body, the age of age, has never been reduced and he has won the gold medal after twelve years.
He wasn't differing from birth.
Because of the electrical shock, he left his hand.
You can assume that the person who gets the first gold medal in the age of thirteen years and second gold medal in the age of thirteen years has done so much in his life.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won gold medals in Hygiene.
Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of five.
Poverty couldn't hinder his culture.
He didn't come from the big city, nor did he come from the middle-class clean family.
As far as one hundred years of age, fighting with Kathikanya, physical problems have brought the country a medal in the strength of culture.
Athlete Deepa has been associated with the owner's name.
Varun C.
Bronze medals won at Bhati Hyzamp.
The medals of Para-Olympics have been very important in our country, in our society and around us. These medals have done a great job in transforming our attitude towards our bankrupt brothers and sisters.
Very few people know how the Disabilities have shown paralysis in Para Olympics.
A few days ago, there was an Olympic competition at that place.
Not only this, I am amazed when I came to know that the fourth amongst the people who did not get any medal, they have run for less than the gold medals they have received from the common man.
In the coming days, India is moving towards creating a smooth plan for Para-Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, how amazing I have experienced in New Year in Gujarat last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India organised a Mega Campaign for the Disabilities.
There's a little girl with me, Gaurisardul, who's not seen in her eyes, has come from the remote jungle of Dang district.
The Government of India set up a world record on the soil of Navsari, which is very important.
In eight hours, six hundred Divyang, who could not hear, had the facility to install machines.
The incident took place at the Ginness Book of World records.
It is a matter of great pride for our countrymen to set up three-three World Records by the Disabled one day.
Dear countrymen, two years ago, we launched Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October in the birth anniversary of Popular Bapu.
On that day, I had said that cleanliness and cleanliness should be our self-sufficient and every citizen should be duties and create a circumstance of hatred towards cleanliness.
On 2nd October, when two years are over, I can assure you that the awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 125 crore people.
I had told you to move forward towards cleanliness. Today we can say that every step has been made to move forward.
That is, the country has moved 125 crore towards cleanliness.
Therefore, every citizen, the ruler, the government department or the roadside, the bus stand or railway station, the school-college, the Dharmasthan, the hospital-children, the poor-Krishi Ramani of the villages have contributed something or the other for cleanliness.
Friends from the media have also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we have to move far away.
If you are healthy, you will have to stop the practice of toilets in the open space to protect the citizens, especially the mothers and sisters.
And that is why a campaign for open defence free or freedom from the habit of toilets in the sportspersons has been started.
I went to Gujarat recently, where the officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the ODF this year on 2nd October.
Congratulations to those who have succeeded in this endeavour, who are trying to achieve success.
My condolences to the countrymen - for the honour of mothers and sisters, for the sake of health of small and medium children, we will have to free our country from this problem.
Come on, let's move forward with our determination.
I would like to start a new scheme for young friends who are now used for the use of technology, especially for them.
The Government of India has given a telephone number in 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this number 1969, you will not only be able to know the statistics of the construction of your city but also ask for a new toilet.
You, especially the young generation, get the benefits.
The Government of India invites corporate warlords to come forward and invites professionals to sponsor those who wish to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in the districts.
And therefore, with the Swachhta Mission, we have to move towards the Wasteto Composite.
The chemical circumstantials have been told that the compounds that have been created from Waste will be purchased.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming should give their necessary interests.
Those who have improved the health of their land, those who have lost their lives due to the use of chemical fertilizers, if they need such a quantity then they can supply them.
Shriman Amitabh Bachchan has contributed to this work as a brand ambassador.
I am imagining that new news is constantly coming about cleanliness.
One day I was informed that students from Gujarat Technology University have gone to 107-Two villages and have launched a campaign of awareness in the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also created a one-year calendar in its various departments.
Each department is focusing on 15 days, especially cleanliness.
I would like to appeal to the common people, if you are associated with these government departments, then you will also be involved in this campaign.
This time, about five hundred cities of a million people.
That is why there is a feeling among the people of every city that we are lagging behind, we will do something good next time.
Cleanliness has created an atmosphere of competition.
I hope that all citizens will participate in this campaign.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
Two years of Swachh Bharat Mission are being completed.
I urge Gandhi Jayanti to buy something or the other from Khadi to Deepawali.
Today, I would like to urge every family to buy something of the treasury, to burn the lamps of Deepawali in the poor houses.
Though on Sunday 2nd October, can we take part in the cleanliness drive somewhere as a citizen
You should work hard for at least two-four hours in the work of cleanliness and share one of his photos in the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, you can share it.
With this integrated effort, this campaign will be strengthened and new momentum will be achieved.
Come, let us remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and do something good for the country.
Dear Countrymen, there is a different pleasure in donating a respected aspect of life, there is a strange happiness.
In the past, I have also seen that when I had requested to leave Bhurtuki on gas, the manner in which the common man has served is an extremely inspiring event in our national life.
Some youngsters of our country, small organisations, people of corporate world, students of Vidyalaya and some voluntary organizations will celebrate the Joy of Giving Week in many cities from 2nd October to 8th October.
Their aim is to reach the disadvantaged people by gathering food items and clothes.
When I was in Gujarat, I saw that our officers went to different families and collected the old toys they had in their houses and they had all the ornaments in the poor settlements.
It's really nice to see the fun of those poor kids.
I believe that in those cities where the Joy of Giving Week will be celebrated, the enthusiastic youth will have to be encouraged and helped.
This festival is a festival of charity.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the youngsters who are doing this.
Dear countrymen, today, on 25th September, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyays birth anniversary and the birth anniversary of today.
How can the poorest person get the benefit of development
He spoke of his economic thinking, both his work and water in all the lands.
The country will celebrate her birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
The society, the government and all others have to be careful about how the people of development will benefit. Only then can we get rid of poverty.
Dear countrymen, I started the Mann Ki Baat on the day of Vijayadashmi two years ago.
I am conscious of the common people of the country, which has always been released in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the stakeholders for the way you have encouraged this programme and blessed them.
I express my gratitude to the Akashwani that they have not only launched the programme but also made every effort to reach the audience in all languages.
I am also grateful to all those people of the country who have written in the Mann Ki Baat programme, suggested and published the flaws in the government system.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat has become a new medium of social change not just a few minutes.
What could be the reason for anybody's greater satisfaction
Therefore, I am grateful to all those associated with it for making this festival a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijaya Dashmi, Deepawali is going on in the coming weeks.
Navratri or Durga Puja - This worship of power has to be the worship of the unity of the society.
There will be festivals to connect with each other.
Only then will it be the means of real energy and then will we celebrate the Vijay Parivar together.
Come on, worship the power, move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, on 29th August, the birthday of Hawki magicians.
On this day, the National Sports Day will be celebrated throughout the country.
I express my gratitude to Dhyan Chand ji and remind you all of his contribution.
He played an important role in winning Gold in Olympic Hockey in India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We all know the name of Breadman.
He said, "He scores goals like runs".
Dhyanchand ji was a sportsperson and a living fisherman of the country.
Once in a match in Kolkata, the sportsperson was hit by a hockey stick on the head of Dhanchand ji.
The match is over and only 10 minutes left.
Dhyanchand ji made three rounds in that 10 minutes and said, I took the revenge of the injury.
My dear countrymen, whenever Mann Ki Baat comes, there are many suggestions in MyGov portal or the Narendra Modi App.
Shriman Ajit Singh has written in the Narendra Modi App, Please tell us about their participation in Mann Ki Baat-Mays education and sports, because they have honoured the country by winning the medals in the Revolution.
Shriman Shachin has written to you that now I will urge the people of Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa to visit Mann Ki Baat.
One from North India and one from South India, one from East India, one from other from India.
It seems that women from all over the country have taken the burden of brightening the name of India.
Teacher has written in the MyGov Portal, we could have made better results in Olympics.
He said, Honourable Modi sir, first of all, thank you for winning two medals in Rio.
But in this context, I also want to attract your attention - what was the best sense of participation in our other competitions
The answer is: No.
And Ikaz can't do anything better than you.
Similarly, Shriman Satyaprakash Mehra has written in the Narendra Modi App, We need to emphasize on extra educational programmes in Mann Ki Baat, especially in the case of children and youngsters.
Thousands of people have expressed similar thinking.
It's not a way for the denunciants that we couldn't show results as expected.
In some cases, it has also been believed that our sportspersons did not reach the sportspersonship that they had shown in the field of sports.
And in the medal list we're just two medals.
But it is true that even if we do not get the risk, we will see that in many cases, the players of India have shown great vision for the first time.
See, in the shooting, our grandfather has secured the fourth position and the medals have been made for a very short span of time.
The Deepa Workers at Jimnastics have also performed a very good sports exhibition and have secured the fourth position.
But how will we forget that he has achieved the talent for the first Indian woman Jewellimpics and the final festival of Olympics at Gymnastics
Almost the same happened in Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna shoes.
This time we showed good results in the athletics.
32 years after Usha, Lilitabar achieved the talent of sports at the Track and Field Final.
Buxing-Obikash Krishna Yadav reached the uarter Final but could not get bronze medals.
There are many players like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal, therefore there are many who have shown great sports.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do more.
That's what we've done now, so if we do it, we'll be desperate again.
I've announced a committee.
We will deeply review the way the world is doing sports practices.
We'll make a roadmap of how we can do better.
We have planned the results by 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I would also request the state governments to create such committees and see that we can do the same in the field of sports.
I would like to urge the sportspersons to do Brainstorming in a neutral way.
The state governments will monitor themselves and send their advice.
We have to prepare the entire creator and I believe that we will achieve the best results of 125 crore countrymen, 65 percent of the youth and the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, Teachers Day.
I spent some time with students in Teachers for a few years and spent time like a student.
I've learned a lot from these little boys.
I have the same educational day as on 5th September.
But now I have to go to the G-20 Summit, so I want to express this feeling of my heart in Mann Ki Baat today.
As much as the mother's place in life, as the teacher's place.
This time, after Rio Olympics, the story of Pullela Gopicha is being discussed again and again.
He's a player right, but we found him the best trainee.
Today, I see Gopichand as more than one sportsperson.
And on Teacher's Day, I recognise Pullela Gopichand, her meditation, her self-sufficiency in the field of sports and her enjoyment in her own way.
We always feel the role of a teacher in all our lives.
5-October, the President of India, Dr.
On the birth anniversary of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Ji, the country celebrates this day as a Teacher's Day.
He tried to spend his days as a teacher everywhere in his life.
Not only that, he always used to say, "Good Teachers are those who have never lost their students.
Despite being the President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has shown this strange life that he has spent his days as a teacher.
Sometimes I'm afraid that I remember a lot of my teachers because he was our ideal in our small village.
Today, I can say with joy that one of my teachers who are now 91 years old, I still have a letter written by him every month.
If there is a photograph with your teachers, if there is a good incident with your teachers, you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
See, it is valuable for teachers to visit the country from the perspective of students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will be released a few days later.
Lord Ganesha removes all the obstacles and we all want our country, society, family, all the people and their lives to be uninterrupted.
Whenever we talk about the festival of Ganesh, it is very impossible to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak had given a public shape to the Ganesh Festival.
Through Jan Ganesh Festival, he made this religious festival a festival of national consciousness and celebrated social reforms.
Everything that affects social life through the Ganesh Festival should be discussed so that innovations organised during this period, the society becomes new and new.
But in the same way, the mantra of Lokmanya Tilak - Swaraj is our birth-sided right - the centre of all discussions.
Today, not only Maharashtra but the Ganesha Festival is celebrated all over the country.
Especially the youth started preparations with enthusiasm to celebrate the festival.
Some people are keen to follow the idea that Lokmanya Tilak had started this festival.
Discussions, creation competitions, shortcoming competitions are organized on various topics.
All those things that affect our society are beautifully depicted in the engravings of the statue.
In this public Ganesh Festival, a publicity campaign is being organized.
Lokmanya Tilak gave us this inspirational mantra, Swaraj Swaraj, our birth right.
But now we live in independent India.
We will now say that Su-Raj is our right to celebrate this festival of Ganesh.
We will move towards the Su-Raj, the Su-Raj will be our original demand.
Can't we move ahead with this mantra
Come on, I'm calling you.
Our lives are impossible without festivals, but according to the present demand, changes have to be made.
This time I have written a lot about Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja.
They are particularly worried about the environment.
A person named Shankar Narayan Pacific told me: "Modi Ji, do you tell everyone through the audience that they use the Ganesh idol built by the Plaster of Paris without using the Ganesh idol made by the village's architectural mud"
The protection of the environment, the protection of rivers and vegetation and the protection of the smallest living beings living in water from pollution is the transformation of the service of God.
Lord Ganesh - Vighanhari.
Therefore, we will not create such idols.
I don't know how you're gonna take these things to me, but I'm not alone, many more.
Eco-friendly Ganesh Festival - This is also a social service.
Durgapuja is still a while.
Now we have to ensure that those old families who built the idols, if they create the idols of the flower or the soil brought from the river then they will get the opportunity to grow.
And after the festival, they will be dedicated again and the environment will also be saved.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Madar Teresa will be conferred on the title "Sant" on the 4th of September.
Mother Teresa served her lifetime in the service of the poor people of India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of the title Madar Teresa.
A delegation of officials led by our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on the 4th of September to participate in the event.
We can learn something from saints, sages, sages and the great men.
I hope we'll do something new, learn and do something better.
Jan Shakti is believed to be a form of God.
In the past, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the common people with the five state governments in the Ganga Safai campaign for clean Ganga.
The villagers present in Allahabad have witnessed that they will stop the practice of open defecation in their respective villages and will not allow the Ganga to become a part of the cleanliness drive.
I am grateful to the Government of India and the Ministers who have made this event possible.
I am also thankful to the Chief Ministers of the five states who have taken an important step in connecting the people with the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
The seventeen-year-old boys and girls worked.
The letter has such an emotional effect that on the following day when the students came to school, they had given letters to some parents and school teachers, they would have toilets in their houses in a specified date.
A sixteen-year-old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka has sat on a Satyagraha against her family.
When the village chief Mahmoud Shafi can celebrate that Mallama is sacrificing for toilets, he has made a toilet within a week by spending Rs. 18,000.
The village head like Mallamma, the strength of the daughters and the strength of Mohammad Shafi.
The way to solve the problem is the people's power.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is now a dream of all Indians.
It's an option to anyone.
Some Indians have chosen it as their objectives.
The Government of India has taken into consideration and all the people are being told to create a film on Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send this shortfill to the Government of India.
Details of this will be available on the website.
This will be a competition and the one who will win on the day of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October will be awarded.
I'm telling TV channels that you're doing such a photo.
My dear countrymen, India is always trying to deepen our relationship with our neighbours, be easier and life-threatening.
A few days ago, an important event took place, our President Pranab Mukherjee honoured the Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Now many people will think that the President will show up a radio channel
But it's not a common radio channel, it's a very big step.
We're in Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are moving ahead with the same cultural tradition.
Therefore, on the one hand, AkashvaniMaitri and on the other, Bangladesh Betara will exchange various events and will be enjoyed by the people of Bengal on both sides.
Akashvani has contributed a major role in human contact.
The President inaugurated it.
I would like to thank Bangladesh as well as those who are associated with it.
I extend my best wishes to the friends of ASEAN and they are also playing their role in foreign policy.
Such incidents give new energy, new inspiration and this is the source of inspiration for the people of the country.
A few days ago, I got a letter that drove my heart.
About a maternal uncle, who retired teacher, wrote this letter.
If not, he'd ever deny his name in the letter, I'd like to tell you all.
He wrote in the letter, "When you requested to bury the gas, I left the gas barrier and then I forgot it.
My dear countrymen, you know, I tried, who sent a letter to those who left the gas bargain, and some of my delegates were present themselves.
I'm trying to write more than a million letters.
There is no need for this mother's anger, she and her like millions of mothers and sisters to bless the future of our country.
My dear countrymen, we were very worried about the purchase last year, but in the month of August this time we are alive with continuous floods.
There have been floods in some places of the country.
State Governments, Central Governments, local administrative institutions, social institutions and citizens have been able to do so.
But there's some news that we need to remember.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by pushing these small boys will have to responsibilities to these innocent boys.
My dear countrymen, this country is rich and rich in diverse diversity.
Thank you very much.
Today morning, I had the opportunity to spend some time with the young friends of Delhi.
I am confident that in the days to come, every young man has an atmosphere of excitement and excitement.
Within a few days, we all are going to organise the largest sports sports mahakumbh in the world.
Rio will be repeated in our ear.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organized a large and beautiful Round called Run for Rio, Khelo and Bachao, Khelo and Prashutat Hao.
Wherever I live in the coming days, I will do something to encourage our players.
I am also a citizen like 125 crore countrymen, and as a citizen, I will be with you to enhance the spirit of all these people.
Come, let us all achieve their efforts in the coming days as much as we can proudly honour each player.
Today, when I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poem was composed by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of the University of Primic-Punjab.
Maybe there are many other poets who wrote many poems, maybe somebody will invoke it in every language, but I want to enjoy the poem that Suraj ji has taught me.
A young man, Shriman Ankit, reminded me of the anniversary of President Abdul Kalam ji.
The country and the world have conveyed their best wishes on the Day of Prayer Day of Abdul Kalam Ji last week.
Whenever Abdul Kalam ji was named, science, technology, technologies and a powerful India of the future will be seen in front of us.
And that is why it is impossible that what is your government doing for the people of Abdul Kalam ji's dream
If we drag the old technology out of research and invention, then we will be out of the changing era of this world.
And that is why the new generation is attracted towards science and technology development and research and inventions, therefore the government has taken several initiatives.
Therefore, I say, Let us come innovation for Let us go ahead with our research.
And when I call 'Let us aim to innovate' then AIM means Atal I
If we have to initiate the next generation, then we have to connect with this work.
And therefore, the Government of India has taken initiatives to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we have strong and well-known researchers, there is a framework for inventions, innovations, to make them work, to reach a certain target.
Just as new research studies are required, it is also necessary to improve the old academics.
We need to find technical solutions to these problems in everyday life.
We have called upon today's youth to undertake Atal Grand Challenges. If there is any problem in your eyes, find technology to solve it, research, find and tell us.
If the Government of India is able to find such a new technology to solve our problems, then innovators are especially encouraged.
I am glad that people are very interested in this.
When we talked about the Tinkering Lab, we requested more than thirteen thousand schools and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand educational and other institutions were requested.
The Government of India and the Central Government are working closely to the helpers of the handicapped people.
Even if there are some problems in the rains, the hearts of everybody get overwhelmed in the rains because our entire financial pictures are in the centre of rain and farming.
Sometimes there is such a disease that we have to suffer from life.
But if we are aware, be careful, be aware of the diseases, then it's easy to save the breast.
Attempt to be cautious towards cleanliness, be cautious and try to be safe.
Take special care of the children and there is no mistake that dengue is just a bad settlement, but it's not right.
Glad, dengue spreads first in the rich Alaka.
You must have seen the television, yet sometimes we're sorry to use it.
Dear countrymen, I want to attract your vision.
Life is so fatal now, there's a race in it, so it's never possible to worry for itself.
I'm sick, I think I'm gonna get well soon, so I'm gonna get an antibiotic.
But my dear countrymen, the habit of eating antibiotics can lead to serious problems.
Maybe you've been comfortable for a while, but we should stop eating the doctor's advice.
The bacteria that cause tuberculosis and malaria are rapidly transforming into oneself so that the efficiency of medicine is reduced.
It is called antibiotic registration in medical terms.
Anti-biotics should be used for this purpose.
You must pay attention to it.
When it comes to health, I want to add another thing to it.
Sometimes we think of the lifestyle of the pregnant mothers in our country.
In our country, about three-thirds of women are pregnant every year, but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mothers die or children, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that in the last decade, the maternal mortality rate has decreased, but still it is not possible to save the lives of many pregnant mothers.
Deficiency of bleeding during pregnancy, infection during pregnancy, high blood pressure, unprecedented obstacles of diversity.
In keeping with this, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
According to the initiative, on 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be tested at the Government Health Centre for free.
Both mothers and children will be able to save their lives, and I would like to say specially to the physicians, don't you pay the poor mothers on the 9th day of the month
My doctor brothers and sisters, cannot they employ the poor for twelve days in a year
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is particularly concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
During the war in Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna spoke to the trees in the battlefield. We can imagine the importance of thinking about the trees in the battlefield.
In Geetha, Lord Shri Krishna says, "Ashwath: Sarva Vrikshanang" means that I am insoluble among all the trees.
It has been stated in the Cultural Policy that there is no tree that has no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates, crosses it like that tree species.
Therefore, the parents who are talking about their welfare should plant good trees and refresh like children.
Our scriptures - Geethaho, Cultural Policy or the Governance Parv of Mahabharata - are some of the present generations who have shown this vision of science in their own right.
A few days ago, I feel the example of a daughter of Pune, Golden, who touched my heart.
It has been stated in the Discipline of the Mahabharata that the trees also fulfil the duties of the children, and the golden work is done only to meet the needs of the society besides their parents.
Kisankhu Maruthi Mahatra of Narayanpur village of Pune-Junnar Taluk, Maharashtra, has married her grandson Sonal in a transparent manner.
Other temples can also start the tradition of sacrificing trees instead of prasad in this year.
Today, in order to build houses in India, crores of crores of rupees have to be imported from abroad.
If we plant plants on the sides of our food, which will be used to build houses and houses, then you can also sell them by using government permission after 15-20 years.
This can be a new source of income for you, and to save India from wood imports.
In the last few days, several states have taken several initiatives for this rainy season and the Government of India has passed a CAMPA Act recently and more than forty thousand crore rupees are being made available to the states for plantation of trees.
Rajasthan has celebrated such a desert state and has taken an opportunity to plant around 15 lakh plants.
There is no small thing to plant around 50 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know the soil of Rajasthan can understand how difficult it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also targeted to increase the greenery of the state by 50 percent by 2029.
The Green India Mission, which is being run by the Central Government, is greenishing the Railways through the project.
Gujarat also has a bright synergy of the Forest Festival.
This year, Gujarat has celebrated several projects called Amban, Ektavan and Shahid Van as forest-hosts and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I can't mention all the kingdoms, but it's really worthy of praise.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa a few days ago.
This is my first journey, and whenever foreign travels, we talk about corruption, industrialisation, discussions on security, sometimes the 'Mou' becomes witnessed - all this happens.
But I had a kind of pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever South Africa is considered, it is very impossible to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
As soon as the words of arrogance, love, forgiveness are heard in this world, their faces are brightened in our eyes.
I visited the Phoenix Satellite during my visit to South Africa, which is known as Sarvoday.
I am fortunate to visit the train from Peter Mariusburg station where Mahatma Gandhi had visited the train to transform Jonaike Mohandas into Mahatma Gandhi. But now I want to talk to the great people who have served their lives for equal rights and equality.
Even after so much penance, they didn't seem to have anything to do with their faces.
Geetha's deeds that have been spoken, as if I could see them.
That meeting will be remembered for me.
There cannot be a bigger mantra for any society or any government than equal opportunity.
Everyone thinks equally and everybody thinks that this is the path leading us towards a bright future.
We want a beautiful life, we want a good future for children. Everyone needs different.
Priority can be different, but the path is the same, and that path is synergy, equal opportunity, equal thinking and thinking of everyone.
Come, let us feel proud of those Indians who have lived their lives in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to artist Burma, he has conveyed to me an incident.
Prime Minister, I am calling for artist Burma from Bangalore.
Just a few days ago, I had read in a newspaper register that a gentleman had committed suicide by losing Rs.
I have a lot of condolences for your family as a woman.
I want to know what you are thinking about this intense and loud e-mail.
"Some people have lost their lives.
There is a new way of surveillance through technology which is spreading across the world.
On the one hand, as technology has played a big role in economic development, on the other hand, people who are using it have also come down in the field.
Sometimes you've made a mistake, because they're so beautiful as if they're real.
Your credit card, debit card, and your bank account is empty through technology, by making a fake letter pad.
This is a new kind of cheating, digital cheating.
We have to stay away from this kind of sensitivity, be awake, and in such a lie, we have to share it with the friends and friends of the men.
Our Parliamentarians also bring people from their respective areas, meet me, talk and talk about their problems.
But recently I had a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh were with me.
You've picked a nice picture at the station.
Not only this, in search of the plastic bottles or oil cannons that were rooted in the village, they have built the Vartical Garden by planting soil and planting trees.
In this way, they have given the entirely new format to the railway station.
You'll see the station when you go to Aligarh.
There is a sense of innovation.
This is an example of the changes in the participation of the people.
Thanks to those who are doing this kind of work in the country, especially to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, whenever the monsoon comes, the season of festivals begins in our country.
Festivals will be held at various places in the coming days.
Festivals will be celebrated in the temple, at the dharamshala and you will also be celebrating at home and outside.
Rakhibandhan is an important festival for us.
Like last year, cannot you give the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or 'Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana' to the mothers and sisters of the country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
My dear countrymen, there are many people who have been born after Independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in a free India.
On 8th August, Bharatchando movement started, it will be 75 years and will be celebrating 70 years of Independence on 15th August.
We are enjoying freedom and feeling proud to be an independent citizen. This is the time to remember those who brought this freedom.
75 years of the uit India Movement and 70 years of Independence can inspire us in new motivations, and it can be a time for the country to take a good decision.
I hope you will do something good in the inspiration of self-reliance.
Nowadays technology has become so simple that whatever you can easily reach me, let me invite you to recall the life of freedom fighters.
Everyone plans at the time of the holiday.
And this holiday is my season, so I enjoy my taste.
Sometimes it feels it's nice if you have some time to sleep in the afternoon.
But this time the hot heat has funny all around.
It's very natural to worry about the countrymen.
And the water storage available in these reservoirs is also decreasing.
Therefore, people are very sensitive towards water and efforts are made to do something or the other for water conservation.
Just a few days ago, somebody told me that Hebrew Bazar Gram Panchayat of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers under it have given great importance to the need for water in the villages.
Those crops which need more water have decided to quit all those crops.
It's not as simple as it looks.
Everyone has made a big decision together
If a factory uses water and we talk of shutting down the factory, because the use of water is more, you know what will be the result.
It's true that I spoke of a small village in Hebrew market, but there are more villages like this.
I congratulate all these villagers for this kind of good work.
I am told that the Gorwa Gram Panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried to build agricultural reservoirs in their efforts.
They built about 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This led to increased groundwater levels and water grew very high.
I'll say they're more complimentable than the railways.
People's nature is, no matter how dangerous the day is, if there is a good news, the danger is cut off.
Since 110 percent of the rainfall in place of 106 percent was universal, it seemed as if a message of great peace was received.
There is still a delay in rains, but the news of good rains has created a new inspiration.
The farmers need soil, the fields are used for crops.
Now we can't take the soil from the village pond and take it to the field
It will also improve the area and increase its water conservation capacity.
Sometimes the cement hall, sometimes the water can be circulated by filling stones and soils in the empty hall of the sar.
Water level will grow, water will come in our well.
So, as much water as possible.
The water of the village and the water of the village will remain in the villages and if we do something for this purpose then it will be possible to do it in a collective effort.
So today, the water crisis is very good, it's going on, but we have time for the next month.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked MyGov - will the Ganga Safai Abhiyan be possible in our lives
How many governments have come and how many projects have been constructed, too many costs have been made.
And that is why it is very natural to raise this question in the minds of millions of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna.
Ganga introduces our routine and gives us the power to save us.
As the Ganges flows, the economy of the country also provides a new transformation.
One Bhagirath brought us to the Ganges, but to save it, crores of Bhagiraths are needed.
This will never be possible without the help of the people.
We have to be Change Agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
There are several schemes going on by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full cooperation on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organizations alone.
Several steps have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and factory.
Every day, there is a large number of drains and drains in the Ganges.
In order to clean this jungle, Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. keep on cleaning the jungles while swimming in water.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and regularize the cleaning of the jungle.
Earlier, I was told that where efforts are made, it is possible to clean up the jungle from 3 to 11 tons per day.
So it's right that we are able to clean a large quantity of jungles.
There is a plan to set up a trash skiimmer in some more places in the coming days.
And this will help the people along the banks of Ganga and Yamuna to understand very soon, an effective plan has been prepared for pollution control of pulp and papper, distillery and Sugar industry.
Pulp and Papper Industries Bablack Leaquier's factory is almost completely closed.
These events prove that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has also increased.
People are also providing financial assistance for the cleanliness of the Ganges, which is going on in a very good way.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayeti Raj Diwas in India.
Today, Panchayati Raj system has been started in our country.
And today the Panchayati Raj system is working successfully as an important solitary of our democracy.
On 14th April, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and today we celebrate the Punchayeti Raj Diwas on 24th April.
This is a beautiful event, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He was inspired to do this important work to connect the village with the Constitution.
In this regard, his birthday from 14th April to 24th April, this 10-day Bapi Gramody has been launched from India.
I am fortunate that on 14th April, Baba Saheb Ambedkar had the opportunity to visit his place of birth in Mahu.
Today, on 24th, in Jharkhand, where most of the tribal brothers and sisters are present, I will celebrate Panchayeti Raj Diwas.
Once again, I will talk to all the Panchayats of the country at three o'clock.
The expedition has worked as a very sensitivity.
At the same time, all these programmes have been going on for ten days in all the villages of India.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads for this.
You have made this opportunity to further strengthen the democracy for the progress and prosperity of the villages in a very basic and new way.
And that is why we all will get the same Epsy Fruits as we will emphasize on the rural abdomen.
Shermila called from Mumbai to Dharkur and spoke of her thinking.
- PM ji Namaskar
I'm telling you from Mumbai to Shermila Dharkur.
You have questions about my school and college education.
Like in education, there has been a need for revision for the past several years.
Today, if there is a dream of parents in every family then it is the education of children.
It's gonna come after the house.
This idea for the education of children in a country like India, the idea of their greater education and a greater strength.
This idea of giving better education to the children is more important and more awareness is needed.
Therefore, I would like to urge all the parents and parents to discuss the school programme with children for a long time.
And if you feel anything then go to school and talk to the teachers.
This surveillance will help in reducing many thrusts in our education sector.
And it will be possible in everyone's partnership.
Every government in our country has given importance to education and they have tried their own way.
And it is also true that for a long time, we had an interest in building educational institutions, expanding education systems, building schools and colleges, appointment of teachers and teachers, many children coming to school etc.
We have done a great job in the field of education.
Now we have to emphasize on quality education.
Good education through literacy campaign - this should be our main objective.
There was a need to calculate the infrastructure.
Now it is necessary to assess the achievements of education.
So far, how many students have come to school.
Free, filled, filled - this mantra was chanted forever.
But now those children who have come to school, we have to undergo good and worthy education.
You've seen the current government budget.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
It's okay, there's a lot of way left.
But if we decide 125 crore countrymen, then we can also cross this path.
Shermila ji, however, is sure to bring about a positive change in our own thinking.
You must have noticed that this time some work has been done outside the traditional idea of the budget.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten private universities have been asked to be free from government bonds and they have been asked to know what challenges they face for becoming the best universities.
The universities of India can compete with other universities of the world, and it is necessary to make such a competition.
With this, education is equally important as skills.
Therefore, technology will play a very important role in education.
Tele-Technology will make our education easier.
And I believe I can understand the consequences in a far-reaching future.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, Namaskar
I'm calling Meena Karnwal from Bijnor.
Today, the youth play an important role in playing games as well as writing.
They need to have the mentality and good leadership to work in a bound manner so that their universal development can be possible.
I want you to inspire a large number of young people. I want the government to encourage more and more NCCs, NSS and India Scouts and Guides.
You have sent me so much proposition that I also advise the NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides, before talking to you.
On repeated requests and propositions, I organized a meeting with the heads of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross, Nehru Youth Centre.
When I asked them when they met together before, they told me that when the country was free, they had attended such a meeting for the first time.
Now I've got something like this before them.
I told them, why wouldn't our young friends take part in water conservation during this summer
Something like this happened to them.
I see it as a lighting thing amongst us.
You must have noticed that political situation in our country has reached such a stage that in the last few elections, there has been a lot of discussions - how many parties will give gas cylinders
On the other hand, the economists spoke of reducing gas subsidy.
Some committees have also proposed to reduce gas subsidies.
It's all the experience.
I spoke like this, but today I want to say, I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore families have voluntarily left the gas subsidies.
And this one crore family is not rich.
I see that some of those who have left the subsidies are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers, such families of middle class or lower middle class.
But it has been observed that more than 80 percent of these crore families who have left the gas subsidies have left the gas subsidies by standing in line with the distributor.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government leaves a little on the tax, then the government's appreciation is heard on weekly TV and newspapers.
In our country, subscribers are considered equal rights.
But one crore families left the CBC.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to those crore families, because they have forced political leaders to think newly.
The world's economists, those who do this, presented such a financial equation, are also out of concern.
Sometimes I think we declare that there will be no ticket examiner on this railway track today.
We can do a lot of such tests.
Relief on the people of the country can be achieved.
Anyway, it's your opinion.
This cannot be a government rule, but we can create such an environment.
And this environment is not creating any political leader, but only one family of the country has created this environment.
Every braking news is bad news.
Is there nothing good about us in this country of 125 crore
Please change this situation.
He used to say this again and again.
A few days ago, on behalf of a news paper, I wrote a letter to me that on Monday, they don't print any destitute news.
And everybody wants the common man to get the right and good news.
It is true that if a well-known person speaks good words, chooses good words, shows it better, the impact can be seen more than that of a good news.
Good news inspires good work.
It's okay, it's very important that the bad place will be reduced by yourself.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will be removed, it will be
Perhaps you know that this is why a website has been opened by the government - Transforming India - this website is being published.
This is not just the government but also the common man, you can send a good news to this portal.
You can also join it.
Ravi ji, you gave me good advice, but please don't be angry with me.
We all try to work together in a constructive manner, try to talk about a constructive goal.
The speciality of our country is Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can be the centre of attraction for tourists.
Only a few people in the world know that for such a long time, millions of people come to the bank of the river.
In a calm mind, this fair ends in a calm atmosphere.
The event initiates a huge stake in the spirit of inventory management, in terms of common man's partnership.
For the past few days, I've seen that some people are uploading pictures of the silly Kumbh.
I want the Government of India and the State Tourism Department to organize a competition for these pictures.
Tell the people to upload the best photos.
He said that we have emphasized on cleanliness and that cleanliness should not only be stuck in this campus but also people from Kumbh will take a message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh is a religious and spiritual fair but we can also make it a social mixture.
We can also build a cultural field.
This can be an opportunity to reach the village.
My dear countrymen, on this auspicious day of Panchayat Raj, I will meet you again and again thank you all.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
For Mann Ki Baat, there is always a waiting from me and from you.
This time too, I have seen a large number of letters, comments and phone calls that have received many stories, suggestions and inspirations.
I think you're testing me.
In spite of this, I want to share your words with you once again in the chain of Mann Ki Baat.
You must remember that last time I had talked about a book from Premchand ji and we decided that if someone reads a book, we will share something with everyone through the NarendraModiApp.
I have seen that a large number of people have shared information about different types of books.
I am glad that people have discussed a number of topics like science, technology, new innovations, history, culture, trade and self-employment.
Some people advised me to talk about some other books.
But I have to admit that I don't have enough time to read books.
But I think we should take this experience forward in the last one month.
I want this book to be an active platform for the corner, readers and writers.
Friends, I feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I had touched this thing before, but today I am feeling that this water conservation was just like touching your heart, it was a favourite thing for the common man.
I am feeling that recently this water has dragged the hearts of your countrymen.
There is a lot of effective efforts across the country for water conservation.
People are distributing information about various traditional practices.
There has been a lot of innovative publicity on medical delivery.
This is not only preventing the destruction of land and crops but also provides water to the fields.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful state of the north-east, the first state of the country, the state of Meghalaya, which has embarked on a policy or water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There are many fairs at this time.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of society come to the festival.
We can organize the exhibition here and dramatically deliver water conservation along with the festival.
That is why I want to listen to you some children today.
These are Nidhi Baipatu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdhakar, Anant Tewari, Prati Nag, Athar Deshmukh, Aryanesh Ganguly and Hariq Ala-Manda.
You will also be proud of what I say about them, and you will also have a glow amongst you.
We all know that the cancer is a word that the whole world fears.
It looks like death is in the root.
But these ten children have not only defeated fatal diseases like cancer in life, but their achievements have brightened the name of India in the whole world.
In the field of sports, we are often seen that a player is a champion after winning the tournament or after winning the medals, but this is a rare experience where he has become a champion before joining the competition and is also a champion in life.
This month, World Childrens Winners Games was organised in Moscow.
Sports like shooting, swimming, running, football and table tennis are organized.
This 10 Kyi champions of our country won the medals in this tournament.
Some of them have won medals in many games.
My dear countrymen, you are surely proud of the achievements of India in far-flung space through my belief and skies.
Sanjay Haripura from Yodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Many like Arvind Rao have written about this in the Narendra Modi App and MyGov from all parts of the country and expressed their interest in discussing Chandrayaan-2.
In fact, from the perspective of Space Research, 2019 is a very good year for India.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March and then this moon-2.
If you look at the elections then it is not possible to discuss such a big and important news like A-Sat.
Within just three minutes, A-Sat missile was able to hit satellites 300 kilometers away.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve success in this particular sector.
Recently, on 22nd July, the whole country was proud of how Chandrayaan-2 from Sriharikota has moved towards an interim edge.
These pictures of the successful launch of Chandrayaan-2 have filled the country with pride, strength and happiness.
Chandrayaan-2 means a special kind of mission.
We should believe in our talent and power.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is an entire Indian initiative.
It's Indian in my heart.
This is a completely indigenous mission.
The way our scientists used to lunch Chandrayaan-2 in record time and day and night to solve all technological problems.
We also face such a temporary obstacle in our lives.
But always remember that we have the ability to overcome this obstacle.
I firmly believe that this Chandrayaan-2 movement will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
It's the final truth that science is the path of development.
We are now looking forward to the month of September when two lander Vikram and Rover will be transformed into the moonground.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell my country's students friends and my young friends about a charming competition and invite the youth of the country to invite them to a quiz competition.
Asked how to lunch the rocket, how to send a satellite or what we can know from this satellite or satellite.
I would like to urge my young friends to take part in this cooking competition and recall it.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those champions, but for this, you have to take part in this uiz competition and get the highest number.
My dear countrymen, you will keep looking at one thing, our Mann Ki Baat has accelerated the Swachhta Abhiyan at different times.
The efforts that are being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started 5 years ago today has created new standards of cleanliness in collaboration with everyone.
It is true that we have not yet achieved the ideals in the field of sanitation, but the way Swachhta Abhiyan has achieved sanitation in public places, it is the result of the will of 130 crore countrymen.
But we won't stop it.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a message from Shri Yogesh Saini and his team on the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who has left the US job to serve Bharat Mata and returned to the country.
He took the responsibility of making Delhi clean, not just a few days ago.
He started his work with his team from Lodhi Garden's apartment.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi are decorated with beautiful pictures.
When he made slums from overbridges and school walls to beauty, many more started coming forward and this way the work started going on.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with Street Painting during the Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team played a very important role in this work.
There is no word in colour and line, but the impact of the paintings made by them is more than a thousand words.
In the Swachhta Abhiyan, we continue to observe this beauty.
It is very important for us to create wealth from waste to wealth.
That is, we have to move towards making gold from the dirt.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a charming comment on the MyGov portal.
The comment was from Sopian District resident brother Mohammed Aslam of Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote, "Mann Ki Baat" is very nice to hear the event.
I am happy to note that I play an active role in organizing the Community Mobility programme Back to Village in my state, Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in June.
I think this program should be held every three months.
With this, the online monitoring of the event should be organized.
I think this is the first such event where the people could speak directly to the government.
Brothers and sisters, After reading the message that I had sent to you, I would like to know about the Back to Village project, so I read in detail about this and then I felt that it should be given to the whole country.
The scheme is indicative of how much interest the people of Kashmir are in connecting with the root causes of progress in the country.
They also learned whether the villagers are getting government services.
How can they raise their income
Some more things were added to the programme to make it more attractive.
Childrens Sports Competition was organised under Khelo India Scheme.
The event was attended by sports sports equipment, manrega project work cards and textiles and tribals.
Economic literacy camps were opened and stalls were given by the Department of Agriculture, Horticulture etc.
Thus, this event became a development festival.
It was a festival of public participation and a celebration of public awareness.
The common people of Kashmir were silent on this development festival.
An officer was so impressed with the warm greetings made by the villagers that they stayed in the village for two days.
It is a matter of great pleasure for the people to participate in these areas and to create a programme for their progress.
This is a wonderful outcome of a new emergence and a new resolve.
This kind of programme and the participation of the people in it proves that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in governance.
Those who want to spread their hatred on the path of development and stop the progress will never succeed in their hatred.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Vendra, who was honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, went to describe the form of Shravanamas in one of his poems.
As soon as we look around in this season, it appears that the blind people have covered the green sheet.
This time, the festival of love for brothers and sisters is also celebrated.
You will be happy to know that the most pilgrims have participated in the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the Amarnath cave since July 1.
More than the pilgrims who participated in this 60-day journey in 2015, more than 28 days have joined.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I would like to especially appreciate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their guests.
Those who have come back to the journey brought the people of that state with warm reminders and guests.
These things will help in improving tourism in the future.
I am told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham in the last one and a half months since the four Dhams started this year in Uttarakhand.
After a huge natural calamity in 2013, a number of pilgrims reached there for the first time.
I appeal to all of you, you must go to those areas where the beauty of the country looks magnificent during the rainy season.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage cannot be a greater teacher than that.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and live months of resurrection will create new energy, new hopes and new upliftment amongst you all.
On the other hand, this is the time when there is heavy rains in different parts of the country.
When we see TV, on one side rains, water thai, traffic jam.
You will have to come out with the family to see the other pictures of rain where our farmers, birds and waterfalls flow.
My belief is that this rain brings you all together with freshness and happiness.
My dear countrymen, where the Mann Ki Baat starts, where it feels difficult to stop, but, in particular, a boundary of time.
I'll be back after a month.
I'm grateful to all of you for the Ester.
My young friends, you all are busy in the test.
Some people may have been tested.
And there's a turmoil in some people - because on the one hand, the T-20 cricket world cup.
Even today, you are waiting for a match between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia. I congratulate the two-party players.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been continuously getting the lowest place - we are losing and following.
Now, in FIFA, our place has come down so much that we can't dare to talk.
Throughout this year, we can create a soccer-foot atmosphere.
In schools, colleges, every corner of the country, our young generations, our school children sweat.
There are very few people who go abroad, most people go somewhere in their kingdom for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people go out of the kingdom.
Earlier, I told you to upload the photos from wherever you don't go.
We have to take this task forward.
You can do the same thing, but now write something with him - not just the phone.
And he says, "A traveler with obeservation is a bird out wing".
If you want to see good things, you have to make your eyes.
And I'm fortunate, I've got a lot of chance to travel.
When I wasn't the Chief Minister, I wasn't the Prime Minister, and I was a little like you, I've been roaming around.
Maybe there is no district in India where I had no chance to go.
Tourism plays an important role in creating life.
And now the youngsters of India are going on tourism with courage and are going to solve the curiosity.
I thought it was a good example.
Our young generations should be brave and they should try to reach where no one has left their feet.
I would like to especially thank Coal India.
So stay away.
When we saw the pictures of the people there, we feel what to get there.
And that's why people go away from the mine.
But that sort of mine has been built as a tourist destination
And I am happy that more than ten thousand people have seen the environmental fabric mines tourism centres in Saun village near Nagpur so far.
This place gives itself a chance to see new things.
I hope you can do some work on cleanliness if you go out on holidays.
Maybe it's not too scientific, but it's happening.
Cannot you also give importance to the cleanliness of the tourist destination as a tourist
My sure belief, our young friends will help in this regard.
So there is a lot of employment from tourism.
India is still far behind in tourism as compared to other countries of the world.
But if we believe that our tourism has to be strengthened then we can surely attract the whole world.
We can thus draw a large part of the world tourism.
And then it will be possible to provide ways to millions of new young people in our country.
Be it the government, the institution, the society or the citizen - all of you have to do this together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, the vacations come and go, it's not good for me.
You can also think about this.
Would you like to let your holidays, important years of life, these important times go away like this
I'm telling you what you can think.
Cannot you take this vacation to add more quality to your personality
If you don't know how to swim.
If you don't know how to drive a cycle, please drive a cycle on holidays.
Do something to enhance your personality, your capacity and efficiency during the holidays.
Not only the areas I have spoken, but there is a greater chance than that.
This will enhance your personality and your self-confidence.
We'll talk about it among friends.
Some suggestions have been received from the MyGov portal for this time.
"My name is Ab Chaturvedi.
I am glad to have done this, and I have also been friendly with many birds on this occasion.
I request you to repeat this in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I want to thank this boy by the name of Ab Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
My father told me he was doing this all year and many birds became his friends.
Mahadevi Burma, the great poet of Hindi, loved birds.
In his poem, he wrote: "Do not let you go away, fill up your feet, fill your pots with sweet cold water.
Come, let us make this talk of Mahadevi ji useful.
I congratulate the people and thank you for that. You have reminded me of very important.
Industrial coke has taken a very sensitive matter for all of us from Maheshur.
He said, the milkman, the newspaper, the Postman came near our house.
Sometimes the dresser, the dresser, goes through the way.
Have we ever called for their drinking water during summer, have we ever given them water
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot of digital India.
Some people think digital India is the world of young people in the city
If you have downloaded this app on your mobile phone, then many information related to agriculture and climate will come in your hands.
What is the situation in the market, what is the situation in the picare market, what is the use of good crops, what is the appropriate medicines, etc.
And if you put a question in front of them, they will answer it and make you understand it.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This time it is very important for the farmers to start the farming.
Can't we find those old places once again, clean them so that more water can be stored
This time you have seen that efforts have been made to build 5 lakh ponds and ponds of farming land.
Under the Manrega scheme, water conservation has been emphasized to create resources.
You can plan how to save water in villages and villages, how to save every drops of the coming rain and how to start these awareness campaigns.
You should be involved in this regard in various government schemes so that there is a public discussion about the importance and conservation of water.
There are many villages in the country, there are many progressive farmers, many conscious citizens who are doing this.
But we have to move ahead.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to tell you another thing. Just a few days back, the Government of India organized a big agricultural fair.
I have seen how modern technology has come and how many changes have been brought about in agriculture.
But these techniques have to reach the farming sector.
And now the farmers are saying that the use of chemical fertilizers has to be reduced.
I congratulate you like this.
The most use of chemical fertilizers has made our soil sick.
But if good spices are given in large quantities, would you like to eat it
Whatever good sir, the use of these serpents will be a cause of harm.
Everything needs to be used.
It also reduces costs, savings.
I am hopeful that the necessary tasks for water conservation can be completed with full attention.
The water will save the farmers, the more they will benefit and the better life will save them.
My dear countrymen, 7th April is World Health Day.
This year, the World Health Day theme is Beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is a disease that calls all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, then many sick guests enter their homes, body.
According to statistics, in 2014, there were 6. 6 crore diabetes patients in our country.
Three percent death is caused by diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types - Type 1 and Type 2.
Type-1 is hereditary, mother-father, there is a possibility of children.
And the reason for Type-II is deafness, old and excessive weight.
The world is concerned about diabetes, so on 7th, the theme of World Health Day is diabetes.
We all know, the biggest reason for diabetes is our lifestyle.
There's a little hard work.
There's no name or smell.
I'm not walking.
We're playing online.
Nothing happens in the offline.
If you are interested in Yoga, then practice yoga.
Otherwise, at least run away.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then our India will be healthy.
And now all the chances are close to the hand, it becomes very easily.
You must think about it.
On 24th March, the Yakshma Divas was celebrated in the world.
When I was young, I'd be afraid to hear the name of the trick.
But when yawning was the cause of death, we were afraid.
But now we don't care.
The number of tuberculosis patients in our country is much higher than the entire world.
If we have to get rid of tuberculosis then we need proper treatment and cervical treatment.
If you leave in the middle of the treatment, there is a new problem.
Tension is a disease that everyone around knows, they can also give advice to check up.
That means it's a disease that needs to be tested quickly.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of work going on in this regard.
More than 13,500 Microscopic Centres have more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Treat properly and continue treatment until the disease is cured.
I would like to request you, yes, or diabetes - we have to defeat them.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But it's not just the government, the doctor, the medicine - until you come forward.
And that is why I appeal to the people of the country today, come and overcome diabetes and get rid of tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, many important days are coming in April, especially on 14th April, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's birthday.
His 125th birth anniversary was swollen in the entire country.
An 'Mahu' of Panch Tirth is his birthplace.
His study in London, Deepa in Nagpur.
I am fortunate that this year on 14th April, the birthplace of revered Babasaheb Ambedkar will be fortunate to visit Mahu.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to become a responsible citizen of the country.
Following that path, we can pay the highest tribute to him as a responsible citizen of the country.
The festival is celebrated in different states and in different names.
Someone calls it 'Nav Sambalsar', some are 'Gudi-Parva', some are 'Year Pratipada' and some are 'Ugadi'.
You know, I had told you last time that my Mann Ki Baat program will be heard in about 20 languages as long as you can hear your mobile phones.
You have to call just a missed call.
This facility is just a month, and I am happy that around 35 lakh people have benefitted from it.
You must also write the number - 81908 81908.
I repeat, 8190881908.
I'm glad I can join you.
I want you to be in this regard too.
I am as worried about your children's tests.
But if we change our thinking about the test, we might be able to stay stressless.
I have said in my previous Mann Ki Baat that you must send me your advice through the Narendra Modi App.
In my Mann Ki Baat event, I would like to talk to my parents, testimonists and teachers in a special way.
I want to talk about what I heard, what I read, what I've been told.
I know the test starts in a few days.
How many percent of the tests
I mean, you're gonna set some targets for yourself.
Don't put pressure on anyone else's expectation.
You must work but a realistic and possible goal should be achieved for yourself and try to achieve this goal.
When I played cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
As the time has come, people's expectations have increased.
It was very important for me to remove a solution.
I thought I'd expect myself and set myself for myself.
And if I set my target and fulfill that goal then I can definitely do something better for the country.
And I've always tried to achieve this goal.
My goal was always on the strength and that is why the goal has been fulfilled gradually.
And I believe God will give you good results.
Good luck
Don't fall under the pressure of hope.
You have to create your future.
Your goal is to stabilize yourself.
Why would I finish my time to competition with others
Why don't I try to break all records made by myself
Friends, don't think of the test number.
Life should always be driven to a great goal - a dream should be taken and promised.
Whether we're driven on the right path, or not, this test is about his experience.
If there is some deficiency in fulfilling the expectations, then don't be disappointed.
Build more and more mindset to work and try.
Thousands of people have written several small phones on my app.
Shreya Gupta says the healthy body is the healthy mind.
Friends, You must pay attention to your studies as well as your health, so that you can give the tests properly.
However, 365 days of our daily life should be in line with our dreams and resolves.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy, who specially asked him to sleep at the right time and take a revision after dawn.
We should reach the test centre with admit cards and other papers, the Prime Minister said.
I couldn't say this because I'm sorry about sleeping.
And when I told you to sleep, don't think I'm sleeping for the test.
Don't understand, I'm asking you to sleep to be depressed to give good tests.
Don't do that.
I believe you won't do that.
There is a need to strengthen the foundation stone of chains and success in life.
Strengthening of life is the strongest foundation.
The untouchables and discords that work in the morning at noon, it seems that the work has been done.
That's why I don't think anything is small.
Do it properly, look at it.
Friends, I've seen the test takers in two ways.
One, those who have read, what they have learned, what has been made good.
Secondly, there are other test takers who don't know any questions, what kind of questions will come, what can we solve
The question papers will not be difficult. I have seen these two types of tests.
A lot of tests with grandfather's game.
When you're playing, you don't know what rice you're gonna get, you don't know what questions you're gonna ask.
If you're calm, eat and sleep properly, you'll see that your brains can recall the correct answer of the right question.
Don't take a very high hope - Just look at it as a challenge. Can I remember what I have learned from all over the year, can I answer these questions
So stay calm, sleep well at night, don't be more self-sufficient, but don't be a neutralist.
I've seen that you're afraid of the test, you're better than that.
So, be self-confident and be grateful for you.
"Vishwanathan Anand is a very important thing.
His eyes don't move around.
We heard that Arjun's life was just looking at the eyes of the bird.
Similarly, while playing, he has a complete concentration on the goal and that is the peace of his heart.
You will not talk to friends - you will be alone, you will be conscious and you will not be able to calm your heart until the last moment.
Therefore, laugh and laugh with friends, you will be quiet.
But if the water isn't calm, nothing can be seen.
Then I think - No, if I take a little rest, it will be nice. That's why I made myself a way.
Deep breathing - let's breathe deep.
Let's breathe three to five times.
Sometimes it's 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but I'm quiet enough to understand something.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you.
Because most of the time we've seen, we've been testing, what's right - and what's wrong
If parents are educated at home, they are teachers, then tell them to write what I wrote in the entire account.
We're stuck in it.
Friends, you don't do that.
That's what happened at the time of the test.
Talk to the people of the family about other things, remind them of any laughing in the coming days.
If you're going to go somewhere with your parents, remember that scene.
Leave the test for at least half an hour.
In the present perspective, he is trying to reach the world on the importance of Ramcharit Manas.
Popular Murari Bapu gave some important suggestions to the students.
And whatever the situation, please accept it.
In my experience, we can be mentally happy and happy if we follow the situation.
If you don't put any stress in your heart, then you will be successful.
And if you succeed, you will not be sorry for failing.
We are grateful for the advice given by the revered Muraribappu for all of us.
Friends, today I want to talk more.
My mobile app is Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
But, my friends, if I say - if you start yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be done injustice to you.
But those who do yoga will not do that today, they have tests.
If you continue to do yoga, then you must do it.
If you don't do yoga before the examination, you know that there is a person who can do some yoga exercise within two to five minutes.
Why don't you do it
Build your entire day tablet in such a way that it can reach the traffic jam on time even if it gets stuck.
Otherwise, this kind of situation creates anxiety.
And one thing, the guidance on the question paper seems to have lost time to read them.
I have seen that sometimes it cannot be understood properly after getting the question papers, but if the directors are properly read, we can take care of it and fix it.
It's very important to understand questions.
Rao stressed on patience - in a very small way, he gave his advice to all the test takers.
That's what I call my young friends.
Keep in mind that there are many opportunities in our country.
What you need is jeeep, self-reliant and capable.
If all these qualities were, you would be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb that he has encouraged the children of the country, the words of determination, determination, integrity, integrity and hard work.
Hold on, guys. Hold on.
If you're looking, you'll be afraid too.
The bright future is waiting for you to do good.
My App, Ruchika Dabbs shared his experiences of testing.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of Electrical Balve, we've read about him in our celebrities.
But today, the light of that electricity is illuminating the lives of the people, that is why the fate of success is incorporated in the failure.
He had no systematic education in the mathematics, no special training.
Harry Potter Series is popular all over the world.
But it wasn't the beginning.
How many problems have they faced - how many failed.
Today, not just students, the entire family, the school and the teachers are involved in this.
But without the collaboration of parents and teachers, the situation is not suitable for the students.
A team of teachers, parents and even senior students will come up with unity and go ahead with the sympathies.
Shri Keshav Vaishno Devi has written in my App, he has complained that parents should not exert more pressure on students to get more numbers.
Just encourage it to be ready.
They have to worry that they are unconscious.
Vijay Jindal wrote, Don't put your hopes on the children.
Encourage their courage as far as possible.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure about one thing that I want to say to my young friends, our present lifestyle has changed a lot from our old age.
We want to move ahead with science at the same speed.
Friends, I am saying this because today National Science Day.
Every year on 18th February, we celebrate the National Science Day.
In February, 1928, Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery "Raman Effect".
He won the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
This is the reason that the day of February is celebrated as National Science Day.
Asked by the creator of science.
Science and psychology creates a new spirit towards science and on the other hand, creation of new thinking is not possible except science and technology.
"I am C.
I salute Raman and urge you all to enhance the interests of science.
Friends, Sometimes it takes too long to achieve success and when success comes, the vision of the world changes.
Perhaps you didn't have a lot of news because you were busy for testing, but I would like to remind the countrymen - you probably heard that there was a very important discovery in the world in science.
Our scientists have identified their efficient gravitational waves.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will try to take this research forward in the future too.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, in the past, we have taken an important decision.
There are only two places in the world.
India is third.
I once again thank all scientists.
My dear countrymen, I am telling you that you will be able to hear my 'Mann Ki Baat' from tomorrow by giving a mid-collection in this number.
You can hear your mother tongue.
The number of missed calls is: 8190881908, I repeat, 8190881908.
Friends, your test is going on.
I have to test tomorrow.
125 crore countrymen will take my exams.
February 29 - It's Lip Year.
But yes, you must have seen me, you know how well I am, how self-confidence.
Yesterday I'll be tested - Parashur will start with you.
If we all succeed, the whole country will be successful.
Thank you very much
This is my last Mann Ki Baat event in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
Just a few days ago, we have greeted Christmas and now we are preparing to welcome the new year.
India is a diverse country.
There are different types of festivals here.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is also associated with festivals.
Festivals are the means of employment for the poorest of the society.
I also congratulate all the people of the country for the Christmas and English for the New Year 2016.
2016 will bring you a lot of happiness.
New joy, new hope, new resolves will bring you to a new height.
Be it terrorism or global warming, be it natural calamities, be it human beings, be it human beings and beliefs, everything is free from all.
You know I use technology completely, so I know a lot.
Many went out to spend the Christmas holidays.
The tourism sector is focused on all other facilities, but he has attracted a special attention, where tourists visit and stay, we should have special interest in keeping the tourist destinations clean.
The more our tourist destinations will be clean the picture of India in the world.
I welcome the thoughts of Shri Sauleshvarkar and give his message to the countrymen.
He has done an innovative job that has been published in the newspaper.
So I think I'll get it to you.
Dileep Singh Malaviya, a small village resident, decided that if a village collects the necessary equipment for the construction of toilets, then he will construct a toilet without a laboratory.
Being sacred, he has built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village so far.
I convey my best wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes our country is heard of destitute.
As a result of the common efforts of all the people, our country is moving fast.
125 crore people are moving forward together and taking the country forward.
We have achieved all this by providing banking opportunities to the citizens, in the era of doing business at the international level, a new reform and infrastructure development in the field of new business.
For the people of the common family who could not reach the bank, I have easily accessed loans through the Mudra Yojana.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted to Yoga exercises and when all the countries of the world were united through International Yoga Day, we believed that this is our country-great India.
When such a feeling is created in our minds then a miraculous picture emerges in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness sounds every household.
The participation of the people is also increasing.
But through my belief and propaganda, the people of this village will reach the entire country with the hopes and aspirations of the people there.
Therefore, the biggest benefit is that all the government employees who are associated with this scheme will be encouraged and happy to think that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the village.
Isn't this good enough to reach farmers, poor, young and women
No government has worked, no government has worked - it is not necessary to reach the news that they cannot be deprived of what they can get.
They must give information about their rights.
We should be aware of the right and good messages used by the common people in large numbers.
It's a kind of service.
I've tried a little to do it like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I say.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and contact me.
Like you, you are also involved in this effort.
I want to reach 125 crore countrymen, it is not possible without your help.
Come, let us all together inspire the common people to reach their common sense of respect and rights.
My dear young friends, from the Red Fort on 15th August, I start up India, stand up.
Since then, every department of the government spreads whether India can become a start up capitulate.
New thinking and new tricks are desirable for every one, because the world cannot move without new innovation.
There are talented young friends in every corner of India, they need only opportunity.
Asked by all the State Governments, we will take this scheme forward.
On 16th January, I will meet you and discuss with you in detail and wait for your advice.
There are crores of people in this country like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda's ideals.
12th January, 1995, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as National Youth Festival.
This year, the festival is going to be held from 12th January to 16th January at Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some advice about this young survival
My special request to the young friends is that you send your advice directly through the Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand your mind.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festival.
Friends, I have been waiting for your approval for the Youth Festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Deep Chauhan, the blind teacher of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, has celebrated the Accessible I India Day in his school.
I have got a very encouraging ride from the students and they have been inspired to help the physically challenged persons in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
You're doing it yourself.
You're well aware of their problems and you're sure you have to face many problems.
When there is an opportunity to meet such people in the society, I have many feelings.
We express our perspective towards their problems as per our thinking.
Some people are victims of accidents.
Some people are bornly victims of physical disability.
A lot of sounds are being used to ensure that all these people are utilised.
But it always seems that the use of such words is not right for these people, it is not honorable.
It's true that the word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Since I was about to be present in that event, I thought I was doing some thoughts about it.
During this time, I feel that God has given something incomplete in his body or whose two organs don't work properly, we call him a handicapped person.
But whenever I meet them, I understand that there is some incompleteness in our eyes, but God has given him some extra power.
These are those people who have one or many organs, who have divine power, who are not in the body of ordinary people like us.
I like this word.
Instead of my appeal to the countrymen, can we propagate the word Dibang
On that day we launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Physical and Vertual: I will try to facilitate the development of these two infrastructure.
We need many things like schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, sloping roads or rimps at railway stations, easier parking and lifting facilities, braille lipid etc.
In our country, gas cylinders have been distributed.
The government has made some changes in this regard.
With the help of Jan Dhan Account, Aadhaar Card etc., the worlds largest largest direct benefit transfer scheme directly reaches the beneficiary bank account.
I am proud to inform the countrymen that it has been ranked in the Genes Book of World Records for successful implementation of the biggest direct benefit scheme.
The project, known as 'Pahal', has been very successful.
By the end of November, approximately 15 crore LPG users have benefitted from the 'Pahal' scheme.
Today, the livelihood of rural people is ensured through the MNREGA scheme.
There was a lot of complaint about the funds provided by the project.
Now, in most places, this money has been directly transferred to the workers' bank account.
There was a lot of problem with the scalarships of the students. There were many complaints.
This facility has also been started for them and it has to be moved slowly.
About 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
According to a general account, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is the Republic Day.
It is a matter of great happiness that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkars 125th birth anniversary of the Constitution this year.
A two-day session of Parliament was scheduled to discuss the Constitution, which is a very good experience.
The Constitution also emphasizes equal emphasis on duty.
There's a lot of duties while voting, but why don't you have to be duties in everyday life
This year, when we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we cannot organize a race of poems, debates and poetry in schools, colleges, villages, cities and various social organisations on the occasion of 26th January.
I am confident that before 26th January, you can write poetry and write poetry about your mother tongue or in English or in Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thinking.
You can send it to my MyGov portal.
I am very keen to know about the consciousness of our youth.
I want to make a small proposal.
On 26th January, when we celebrate the Republic Day, cannot we take the system to clean and decorate the replicas of the great men established in our cities by the students of the citizens and schools and colleges of the country and to maintain cleanliness in the respective areas of revenge
I'm not talking about the government.
As an ordinary citizen, we are as promising and emotional about the replication of these great men.
For the sake of society, cannot we make it our normal practice for the country
On 26th January, let us all be aware of the cleanliness of these replications made in the honor of the great people.
For this, the common man and the citizens will have to come forward in their own way.
My dear countrymen, once again I congratulate you all for the New Year 2016.
Thank you all.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Business and jobs will also be started with new incentives.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also begun.
Festivals have a different significance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to remove condolences, sometimes it creates a new boost.
But sometimes when there is a crisis during the festival, it becomes very sad.
The news of natural misery is coming from everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural misery that never heard or thought before.
During these accidents, I express my condolences and condolences to all these families.
The State Government uses all power in rescue and transportation.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder.
Today, a team of Indian government rescuers have gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that in spite of this danger, Tamil Nadu will move faster at a new pace and he will play the role he plays in taking the country forward.
When the dangers are happening around, the need to resist it is also increasing.
Now he's changed.
In every sector, its capacity building has become a necessity for excellence.
The government, the educated society, the people and all small organisations have to work in a very scientific manner.
I am happy that this initiative was inaugurated through a table talk exercise and the best programme in the Circle of the Circle in Delhi.
You can understand the problems of farmers as well as the biotechnology that is being produced by yourself.
This is our nature and generations after generations, it is working to burn the roots of the crops.
First, there was no idea of the damage that could happen due to this. Everyone is doing this, so we are doing this tradition.
Secondly, there was no training for any other method.
When the impact of these dangers began to fall over the city, people started to move against it.
The sadness you have expressed is perfect.
First of all, we have to give proper training to the farmers and brothers and sisters.
By burning the roots of the crops, the time will be saved, the labour will be saved, the fields will be ready for the next crop but it is not right.
The root of the crop is very precious.
It's a biodiversity.
We're burning the food and destroying it.
Not only this, if these roots are cut off, it can be animals.
The upper layer of farming is burning to burn this root.
The upper surface of our land is burnt, which throws our fertile land to death.
And that's why we have to play a useful role.
Get the roots of this crop on the ground and see it will be cured.
If this biological fertilizer is used in that land, it can be doubled.
I had a chance to talk to the artists once.
They talked of a nice experience.
Earlier when they used to cultivate bananas, they had to spend Rs. 5000 or fifteen thousand each hectare to clean the roots of bananas.
If the tractor wasn't available to clean it, the roots would have fallen in the same way.
Some farmers then put these roots on the ground by pieces of six or eight inches of measurement.
Because there is so much water in the roots of that banana that if there is any tree, tree or harvest, there is no need to give water separately for three months.
The water that is in the roots of bananas saves the crops.
The roots that had to spend their money before cleaning, are now coming from it.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear Countrymen, on December 3, the whole world will celebrate the International Day of Relationship.
Last year I discussed the donation of organs in Mann Ki Baat.
I also spoke of the Helpline of the NOTO for organ donation.
On 27th November, the National Organ Donation Day has emerged.
Several prominent personalities of the society including Chitravinetri Rabina Tandon have been involved in this.
Organ donation can save a valuable life.
They can bring immortality in a way.
When any part of the body is transplanted from one body to another, it gets a new life and that person also gets a new life.
What more can be greater than that
A national level competition was organised through the portal of MyGov.
Physically and mentally restricted people have unlimited courage and power.
But if we change our vision, change our attitude towards them, they can become the inspiration for our lives and work.
We're crying even if we're in small problems.
That's why they are the source of our inspiration.
I express my sincere gratitude to them for their determination, power, their fighting with life and their indecent efforts to transform their problems into power.
I want to talk to you today.
He had to explore some parts of kidney, small intestine and stomach in the terrorists.
There were serious injuries in the spinal cord.
The power to stand on his feet ended like him, but Javed Ahmad didn't give up.
The terrorists couldn't defeat him.
Without any reason, an innocent person has suffered such losses, life and youth have suffered a jeopardy, but Javed Ahmad reacted with sensitivity without expressing any anger or jealousy.
This is his biggest mentality, he has appointed his life in the service of society.
He has been engaged in teaching children for the last twenty years.
Today, we are making a silent revolution as a messenger of socialism and a socialist and conscious citizen.
Can the people of every corner of India not get inspiration from the life of Javed
On 3rd December, I will remember the life of Javed Ahmad, his self-confidence in the penance and human service.
I am speaking of Jabed, but I know that the lamps of inspiration that brighten life in every corner of India, provide a new direction.
On 3rd December, let us remember all those inspirational people.
Our country is a big country.
There are so many things that people depend on the government.
Medieval, under-mediatricity, poor, deprived, suffering, exploited and disadvantaged people have regular relations with the government and the government system.
We have a network of hope workers across the country.
They do a lot of social work in India.
There's a lot of malaria outbreak.
Yamuna Manising, a hopeful worker from this village, has decided not to allow anyone from his own village to die of malaria.
Anyone from the village gets to the house immediately after a small fever.
He started treatment on the basis of the primary treatment he was taught.
Emphasis on the use of pesticides in every home.
Just as we need to sleep and take care of our children, this hope-serviceman Yamuna Manising has completely dedicated himself to save the entire village from mosquitoes and made the entire village to prevent malaria.
How many such jamunas are there -
There are millions of people around us.
We'll try to look at them with respect.
Both can become a major force in the country.
We are always a partner of happiness and sorrow.
I am honoured by all the hopes and workers through Yamuna Manising.
The first is related to Swachh Bharat, the second is related to Adarsh Gram Parliament and the third is health related.
I'm requesting you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You might feel like doing something with it.
Surely send it to Mygov portal.
There are so many things that don't look at us, but there is real strength for society.
The right visual events are our biggest strength.
I invite you, come and join you in the formation of the nation.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is concerned about climate change.
World warming, climate change is now the most illuminating and worrying thing.
The Earth's temperature does not increase - it should be the concern and responsibility of all.
The first way to avoid the increase in temperature is the protection of energy.
I once said that in the night of full moon, the light should be bathed in the full moon for hours by stopping the light of the road.
Those moon rays should be felt.
Any friend sent me a sight link like this and he had a chance to see me.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur, who cannot be seen on TV, has done a lot of studies that perhaps no one thought.
He is working to provide electricity to the poor by using solar power from the sunlight.
He is fighting with darkness and brightening his name.
People take the lips in the evening, go back to the sunshine.
About three to four rupees per day, but there is enough light in the house.
The Nurjahan was recharged by the solar power plant throughout the day.
See, the big people of the world are doing a lot of things for climate change, but one Noorjahan seems to be inspiring all of us, doing the same thing.
In such a way, the name of Nurjahan means to light the world.
He's spreading light in this way.
I would like to congratulate the Honble Prime Minister that he had started a scheme with the Mudra Bank.
The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana is Fund the Unfunded.
Well, the speed at which I want to move, that speed is yet to come.
Most of these helpers are those who are working hard on their feet and are trying to run their families with respect to the penetration of the Tapashis, the Tapashis and other backward classes.
Abhishek himself spoke of his inspiration.
There's a lot of news coming to me.
One told me now, there's someone called Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He has received a loan of Rs. 8.
And he started the piece of cleaning.
During my cleanliness drive, I said that this drive will create a new entrepreneur.
And if Shailesh boils, he showed it.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want this project to be more propagated.
All our banks may be more sensitive and help small businessmen.
In fact, the country's economy is driven by them.
People engaged in small scale work are the real strength of the economy of the country.
We need to emphasize it.
Good, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I spoke of 'One India, Best India'.
There are many things that create awareness in our society.
The International Vigilance in the Private of Liberty (International, Jagrium, Expenditure) will be the prize of Independence.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, this Internal Security River has to be absorbed.
I want to give it the form of a scheme, an India-Shreshtha Bharat.
I've been told that a lot of suggestions have come.
I am told that those who take part in it will be given their certificates.
Big rewards have also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season begins.
This time, it's a good time to wear diet and diverse dress.
But I'll say, exercise.
At least one hour, every family should work together and see how awareness will increase about this and how fresh it will take the whole day.
Good habits in the best season.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you
This is the twelfth edition of Mann Ki Baat.
For the first time on 3nd October last year, I was fortunate to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
Democracy has great glory.
I have a fundamental concern in my life and that is why I have a great faith in my people's power.
Mann Ki Baat has taught me what I know and what I feel, I can say that the power of the people is greater than what we thought.
Our ancestors spoke of public opinion, they are part of God.
I can say in the feelings of Mann Ki Baat that there is great power in the minds of our ancestors because I feel this.
I have asked for advice from everyone for Mann Ki Baat, but I have been able to see or understand two suggestions every time.
But millions of people are actively suggesting me.
It's yourself a great power.
And similarly, Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of publication of our own thinking.
I once talked about selfie with Daughter.
And so the whole world was amazed.
But lakhs of selfies from all over the world have come up with a documentar and the daughters are proud of it.
And when they have made a defect with selfie, they have not only proud of their daughters but have also made a resolve within themselves.
And when the others are looking at these salients, everybody thought they had to leave their sadness towards the daughter-in-law.
People from all corners of India have sent such pictures in large numbers.
The tourism department of the state government or the central government could not even imagine that there is such precious wealth in our country.
It's a little bit, but we're gonna buy it.
Today, I can say with great pleasure that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it wasn't for any government advertisement.
Crores of rupees haven't been spent.
This was a belief of the people's power, a feeling.
I requested the financially entrepreneurs to demonstrate what you have for gas cylinders.
I saw on a TV channel, a widow lady, she is standing on the lines of retiring teachers, gas cylinders.
The middle class, the lower middle class families, who are very difficult to quit, have also left the benefits of Bhartukki.
Isn't this a silent revolution
As much as the government works with the people, he will be able to work as a good guide in the field of improvement of society.
The people of my country are trying to devote themselves to the welfare of the country by emphasizing every small thing.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of taking a new initiative.
Be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumari from Kashmir, there is no place in India where people did not call.
It's my own happiness.
People from all ages have called.
I heard some calls myself and I liked it.
My entire government will work as per your advice.
They gave a positive suggestion.
Look at the work done by the common people of the country, this is a huge wealth for the country.
One or two percent of the phone was probably a serious complaint.
And one thing has come to our notice, especially the skilled persons, especially the blind people, received a lot of phone calls.
One of the reasons for this may be that they don't like watching TVs, so they must listen to the radio.
From this, I understand how important the radio is for the blind people.
I got a new direction from these phones and these phones are very important to make the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and people from all over the country should listen to it.
Listen to what he wants to say, "My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, my belief, your suggestion will spread in the corner of India at the wind speed.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chatti, I had the opportunity to spend two to three hours with the soldiers of the army.
I have enjoyed the safety of water, land and airways, which have spent time with the personnel of the waterways, space and airways, Army, Air Force and Navy.
What wasn't there - the whole history was surviving.
We can achieve this exhibition through the glorious moments of war, which we heard of our army's bravery and sacrifices, because there was no picture that we found, no videography was possible.
The fight of Haji Peer or the fight in the north of the country, the sight of Chamundar fight or Haji Peer Pass Jai, is a thrilling experience and our army is proud of the soldiers.
This exhibition will last a few more days.
I urge you people who are around Delhi to see this exhibition with your family and not hurry like me.
Look at the strength of democracy, a young boy is instructing the Prime Minister, but the young boy has forgotten to call his name in a hurry.
Cleanliness should be adopted and appropriate arrangements should be made for this.
I have to hear a lot of things, that Modi ji speaks very big things about cleanliness, but what's going on finally
On the other hand, on the one hand, the Parliament and on the other hand the children of the country are talking about cleanliness.
The movements that have been created on cleanliness, the atmosphere of hatred towards evil, the awareness that has been created towards cleanliness will also force this government to work towards creating a Swachh Bharat.
The local autonomous body - Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, Pur Nigam, Mahanagar Purana Nigam or State or Centre - each institution has to work in this regard.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will take the right path to achieve the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi says
Mahatma Gandhi once said that freedom and cleanliness - if I have to like one of these two, then first I would like cleanliness and after Independence.
Gandhiji had more importance than freedom.
Come, let us follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfill his wishes.
He wanted to know about Deen Dayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the philosophy of the life of the great people is the source of inspiration.
Sometimes it is associated with the name of some great ancestor in a historical sense.
In the days to come, we will remember these great men, their lives will reach every household and we will try to learn something or the other.
I would like to especially mention the 2nd of October that day, the birthday of revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had also said last year, you have different fashioned clothes, different types of fabricks and many other things, but Khadi goods should have a special place.
And that is why in this Deepawali we will surely give place to our houses and we will wear dresses.
And look, last time the sale of dresses has doubled.
How many poor people have benefited.
The government cannot afford even by advertising lakhs and lakhs of rupees.
This is the manpower and that is why I once again request you for this work.
Dear Countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with happiness.
I want you to be a part of this joy.
I went to Kolkata in May and some of the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose had come to meet me.
His brother-in-law, Chandra Bose, made all arrangements.
There was a chance to spend a few days with the family members of Subhash Babu.
You can imagine how pleasant it is for me.
Maybe they are coming together to the Prime Minister's house for the first time.
But the most satisfactory thing for me is that the Prime Minister's house never had the opportunity to host such guests in the month of October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu who live in different countries are coming.
Bhargavi Kande has sent a message to me. He is going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, "My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to make your youth aware of the registration of voters, which will enhance the contribution of the youth in the coming days and will play an important role in forming and managing the government.
Thank you. "The name is notified in the voter's list and the voter is bhargavi.
Every voter in the Democracy has the privilege of the country and this awareness is growing slowly.
Just a few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission had only conducted the election process but in the last few years it has brought about a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not just an election director but also an assistant, a voter-friendly person, and all his thoughts are the centre of all the projects.
But only the Election Commission will work, it won't work.
I hope that if the newborns of the country do not register their names in the electoral rolls, they will surely register it and will vote.
I speak openly on the day of election. First vote, then drink.
It's a sacred duty. Everyone should do it.
Yesterday, I've visited Kashi.
I met many people, there were many events, many met but I want to tell you about two boys.
But at such a young age, his interest in physics studies surprised me.
I think he's doing a lot of studies, doing internet surfing, knowing about the new use of science.
He talked about how to get rid of the rail accidents, how to reduce the cost of technology and how to reduce the cost of power, how to get the experience of robots etc.
Such a one called Sonampatel meets a small ballikar.
Sonam is nine years old.
I am surprised that the whole Geetha is the girl's voice, but the most important thing is that when I asked her, she was slandering in English, explaining the shloka, listening to Hindi as well.
I asked her father, she said she was doing this since the age of five.
I asked him to study, didn't he just read Geetha or do anything else
The gentleman said, "No, Sonamjee, starting from an angle to the end of the evening, and if history falls, is in the midst of the evening.
They're astonished about the girl, only in the family.
I'm really amazing.
Sometimes there's a feeling of celebrity among children.
I think God has given it a special power.
Sandeep ji, what would you do with me
I have to take a lot of time to try this event once a month.
Sometimes, half an hour of our aviation friends, we have to wait for one hour in the afternoon.
One year of Mann Ki Baat was completed.
Do you know how much Subhas Babu used to use radio
From Germany, he started broadcasting his radio and through radio, he used to repeat the movement of freedom to the people of India.
He launched Azad Hind Radio by a weekly news bulletin.
The radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Puducherry, Urdu etc.
Listen to you, think for you, consider your proposals, and that's why my thoughts are opened, which reach you through the window.
I say, but it's yours, and it's my satisfaction.
Once again, I had the opportunity to visit you in Mann Ki Baat.
The people of far-flung southern India are now celebrating Onam Festival and yesterday the whole country celebrated the Holy Rakhi Bandhan Festival.
The Government of India has launched several new schemes including social security for the common people.
In a short span of time, I am happy that many people who have come under this scheme.
I had requested a small one to provide such a safer scheme to our sisters on the Rakshabandhan Festival.
I got a lot of information from which it is understanding that since the start of the scheme, about 11 crore families have been associated with it.
I was also told that about half of it was available to the mothers and sisters.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken.
Several questions were raised, the work that was not done in the last sixty years, would it be so short
This has helped the youngsters of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this year, 1 lakh 31 thousand financial literacy camps have been opened to collect the banking sector, economy and the low-lying people.
It is believed that the poor people who can get the money from the bank.
I once again express my gratitude to all those associated with it and I request the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts, you will not let this relationship separate from the bank.
This bank is yours, you don't leave it anymore.
I've delivered it to you, now you have the responsibility to hold it.
We're gonna have to keep our accounts in the bank.
I have full faith, you can keep it.
Just a few days ago, the violent incidents of Gujarat surprised the whole country.
And it is natural that if something happens in the state of Gandhi and Sardar Patel, then the whole country is suffering.
But within a very short span of time, the poor citizens of Gujarat - my brothers and sisters have taken care of the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing the situation from becoming uncomfortable and Gujarat has again taken the path of peace.
This path of peace, unity and brotherhood is the right path and we have to move shoulder to shoulder.
Prosperity solves all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the scholars of Sufi streams.
I am telling the truth that this experience of listening to them has brought me a music experience.
The words and words of those pundits, that is, the tradition of peaceful generosity in Sufi, which has reached me like a musical lake.
I'm very happy.
Perhaps this true form of Islam is the most needed to reach the world of tobacco.
My belief, this love and generosity of Sufi tradition will reach far and wide, which will benefit the entire humanity and Islam.
I also say to others, we need to understand Sufi thinking even if we are in different categories.
I am going to have another chance in the coming days and I am fortunate to have this invitation.
Pandits of Buddhism from all over the world are coming to India in Buddhism, they will discuss various aspects of humanity across the globe.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there too.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Buddhaguay.
This moment of meeting with all the scholars of the world is going to be a moment of joy.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you, especially to you.
Earlier, I had spoken about this in Mann Ki Baat programme.
You have heard it in the Parliament, in the public meeting or in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Every time I am talking about the fact that the government's minds are opening up the issue of land acquisition law.
I am willing to take any suggestions for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I want to say that the amendment in the Land Acquisition Act came from the state.
But I saw that there was a lot of misunderstanding about this, the farmers were scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never go wrong and fear will never go.
I don't want anybody to misunderstand the peasants.
I need every claim of the country, but it is also important for the farmers to claim it.
I'm sure I'll let this expire.
I mean, the situation that was before my government was formed came back.
But it was incomplete.
There were 13 such things that were about to be completed within a year and that is why we brought them over and over, but the matter was incomplete.
The welfare of the poor and the farmers in the villages is our guidance.
Therefore, I had said on 15th August that not only the Agriculture Department, but also the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department.
We are trying to transform this decision into a faster way.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason for frustration anymore.
If someone tried to scare you, you won't be afraid.
I have to talk more.
Two days ago, the 1965 war was completed fifty years ago.
Whenever the 1965 war comes, it is natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is very natural to remember the Ministry of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
It is very natural to remember the sacrifices of those who have been martyred for the pride and respect of the tri-coloured national flag of India.
I salute all those associated with the Indian victory of 65 and greet the brave martyrs.
Such a historic event inspires us everyday.
I am happy that India is doing a very good job in various fields of science.
Our scientists are actually doing a good job.
I have seen what young scientists are talking with inspiration and I have seen new dreams in their eyes.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our students should move forward towards science.
After this interaction with the scientists, I felt that there are many opportunities and opportunities in this sector.
I am happy that within just fifteen days, the government has started working in this regard in a short span of time.
Instructions are being made and it is expected that it will be possible to provide interview facilities for small jobs.
Guests from across the globe have come to India.
To reduce health, especially mother and infant mortality, 24 countries of the world have agreed together in the Call to Action Plan of India.
This was the first time in a country outside the US.
It is true that even today we die about 50 thousand mothers and about one million children during childbirth or after that.
It's very worrying and fearful.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, India has been appreciated internationally, yet this number is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we got rid of death due to mother and child tensions.
The whole world recognized it.
But we still have to save mothers and children.
Brothers and sisters, Today the news of dengue is being received.
It's true that dengue is very dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
This is directly linked with the Swachh Bharat that I talk about.
We have advertised on TV with dengue, news papers are printed, but we don't pay attention to it.
Keep the small things in the house clean, the rules to keep the water clean.
There has been widespread public education in this regard but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes it seems that we live in a very clean house, a very good system, but I am inviting dengue to the water accumulated in my house.
I'm asking everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is valuable.
It's not right that the sympathetic attitude towards dirty water around will cause death.
There are about 514 centres in the country where dengue checks are available for free.
It's very important to keep the death tested in time.
Your cooperation in this regard is immense.
Cleanliness has to be very important.
Now there will be many festivals from Rakhibandhan to Deepawali across the country.
You will see that this method of cleanliness will become your habit.
My dear countrymen, today I want to hear a happy news.
I often say that there is no good fortune to give life to our country, but it is fortunate to live for the country.
Two young men of my country, two brothers of Maharashtra, Dr.
Heindra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
There's a cycle race in America, Race Across America, which is very difficult.
I congratulate these two brothers for their best wishes.
I am happy that these two brothers have achieved the goal of Tim Indian Vision for Tribals, which means that they are working for the development of tribals.
See how everybody is working at a personal level to take the country forward.
When you hear all this, the chest swells proudly.
Sometimes, we have done injustice to the new generation by residing in old meditation.
The old generations believe that new generations do not know anything and this conception has been going on for centuries.
I have met a number of young people who have lived on Sunday on the scale.
Some people say, I celebrate a single day in a week.
It is also very useful for my health and environment.
And I like to think of the young man.
Now in many cities of our country, there is a lot of cycling and there is a lot of people who encourage cycling.
This is a great effort to improve environmental protection and health.
Today, I am happy to mention the path of the thoughts and thoughts of the youngsters of India when two young Americans have flagged off the national flag of the country.
I would like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra on this occasion.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's memorial had been built in the land of INDU Mill in Mumbai for a long time.
With this, we have purchased 10 houses of King Henry Road, where Dr. Babasaheb used to be impressive.
The Government of Maharashtra will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This place of London will be an inspiration for those who roam around the world.
I express my gratitude to the Government of Maharashtra for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar.
It's good to start the rain this year.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will be helpful in surgery.
And I'm glad to remember a happy news.
There is a lot of deficiency of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
I want the poor people's pulses, and I want a little oil to make dinner.
It is a matter of great happiness that this time, the amount of pulses has increased by about 50 percent and about 33 percent in oilseeds.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The closer the people of our country are associated with the land of the farmers.
The Kargil war was not just in the border of the country, but in every city of India, in every village, with this war.
This war is also fought by those mothers and sisters whose young boys or brothers were fighting against the enemies in Kargil.
Today, India is able to speak highly over the world for its self-sacrifice.
And today after a year, it is my pleasure that almost two crore people have seen the MyGov portal.
Why cannot you preserve the resistance for the residual persons while booking train tickets through the RCTC website
Now this thing is very small, but it has never been decided by the government or not.
But Bhai Akhilesh Bajpayee's opinion is that the government has considered it very important and today this system has been implemented for our respective brothers and sisters.
Today, the people who are being created, the tag lines are being constructed, the schemes are being formulated, the policies are being formulated.
There is a feeling of a new clean wind in the governance system.
One feels new consciousness.
There are several suggestions in the MyGov portal about what I want to say on 15th August.
Chitra Raghavachari has sent a lot of deliberations from Chennai.
You can send a letter to the MyGov portal, write a letter on the airstrip and write a letter in the Prime Minister's Office.
Look, I believe it's a good thing to get advice from the people and the people for my speech on August 15.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, a scooter driver was scattering for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at the statistics, your heart gets distressed.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to accidents, one person dies every 4 minutes for road accidents.
And the biggest thing is that one-third of these dead people are young people from 15 to 25 years of age, and one death can destroy the entire family.
They will do whatever the administration has to do, but I request my parents, your children should be on behalf of the family for care and care.
Sometimes I see, the auto-rickshaw has been written behind, "Go to your father's house" (Go back home soon) - How marvelous is this writing
And that is why I say that the government has taken a lot of initiatives in this regard - whether it is educational about road safety, whether it is a professional system of road safety, administrative system or whether it is an immediate treatment system for those injured after accidents, we are bringing road transport and safety bills.
I am contemplating to take some important steps to use the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan in the coming days.
I have taken up another scheme that will benefit from all the highways from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Baroda to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaam and Mondia.
I am thinking of a cashless medical system for the first 50 hours of the accident - whether the injured person has any money, who will pay, who will not pay, who will leave all these concerns, who will get better health care and who will get the primary treatment.
I have arranged a toll-free number 1033, an ambulance to provide information about the accidents across the country.
Sometimes I say that the employees are working.
In the last few days, I want to tell you what I like.
Vijay Vishal has shown how to connect his own interest, his industry and his power with his work.
In the coming days, there will be a lot of discussions like Vijay Viswal's picture.
I also remember one more thing that the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh had started a work in the entire district which touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they have been serving that during the Rakshabandhan Festival so that all the brothers and sisters get their sisters toilets and no mothers and sisters in the entire district have to go to the open space.
I know a news that I want to share with you.
There is a small village named Kesala in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been campaigning for toilets for the last few months.
Now no one in this village has to make an open defecation place.
After the completion of the toilets, the entire village has celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is an excellent example of how the society is changing the values of life, how the mindset of the people is changing, how the citizens of the country are moving forward.
About North-East India, Guwahati Bhavesh Deka has written to me that it is very active in the functioning of the people of North East India.
They're writing a lot - it's a good thing.
Today, I would like to tell them that there is a separate Ministry for North-East India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate Ministry called Development of North-East Region (DoNER) was formed.
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department takes an important decision that development of North-East India cannot be done in Delhi.
Everyone decides that a team of officers of the Government of India will go to the states of North-East India like Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam Sikkim etc. and remain camped for seven days.
The efforts to move from Delhi to the East, which I am calling the Act East Policy, must be taken forward.
My dear countrymen, we are happy with the success of Merce Mission and we are proud.
In the past, India's PSLV C28 successfully launched five satellites of the United Kingdom.
All this news comes for a few moments and goes back.
We generally don't remember these.
But sometimes, when we talk to the youngsters and know what they want to be in the future, one or half of the students are found who say, I want to be a scientist.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has launched a National Merit Research Expedition in search of a new talent.
Now you have to go to another village if you're charging a mobile.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started the Dindayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana.
But we have to work more for the poor.
We'll complete it.
I have started it, I will also finish it and today I have the desire to talk about various things.
On the one hand, the month of August-September is celebrated in our country.
Several festivals are also celebrated.
My best wishes to all of you.
Send your advice on August 15.
I'm gonna be very useful for you.
Thank you so much
When I told you, I didn't think I could get such a remarkable ride.
Millions of people have photographed in Towitter, Festival, Instagram.
After all, we saw a photo, how many varieties are there in India - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers and seas.
I think you have done the great thing that the Government of India could not think of for tourism.
And I like some pictures so much that I've visited myself again.
I believe that if we don't post the photographs of the Belum Cave in Andhra Pradesh, we couldn't have known the places hidden in our country.
But the scene we saw on 21st June is very strange and I think there was no country where the sunlight reached.
I can tell you, the sun doesn't die in the world of yoga.
Every Indian is proud of the way people of the world have respected and made Yoga healthy.
I'm also very happy.
The Sin river and the Imphal Tower are the symbols of pride for the people of France, and they have also given equal respect to the Yoga that they like for Yoga.
People in New York's Times Square have practiced Yoga.
As Australia's Sydney talks, Opera House's pictures are sliding in the eyes.
The people of Australia have practiced Yoga in the Opera House and have given equal respect to the Opera House.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Milan's Duomo Cathedral - Yoga has proud of us everywhere.
I am glad that when the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr.
Similarly, the members of the Peace Keepers of the United Nations have performed very beautiful Yoga practices.
Our soldiers have gained Yoga on the white ice sheet in Siachen of India, where our boatmen were in the sea, they participated in the Yoga process.
Yoga practices in Delhi have been ranked in Gineshbuk of World Records.
It seems that a new question from everywhere in the world - a new joy - a new spirit - a new soul is coming up.
A few days ago, when I visited the tournament in Vietnam, a small family of Vietnam, the photo was so beautiful that it was appreciated all over the world.
Women, children and children, villages and cities, well-developed or developing countries have joined themselves with Yoga.
Yoga is truly bound by the whole world.
I don't know how scholars and gentlemen will look at this incident but one thing I am feeling that every Indian can proud that the whole world is interested in knowing India.
Everyone is interested in knowing India.
India wants to know the values, traditions, heritage and the world.
The responsibility of all of us is not to keep this heritage in mind.
We can do this if we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we know something so much that we cannot see any innovation like our family values, we dont know that our family values are important to the people of the world.
Why wouldn't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe that the world will be surprising - I will be surprising that there are many such best things that the ancestors have given us.
The success of the International Day of Yoga brought a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
We are responsible for giving good Yoga to the world.
I believe you can create a database in this regard.
We have seen the consequences of the government, the government is working, the government is very active and the vision is sustained.
When we were despairing around us, just like we heard a year ago, nothing will happen.
Ayush is a part of the government.
Nobody has given any attention to this
But on the day of Yoga Day, this small section, which has been lying in a corner, has led and has organized such a big event in the entire world.
If the goal is fixed, the smaller departments can also do good work.
Just a few days ago, the world saw how our people saved the people who were suppressed by Yemen.
Within a few hours, Indians moved towards helping Nepal.
If the government is active then the employees of all the banks come forward to open the Jan Dhan Account in the bank and within a few days, millions of people are connected with the bank.
On 15th August, I requested to build toilets in all the schools in the Red Fort and said that we have to complete this work in the next 15th August.
It was a great bravery to invite the completion of the work that was not possible in sixty years.
That is, the government, the common man, the government employees - all want to work for the country.
Last month, I started three Jan-Security Projects from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been involved in the Jan Suraksha Yojana, though we have to take this scheme further.
Rakhi Bandhan Festival coming in August.
We cannot help our mothers and sisters in making a strong public movement before this festival together.
On the occasion of Rakhi Bandhan, it can be a huge gift for brothers and sisters.
When I came to the Mann Ki Baat program, many people sent me advice.
Many people have advised me to tell me something about the rain.
Yogesh Dandekar from Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan Mahasay from Mysore, Pravin Nadkarni Mahasay, Divya Kupta Mahasayam - everybody told me something about the rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This season pleases the heart.
People of any age want to enjoy the first rain water.
You are also enjoying hot cooking, fresh and cooked hot tea in this year.
Just as the sun rays give us life, the rain gives us strength.
Point drops of water are also valuable.
As a citizen, we have to create a habit of saving water as a people of the society.
The water of the village will remain in the village, the water of the city - this should be our resolve.
Rain Water Harvesting is not a new thing for centuries.
Chack Dam, watershed development, small ponds, small streams of the fields - whatever we want to save the drops of water.
The Porbandar is beside the sea, so the rain water was stored in the house for sweet water.
At that time, such efforts were made to save the water of the rain.
We can do that too.
And I advise you to get from my direct and successful experience.
It's entirely a rural craft.
When you plant trees, put an old clay on the tree and fill it with water.
It's gonna be watering once or twice a month.
See this tree will grow very fast and will be very strong.
I'll tell the farmers that you don't plant trees on your fields.
And we also know that in the rainy season the disease spreads more through water.
Bacteria are active due to increase in moisture during the season.
Therefore, cleanliness is extremely important at this time.
Drink pure drinking water this time.
It's okay, we'll be as careful as the disease is.
I want water, I want rain, but I want to save you from the disease.
My countrymen, we have started three new projects recently, especially for the people of the city.
There are five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want to stay in this house for electricity, drinking water, toilets and school for children.
When India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want to give every citizen our homes.
I have joined you all with the help of social media.
You can get suggestions and new ideas and suggestions from yourselves. I am also happy about the government's work.
But when this government scheme is implemented by a person, a society or a village, its strength increases.
In the past, a Panchayat head of Bibipur village of Haryana, Shri Sunil Jaglan Mahasay has started a very funny effort.
And this creates an environment that every father wants to put a cell phone with his daughter and post it on social media.
In Haryana, the number of sands is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there is such a situation which is very worrisome.
Harriya's situation is the worst.
And that is why I appeal to you, you also participate in Selfie with your daughters.
Write a tagline to further strengthen the 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' scheme. Write a beautiful tagline which can be in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I'll restore your selfie to your daughter.
We all can make this scheme a mass movement in a way.
Make our country a funeral.
I'm telling you from my experience, you're taking this effort forward.
Make it part of your life.
And one thing - Incredible India - you will definitely send pictures wherever you go.
Our country- Do all such worlds know how much diversity is there in our country
I believe that the pictures that you are sending, the handicrafts related to handicrafts have come very little.
You can also post the handicrafts of your area in Incredible India.
Your city produces a variety of things - the poor people also create a variety of things.
And we have a simple medium with which we can reach.
My dear countrymen, this is all today.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be interacting with you again.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to announce the governments big projects but not that.
I'm working day and night.
Through this program, I'm talking to you slightly sweetly, the bass is my joy
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine what's going on in the middle.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, though I used to say, my voices, my voices, my voices, my voices, my voices, but your words, your men, yours and yourselves were yours.
But this Sunday has waited for me a lot.
Well, it's the last chance.
In a household environment, the word Mann Ki Baat, that is, the reason for changes in society and life, its continuity is a new inspiration and thus strengthening the spirit of a New India.
My deliberate exchange with you was an experienced part of this spiritual journey.
Many people asked me why I went to Kedarnath in that busy vote.
You have the right and I can understand this curiosity.
I guess I'd like to tell you about the situation at that time.
But today I believe that if I talk about it then the size of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Polling remains when I was out.
Most of the people found political meanings.
But for me it was an opportunity to meet you.
Maybe I went to meet me.
I don't know, but I'm sure you have the right to tell me.
As people have expressed their desire to know about the Kedars, I feel like you all the time in your efforts.
Sometimes some of your words make my thoughts sharp.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by the people like the nation and the society.
I have noticed that there is a description of the problem in the letter but there is also a special feature that some solution, some suggestions, some imaginations are given directly or indirectly.
If someone writes about cleanliness, he also welcomed his efforts towards cleanliness and expressed his disgust over the dirty defects.
When someone talks about the environment, he also spoke of his efforts while feeling sad about pollution.
He also mentioned the way it is being adopted, and the imagination that he has remembered is against environmental pollution.
That is, a glimpse of how to solve the problem with the entire society can be achieved through your conversation.
Mann Ki Baat is like a vision to the nation and the society.
This tells us that there is no dearth of internal strength, ability and privilege amongst the people of the country.
Just need to guide the power and talent, give them the opportunity to use it.
Mann Ki Baat says that in the progress of the country, 130 crore countrymen will have to add strength and activism.
I would like to say one more thing that in Mann Ki Baat, I have a lot of letters, innumerable phones, a lot of messages, but there is a lot of complaints.
You can imagine that someone has written a letter to the Prime Minister of the country but doesn't you want anything for yourself
This is an example of the high vision of millions of people of the country.
Today my heart is full of happiness.
And that is why I easily announced in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will return to you.
Let us take this idea forward and take forward the continuity of Mann Ki Baat.
The movement against him was not limited to political circles, political leaders, prisons.
I don't feel hungry when we can eat time and time.
Just likewise, the importance of democracy in everyday life is felt only when that right is lost.
And this is not because the Constitution of India has taken some steps that will enhance democracy.
There is a need for constitution and legislation to ensure that the society is properly driven.
And that is why the country dedicated to the entire nation, not only for itself but for the protection of democracy.
Recently, the massive election process of Democracy was completed in our country, where wealthy and poor, everyone was ready to take part in this campaign and decide the future of the country.
When something is close to us, we cannot achieve its importance
More than 61 crore people voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
The number seems to be normal, but if you look closer to the world, I will say, without a single sign, more people than any country in the world voted in India.
The number of people who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is almost double the number of people in the US.
The total number of voters in India is more than the total number of Europeans.
These are the catalysts of the vastness and enormity of our democracy.
The Lok Sabha elections of 2019 are the largest democratic elections in history so far.
You can imagine what is the need for massive organisations and human resources to complete this process.
This election has been possible for the hard work of more than a million teachers, officials and workers.
On the one hand, about three lakh defence personnel of the Armed Forces have performed their responsibility, while 20 lakh police personnel of different states have worked hard on the other hand.
As a result of their hard work, this time more than the previous elections have been voted.
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than forty lakh EVM machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines are planned.
To ensure that no one is deprived of using his vote.
The polling station is being constructed for only one female voter at one place in Arunachal Pradesh.
You might be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials have to travel for two days to reach that place.
That's the true honor of democracy.
The highest number of polling stations in the world are also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
There is more information about which we can be proud.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of men and women voters in this election is almost equal.
One more inspiring information is that there are 78 women MPs in the Parliament who have a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the voting process and greetings to the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have listened to me many times. Not Book but Book.
I'd like to finish the habitat if the flowers could be booked instead of breaking them
Another story that drags my heart deeply is 'Eidgah'.
The story is a boy's sympathy, a good love for his grandmother.
When Hamid takes a pinch for his grandmother from the fair of four-five years, it really feels like the love and affection of the human mind.
The last line of this story is an incomplete truth of life that teaches us.
Such a very heart touching story is Puss Ki Rat.
This story shows a strange picture of the life of a poor farmer.
The farmers are happy even after their crops are lost, because they don't have to sleep in the wilderness of winter.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, its relevance still explores the same.
After reading the story, I feel a different kind.
When it comes to reading books, in a media, I read about Kerala's Akshara Library.
You might be surprised to know that the library is situated in a village in the dense forest of Idukki.
A primary school teacher, P.
V. Chinnathambi worked extraordinary for this library.
There was a time when the books were brought here by putting it on the back and putting it on the back.
Today, this library is giving a new direction to the tribal children and everyone.
Gujarat, Wangch Gujarat, a successful initiative.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, at the time of Google Guru, I would also request you to take some time and give some place to the book on your daily routine.
You will really enjoy and write in the NarendraModiApp that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat are aware of the books that you read.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of my country are thinking about all those things which are not just present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on the NarendraModiApp and MyGov.
Belgavir Pawan Gowda, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar and Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related problems.
Water has a great impact on our culture.
It has been stated about the water in the supreme supplication of the Rikveda that it has been said that it has not been possible for us to do so in the sportspersons, or in the sportspersons.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are getting damaged every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water received from the rainy season is saved in our country.
Only 8 percent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that like other problems, we will find solutions to this crisis with the strength of the people, with the strength of 130 crore countrymen, with the help of cooperation and determination.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country.
This will facilitate immediate decision-making of water related matters.
A few days ago, I tried to innovate something different.
I wrote a letter to all the village heads of the country.
I had written to the villagers to save water, to save every drop of rain and to save every drop of rain.
I am glad that they have made full motivations in this regard and on the 22nd of the month, crores of people have worked in thousands of panchayats.
People in villages have decided to save one drop of water.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I want to listen to a village panchayat.
Listen to what the Panchayat chief of Lupung village of Katkamshandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us a message. My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there were once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
My best wishes to all the village heads, all the Panchayat heads, for their activeness.
There are many Panchayats across the country who have been initiated in water conservation.
What I said, it is possible to achieve a very positive outcome in every effort.
But everyone's goal is to save water, save water.
The construction of water drainage in Punjab is underway.
This helps in getting rid of the problem of water accumulation.
The creation of a stream in Thimaipalli, Telengana, is changing the lives of the people of the village.
There has been a major change in the construction of small lakes built in the fields of Kavidardham in Rajasthan.
I was talking about a public effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20 thousand women have come together to revive Nagandi.
I was also reading about the women of Garhwal who are doing a very beautiful job to keep the rain water together.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat program, I request three people of the country.
My first request is: Just as the countrymen gave cleanliness a mass movement, let us launch a mass movement for water conservation.
Together we all resolve to save every drop of water, I believe that water is the form of prasad, water from God.
I initiate a awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Whether it is the world of films, sports, media friends, people associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, artists, everybody should lead this movement through their own way.
Awakening the society, connecting everybody and connecting it.
You see, we'll see changes in your eyes.
Come, let us create a list of water conservation methods and inspire people to save water.
You can share your content using Hashtag Janshakti4jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I thank you and all the people of the world for one more thing.
Just as on 21st June, once again on Yoga Day, three-thirds or four-four generations of each family, full of enthusiasm, have celebrated Yoga Day.
The significance of Yoga Day is increasing in the wake of the awareness that has come from the Holistic Health Care.
If Yoga lovers welcome the sun from every corner of the world, then their journey will end with the sunset.
The President of the various countries of the world, the Prime Minister, the well-known personality and the common man have shown me how they celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
That day, the world looked like a large family full of happiness.
We all know that the need for a healthy society, a healthy and sensitive person is to ensure Yoga.
Therefore, the promotion and promotion of Yoga is an integral part of social service.
In 2019, Prime Ministers Awards were announced for the unique contribution of Yoga in the development and development of Yoga, which is of course a good news for me.
These awards have been awarded to the organizations of the world who have played an important role in spreading and spreading Yoga.
Just like Japan Yoga Niketan can be said, who have made Yoga very popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan has a number of institutions and training courses.
And where can Indians stay behind in Yoga
Yoga Schools of Munger, Bihar, which have been displayed for the last few decades, have been honored.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Munich was also honored who established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
And those who have received the message of Yoga at home, they have been honored with a different dimension in Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, today our journey has started with new ideas, new experiences, new resolves and innovative energy, I have waited for your well-known opinion.
I am sure that you can connect yourself with your thoughts, the important thing for me is the Mann Ki Baat.
Be your blessings with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Come, let us all sit together and listen to the Mann Ki Baat program and take all the responsibility of life.
In the next month, Mann Ki Baat will be interacting with you again.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is filled with the start of Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Bharat Mata lost her brave saints.
To address this challenge in front of the country, we all have to forget caste, communalism, regionalism and all other similarities so that we can take stronger, stronger and more fruitful steps than ever before against terrorism.
Our armed forces are indicative of indomitable courage.
You've seen what steps have been taken within 100 hours of the terror.
The army has resolved how to destroy the terrorists and their alcoholists.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, through media, inspiring messages from his family were brought to the forefront of inspiring courage, encouragement and strength among the people of the entire country.
The father of Shahid Ratan Thakur in Bhagalpur, Bihar, Ramniranjan ji, has inspired us to introduce a strong commitment to this sad moment.
He said that his other son will also be sent to fight against the enemies of the country and if necessary, he will be present in the battlefield.
The entire country conveys the unforgettable courage of the martyr Prasanna Sahu's wife, Meena Ji, in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He has decided to contribute his only son to the CRPF.
When martyr Vijay Soren's dead body covered with national flags reaches Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son says he will also join the army.
With the spirit of this unsuccessful child, this strong resolve, the thoughts of the young children of India today reflect.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial waiting for all of us for so long since independence is going to end.
It is very natural for the countrymen to have a lot of questions and recommendations in this regard.
The Prime Minister expressed his happiness at the creation of the National War Memorial at Odupi, Karnataka.
I was surprised and distressed that there was no National War Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai, was born on February 22.
You all know that this special day comes once in four years.
In a simple, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most loyal leaders of the country.
In our independent India, the record of getting the maximum budget in the Parliament has been named after Morarji Bhai Deshai.
During that difficult period, Morarji gave the right leadership to India, while the democracy of the country was in a critical position.
Morarji Bhai dedicated himself to the movement against the necessity to protect this democracy.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of money.
That day the government arrested him and pulled him into the prison.
But when Janta Party was elected in 1977, he became our Prime Minister.
44th Constitution Revision was proposed during his Prime Minister's tenure.
The event is very important because the 42nd revision is proposed for the necessary situation, where there were some more proposals to exclude the power of the Supreme Court and to ensure that our democratic values were ruined.
As a result of the 44th Amendment Proposal, the news of the work done by the Parliament and the Legislative Assembly has been made public in the newspapers.
Besides, some of the powers of the Supreme Court are maintained and it is proposed that the basic rights of the citizens should not be hampered due to the necessity in comparison to the 20th and 21st of the Constitution.
Today, once again, I pay my tribute to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, people had a lot of enthusiasm about the Padma Awards.
I want to tell you something like this today.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering of Abdul Ghafu Khatdi ji in Gujarat. He worked astonishing to revive the traditional rogan artwork of Kutch.
He has done an excellent job to bring this rare industry to a new generation.
I gifted former US President Barack Obama to Tri of Life, built by Abdul Ghafur.
Among the Padma Awardees, everyone knows Sabbir Sayid of Marathwada as Gomata Sevak.
The way he delivered his entire life to the service of Mother Gomma, he is unique.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, a distinguished person who tried to empower and self-reliant the exploited through the Kalanjium movement in Tamil Nadu.
He has also trained people from all over the world at a age of one hundred and has made 1500 Yoga Teachers.
He did not only save 50 hectares of jungles, but also sent ten thousand women together to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamuna, today the people of the village make 18 at the time of birth of every child and plant 10 trees at the time of marriage of every girl.
He dedicated himself with the pledge to self-reliantizing the blind children by creating an institution called Chakhu Mahila Sevakunj.
My dear countrymen, this is probably the first time that 12 farmers have been awarded this year.
Normally, very few people associated with agriculture and those who are directly connected to the farming sector are very few in the list of Padma Shri.
And this is the vibrant picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I will tell you a heart touching experience with you all, I have achieved myself for the last few days.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM-JYA and PMJAY.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme.
I understand that this has brought about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If you know any poor person who cannot be treated for lack of money, tell them about this scheme.
The scheme has been implemented for the benefit of the poorest of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters are going to start exams in school.
Several educational boards across the country will start preparations for the examination of Parliamentarians and twelve-class boards.
My best wishes to the test takers, their parents and the teachers.
A few days ago, the Pariksha Pe Charcha in Delhi was organized in Town Formate.
I am grateful to all the students, their teachers, their parents, YouTube, for the recording of this programme.
My dear countrymen, India will talk about it and it will not talk about its worship.
Perhaps there is no day in our country when there is no festival or festival or any special significance, because we are with us a thousand years old heritage.
And in a few days, Mahashivaratri has come and this time, Shivaratri has fallen on Monday and when Shivaratri falls together, our hearts feel sacred and sacred.
I am extremely impressed with the power of this bankruptcy.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience to connect with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through radio, I meet millions of families every month.
Sometimes you have to read your letters, talk to you, or you have been sent to the phone, listening to the suggestions, you have made me one of your family.
It's a very happy feeling.
Friends, The biggest festival of elections is democracy.
We'll be busy with the elections for the next two months.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
The entire life of mankind, shelter, education and psychology was demonstrated.
The Siddhaganga Monastery is the organiser of the Ankrishimela.
I once convey my heartfelt condolences to such a great man.
But today I'm gonna tell you something else.
Imagine, just for a sword.
If you're unable to get rid of any reason, then you're gonna have to get rid of yourself.
I am aware of the challenges faced by countless people of the country, including the enrollment of the AMRUSWAMILEVING OF THE LINGING OF THE INDIA.
I believe that a large number of young-young-young-young-young-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellows will strengthen our democracy.
This is where the English rulers were the doctors of Bharat Maa's Santankarnal Premshehgal, Karnelgurubux Singh Dhilan and Menage General Shahnawaz.
When I was looking at Netaji's relevant generosity at the Kranti Mandir of Lal Kolla, Netaji's family members used to take me a special advantage.
Netanyaji used to use this.
This TUPTION I've arranged the sympathetic gallery so that the common man looks at the sympathetic gallery and inspires the people.
The gloriousness of our countrymen, the myth of the people of our country is the integral medium of our generations.
In this month, I had visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
But that was the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hindson's Working Group.
"Delhi Chalo, your blood donation, I am your freedom", the responsibilities of NetajiSamast Bharat.
There's been a few years since Netaji would have been the public.
I'm enjoying us.
The day I am here, when Netaji was in the house of the Prime Minister.
I have been communicated with the radio stations in weekly interactions like Yangregi, Hindi, Tamil, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Puducherry, Northeast.
The Business was in the magnificent land.
The museum has witnessed a historical exhibition and the Art World has been preserved in 450 years old.
It has been displayed in the best craftsmen like Amritasargil, Raja Ravi Varma, Abnendranath Takur, Gaganendranath Takur, Nandlal Bose, Jimini, Shailaj Mukherjee.
He has created a number of poisoning.
He has also called upon the birds and has already made many natural beauty, and has taken the Nihuman Character through Culture Canvas-Affute.
And it is surprising that the part of this craftsmanship of Gurudev Rabindranath Taku is not known.
He believed that the paintings of the audience should be considered by the engineers and the craftsmen should be seen by the artists.
Orphanning is also seen in Europe and abroad in Russia and America.
I'd like you to visit the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, the land of the Indian saints.
Our saints have advocated interactions and communicative efficiency through exchanges.
That's how he was...
The 19th century of the University.
Last 24-September, our brothers and sisters have been expediting the Kalam-Sat.
The students of Orissa University have transformed the 'SoundingRecent'.
Since the country's independence, since the year 2014, the Mahakaashavya has reached almost four years.
We've transformed the world's world's records from a spacecraft to 104-Tsatellite satellite.
We are swiftly making India's Parakha in the midst of the Chandrayaan-2 movement.
The Housing Far Old (Housing Far Old) i. e.
In this context, Geo Tagkaraha has also taken up Trincomotives under the Manrega.
Our satellites reflect the growing power of the country.
We are also in the field of collaboration with the world.

They're on the farmshop.
Normally, I don't want you to know what you're talking about.
ASEANSOLNING OF ANDIA YOUTHGEMS ASERVENTS OF THE WHOUNDIA SOUTHGEMS

The legends of the sportspersons of the sportspersons of Khelo India are not only the mankind of Badshaharbah, but also the children of small towns, muffles, villages from Aasasishu, young friends.

I am happy to learn from the Anshulasharmygov in Himachal Pradesh.
Antula ji, thank you for this thing.
Yeah, it's just a few weeks since this trial is over.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering on the occasion.
I extend my best wishes to each student, his parents and teachers.
Today's Mankivat programme will tell me about this, but I will tell the examineees of the country at the inauguration of the Pariksha Parcha in the coming 229-Seh-Seh-Seh-Benjain.
I would like to tell you about the solutions related to the tests, particularly the stress free exams.
In this regard, I tried to convince the people and I am convinced that it is the best of the people.
We're here, there's a two-minute dedication to the martyrs.
We will inform the people of the dreams of the revered Bapu, the creation of a New India and the responsibility of the citizens.
Mann Ki Baat, December, 2018
We're going to enter 2019.
Can we take such initiatives so that we can change our lives and take the country and society forward
Many congratulations to you all for the year 2019.
Ayushman Bharat, the worlds largest healthcare scheme, was launched in 2018.
Electricity has reached every village in the country.
The world's top institutions have acknowledged that India is moving forward towards making the country free of poverty at record speed.
The Swachhta Abhiyan is reaching out to 95 per cent of the countrys unprecedented commitment.
After Independence, the national flag was hoisted for the first time in the 75th anniversary of Azad Hind Government from Red Fort.
The statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the world's tallest statue of Statue of Unity, which was engraved in the spirit of unity, has brightened the name of India all over the world.
India has been awarded the highest environmental award Champions of the Earth.
Indias efforts to prevent solar energy and climate change have been appreciated by the entire world.
International Solar Alliance was organised.
As a result of the universal efforts, our country has achieved unprecedented success in Ease of Doing Business ranking.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by visiting the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway was inaugurated in Varanasi.
This has resulted in a vast change in waterway transport.
The country's longest railroad Bogibeel Bridge has been opened for the masses and the launch of the first and the country's 100th airport Pack-Eyang has been completed.
India has won 19 cricket sports and Blind cricket sports sports.
India has won a number of medals in the Asian Games.
The Para-ASEAN Games have also improved the results of India.
But if I talk about the achievements of every Indian and all our efforts then the Mann Ki Baat program will be so long that it will start in 2019.
All this is possible in the unprecedented efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, in December, we lost some excellent countrymen.
On 19th December, Dr. Jaya Chandran died in Chennai.
Narsamma was a blessing to deliver the pregnant mother and sister.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was awarded the Padma Shri.
Dr. Jaya Chandran and Sulagiti Narasamma have many distinguished personalities who have served their lives for the betterment of society.
When I talk about healthcare, I want to mention the social efforts of doctors in Uttar Pradesh's vision.
A few days ago, some of my party officials tell me that some young doctors in the city are treating the poor for free.
Now every month hundreds of poor people are benefiting from this camp.
The incentives of these doctors who are selflessly served are commendable.
Today, I can say with pride that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign due to our collective efforts.
Some people have told me that a few days back, more than three lakh people join the Swachhta Abhiyan in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
This great achievement of cleanliness includes citizenship, voluntary organizations, school-class students and the common people of Jabalpur.
This is where I know about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever it comes to time, I try to go to the Better India Dot Com website and know about this kind of encouraging thing.
I am happy that there are several such websites today that introduce us to the lifestyle of inspirational people.
Through Sanskrit Bharati Dot In, you can easily learn Sanskrit language by sitting at home.
My belief is that many people will know about these heroes who brought about changes in society.
It is easier to spread negativity, but there is a lot of good work in our society around us and it is possible that 130 crore Indians are involved in this effort.
Every society has a different importance of sports.
Whenever a game is played, the audience also gets a joyous transformation.
I want to tell you about Hanuman Nissar, a daughter from Kashmir, who won the Gold medal in Carate Championships in Korea.
Twenty-fourth Annual Hanuman remains in Kashmir.
I wish all the countrymen their bright future.
Rail is very greetings and blessings for her.
Similarly, there is a lot of discussion in the media about another daughter, Sixteenth Rajini.
You must have fallen.
Rani Girls won gold medals at Junior Boxing Championships.
He is honored with his father, Jassem Singh, who sells Lassi at a waterway shop.
The queen told her that her father had to accept a lot of sacrifice and suffering to reach this place.
Jesus Christ went to work every day before the queen and his brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajini wishes to teach boxing to her father, to encourage her, to fulfill her dreams.
The royal boxing practices started with old gloves, because then his family's financial condition was not good.
Despite all the opponents, Rajini does not lose courage and teaches boxing.
He won a medal in Serbia too.
With my best wishes and blessings to Rajini, my best wishes to her parents, Jassem Singh ji and Usharani, to be close to Rajini and to encourage her.
This month, Bedangi Kulkarni, who was twenty years old, had the pride of being the fastest Asian in the world.
He ran about 300 kilometers of cycle every day for 159 days.
You imagine, 300 kilometers of cycling every day
His incentive to driving the cycle is really praiseworthy.
Resistance never stops.
When we heard of other such examples, we also get inspiration in every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, many festivals of enthusiasm and joy in January are like Lohadi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttaran, Magh Bihu, Maghhi etc.
In all these festivals, the color of traditional dance will be seen all over India, and will be burnt with the pleasure of harvesting crops.
The sports event will be organised somewhere, and it will be replaced somewhere, the festival of sweetening each other with sweets.
Even though the names of these festivals are different, the objective of festivals is to celebrate, these festivals are somehow associated with agriculture and rural life.
This is the time when the sun rises and the sun goes into the moonlight.
Since then, the day starts growing gradually and the winter season starts.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the farmers and brothers of our foodgrains.
Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, the unity among the diversity, is in the magnificent festival of this thought.
We can see how indiscriminate these festivals are associated with nature.
The society and nature are not seen separately in Indian culture, a group of people and people here.
Another beautiful example of our integrity with nature is Festival Calendar.
These calendars also contain the details of the planet and volume throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with the events related to natural and geographical science.
The Moon-Surya Calendar, based on the pace of the moon and the sun, sets the date of festivals and festivals.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
In many places, the festival is scheduled to be held on the ground floor.
The festivals like Gudi-Padwa, Cheti-Chand, Ugadi are celebrated according to the Moon Calendar, similarly Tamil Puthandu and Vishnu, Vaishali, Vaishali, Pilla Vaishak, Bihu etc. are celebrated according to the Sun Calendar.
Many of us have a special objective to protect rivers and water in Parvan.
Chhat Parvati rivers and reservoirs are connected with sun worship.
In Makar Sankranti, more than a million people take bath in the holy rivers.
Our festivals and festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, as they have a mythological significance, on the other hand, every festival inspires and inspires each other to create fraternity with each other in a very easier life.
I extend my best wishes and wishes to all of you on the occasion of 2019.
You can share the photos that are being taken for this festival with all of you so that the beauty of Indias diversity and Indian culture can be seen.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of things in our culture that we can proud of and we can enhance the world by enlightening it.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
In many cinemas, this fair has been depicted on the heritage and vastness of the fair and it is true, the greater the form of the Kumbh, the richer the more important it is.
People from all over the country and across the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
This Kumbh is a celebration of faith and reverence.
Millions of people from all over the country are meeting together.
The tradition of Kumbh has been purified and purified by our great cultural heritage.
Saints and great men have started reaching Kumbh.
Last year, the UNESCO Kumbh Mela was nominated in the Intellectual Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the ambassadors of many countries have seen preparations for the Kumbh.
There was a national flag hoisting of several countries together.
There is a possibility of more than half a hundred people coming to the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.
This can be a very big learning experiment especially for the youth.
I went to Prayagraj a few days ago.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh.
This time the Kumbh is also emphasizing on cleanliness.
This accomplishment of human belief was closed in the fort for thousands of years, so pilgrims could not see it even if they wanted.
Now the doors of the axis have been opened for everyone.
I appeal to you that when you visit the Kumbh, you must share different features and pictures of Kumbh in the social media so that more and more people are inspired to go to Kumbh.
This Kumbh of spirituality may be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh of faith may be the Mahakumbh of nationalism and national harmony.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, the celebration of the Republic Day remains very fond of the people of the country and on that day we recall the great people who presented our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the centenary of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu.
For us, the President of South Africa, Shri Sirile Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the chief guest of the Republic Day.
Popular Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohan became the Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi had launched the first Satyagraha and stood firmly against casteism.
He set up Finnics and Tolstoy Farm from where the voices of peace and silence were raised all over the world.
He had the power to live in prison for so many years and inspiration from the revered Bapu
Mandela said, "Mahamma is an integral part of our history because here he used himself first on the path of truth.
There is a detailed discussion on the steps needed to further strengthen the security of the country and the country.
In this conference, I have announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for national unity and this award will be given to those who have contributed somehow to national unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the country.
He worked for the entire life to curb Indias integrity.
According to him, the unity of the country is inherent in diversity of the country.
I would like to pay my tributes to Sardar Patel through this award of unity to showcase this idea.
My dear countrymen, on 13th January, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh will be celebrated.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patan.
He left his last breath in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi Patna, Programme, North India and the last time of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India received his blessings.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, the biggest service is to overcome the sufferings of the people.
This glorious glory was full of bravery, valour, sacrifice and celibacy.
His unusual knowledge was in arms and science.
On the one hand, he was one Tirandaj, on the other, Gurumukhi, Brazil, Sanskrit, Farsi, Hindi, Urdu etc.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
My dear countrymen, there have been some good incidents in the country which are not discussed in detail.
Several events are being organised across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Encourages to create a safe and healthy diet.
As part of the 'Eat Right India' campaign, Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organized across the country.
The expedition will run from 27th January.
When India is clean and healthy, India will be prosperous.
First of all, nutritious diet is needed for good health.
Be it personal life or national life or social life, the source of innovation progress.
Come, let us move ahead with innovative inspiration, innovation, innovative resolve, innovative goals and innovative altitudes.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
The 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat was completed today.
It is called Golden Jubilee Episode.
This 50th edition of the letters and phones that have been received this time.
Manika Jain, West Bengal Government, Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur, and Manika Jain of Delhi in the NDMA App have also sent similar questions through the MyGov App.
This question is very natural.
In today's era, when people almost forgot radio, why did Modi bring back the radio
Now the shopkeeper said, listen to the radio.
I heard the radio, there's talk of breaking the bomb.
The stakeholder said that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had heard that the burst of the bomb, the historical importance of the nuclear bomb tests, the radio on that day.
I was wondering at the sight of the shopkeeper gentleman's happiness, dance, this area, the snow-laden hilly area, the shopkeeper is listening to the radio throughout the day.
I am thinking of radio communication research and its far-reaching impact.
After this, when I am the Prime Minister, it is natural to take help from the most powerful connectivity.
Since May 2014, when I started taking charge of the Chief Sevak, I felt that unity of our country, our pride, history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity, mankind, mankind, emotion, sacrifice and penance should be spread to all the people of the country.
Every month, millions of letters have to be read, listening to the phone calls, knowing about the different types of apps and simultaneously, I have reached the 50th episode to talk about my own kind of fun.
The results of that survey are very encouraging.
It has been learned from the survey that seventy percent of those listening to Mann Ki Baat have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most people believe that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced economic thinking among the people of the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, there has been a lot of detailed public movement.
There has been a lot of discussion on the Haas Tag India Position.
This is such a great change that people are coming forward for social service.
Modi will come and go but our country will be sustainable and our culture will remain intact.
These small towns of 130 crore Indians will always survive.
The new inspiration filled with enthusiasm will bring the country to a higher summit.
I read letters and feel such a feeling in them and work in mind.
I have achieved both the things myself and share with them and share with you all.
But who knows when these things go home.
Sometimes there will be so much power of any government that the schemes like Selfie with Daughter with the daughter of Neeraj will start from a small village in Haryana, not only in the entire country but in the entire world.
Every section of the society, including the celebrity, has been associated with this thing and the thinking of the society has been taken up in a modern dictatorship so that the modern generation is lighted.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat has also been enjoyed but in my mind, 130 crore people are always sitting.
They're my mind.
Mann Ki Baat, but not the government, it is a matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life, including politics.
If politics becomes the main thing, it cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political incidents or political people become so important that other talents or other talents of society are neglected.
We all have the collective responsibility to keep in mind the talent of the people and other things of the society for the bright future of the country like India.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking the Prime Minister, as if you are asking a close friend of yours.
There's also a toll free number-1x7800, calling up there, people record their message in their throats.
I am trying to read letters and comments as far as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I heard too many calls.
This time, as much as the episode of Mann Ki Baat starts coming forward, I keep on reading your thoughts and deliberations while traveling at different places.
That letter is not just a paper piece for me.
Besides, I have lived almost 40-45 years of unilateral life and I have visited most of the districts of the country and have spent a lot of time in every district of the country.
And that is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself with that place.
After this, I note some information, such as the name of the village, the name of the person - such information.
In fact, in Mann Ki Baat, voice is myself, but for example, my countrymen, I would like to thank all those who contribute to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whose names I have not been able to take Mann Ki Baat till date, but they are not desperate to send their letters and comments.
I am confident that your message will come to me many times more than ever before and make the Mann Ki Baat more enthusiastic, effective and useful.
It is also tried that the letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat program should also be taken into account by the concerned departments regarding all the letters and suggestions.
I would like to thank all my friends from all walks of life, television, other TV channels and social media.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching the highest number of people in their hard work.
Thus, they became Narendra Modi for thirty minutes.
I congratulate them for their talent and skills, thank you.
I urge you all to listen to this event in my regional language.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the media friends who are constantly promoting the Mann Ki Baat programme on their channels.
No political person is satisfying the media, thinks he is covered very little or a negative coverage, but the media has taken a number of issues published in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Without your help, this journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
Generally, I say I have no mystery.
What I'm doing is perhaps in all families.
In a simple language, I try to make myself like those youngsters, keeping myself in that situation, keeping myself balanced with their intentions, I try to make a length match.
We have some old bags in our lives, if they are not brought forward then it becomes easier to understand someone.
I don't understand any of the two. Sometimes one has confessed to other than his thoughts - and has done it.
The best quality of the youngsters is that they don't believe what they do, and when they believe in something they leave behind.
Often people talk about the communication gap between the elders of the family and the Teenagers.
But most of the families are discussing limited issues with the Teenagers.
Often there is talk of studying or habits, lifestyle. Do not do this.
It is also a matter of concern that the conversations are slowly decreasing in the family without making any effort.
If we take revenge for expectation and don't discuss badly, any media is very important.
I am interacting with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I've always learned from the thoughts and thoughts of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
The youngsters are innovative, innovative and strange.
Someone says that young students want to do different kinds of work together.
I say, what's wrong with it
They're guys in Multi-Tasking, so they do it.
If we look around, we will see the social initiatives, start-ups, sports, or any other sector, the society brings big changes.
The youngsters who have shown the courage to question and dream.
If we can give up the ability to take decisions on the youngsters and if they can openly express their thoughts then they can bring about a constructive change in the country and they are doing this.
My dear countrymen, Binita Ji has written on the website of Mai Ghav from Gurugram that this time we need to say something about the Constitution Day of November 26.
This is a special day because we are entering the seventeenth year of the Constitution of India.
Binita ji, thank you very much for this advice
Yes, tomorrow's Constitution Day.
Those who have created our Constitution, let them remember those great personalities.
Our Constitution was passed on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years to 11 months and 17 days to complete this historic work for the constitution of the Constitution.
Imagine that within three years this great talented person has gifted us such a comprehensive and extensive Constitution.
The unusual pace in which they have constructed the Constitution is a unique example of Time Management and Productivity.
Inspired by this, we are also excited to finish our responsibility records.
The Constituent Assembly was a gathering of the great talented people of the country, which was supposed to provide a Constitution to every country to empower the people of India and to support the poorest of the people.
The basic features of our Constitution are the detailed description of rights and duties.
The people of the country will move ahead with the balance of these two things.
If we respect each other's rights, you will also be safeguarded your rights and if we fulfill our commitment to the Constitution then our right to save our rights will also be fulfilled.
I remember that in the year 2010, in Gujarat, in 60 years of the democracy of India, we had taken a pledge by putting a Constitution on the back of the elephant.
It was a memorable effort to make the youth aware about the constitution and to encourage them to create a variety of constitutional streams.
We are going to complete 70 years as a democratic country in 2020 and 75 years of our freedom will be completed in 2022.
Come, let us all respect the value of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress, progress and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
On 6th December, his Republic Day.
On behalf of all the nations, I salute Babasaheb who has given the right to save crores of Indians in respect of respect.
The Republic was under the concern of Babasaheb and he said that Indias democratic ideals are not external.
The definition of democracy or parliamentary system was not new for India.
In the Constitution meeting, he expressed his passion that we have achieved this freedom after a lot of war and that is why we have to save it with the last drop of blood.
He added that however, the Indians have grown in different environments, the idea of the welfare of the country is always a priority.
I once again pay my respects to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago on November 23, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev always wished the welfare of the people.
He has always shown the path of truth, work, service, compassion and compassion to society.
Our country will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in the next year, and the country will spread and spread all over the world.
All the States and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate this day with humiliation.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be inaugurated across the world.
Along with this, a train will also be run in all the sacred places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
Recently, when I was discussing this thing, I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwar.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, the Gurudwara was severely damaged, but the way the state government revived the Gurudwara with local people.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that our travellers can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th edition, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat. I believe that I had the thoughts about the Mann Ki Baat programme for the first time because you wanted to know it.
Our journey will continue.
The more I get your support, the more this journey will be deeper and more satisfactory.
Sometimes the question arises in the minds of the people, what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I want to say that one thing has touched my heart in the feedback of Mann Ki Baat, most people say that when they listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme, they feel like the family workers are sharing their words with them.
I am glad that when I am surprised to know that I am one of you, one of you, one of you and you have made me bigger, I am happy to meet you again and again as a member of your family, Mann Ki Baat.
Your good wishes, my good wishes.
Come on, let us take this journey further.
Mann Ki Baat, October, 2018
My wish, you all must participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
About six and a half months before Independence, the pictures of Sardar Patel were published in the commemoration of the famous International Magazine Time magazine on 27 January 1947.
TIM served a design of India in his lead stories.
There were more than 550 native states.
Though the British interest in India had flourished, they wanted to dissolve this country.
The Time magazine wrote that the threats like separatism, violence, food and markets, value addition and empowerment are covered by India, but if anyone has the power to build the country in line with unity then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Gandhiji told Sardar Patel that the problems of the states are so serious that you can solve it.
Sardar Patel really solved the problems one by one, and made it impossible for the entire country to be embraced by unity.
He linked all the native states to India, whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Trivankur or the native states of Rajasthan. Sardar Patel was the only person whose intellectual consideration and strategy today we can see Akhand Bharat.
This country, which is bound by unity, reminds us of the recognition of our Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel is even more important because today we will take the Statue of Unity to the nation as his best wishes.
The statue, situated on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
This will be the world's highest skyscraper.
Every Indian can proudly say that the world's highest statue is now in the Indian Ocean.
I am confident that this special architecture will be marked as a dear vision across the country.
This is the day when Indian soldiers descended on the ground of Kashmir and saved the valley from the inmates.
This historic event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old meeting of the great Indian soldier, Sam Maneksh.
The meeting was attended by Field Marshal Maneksh, when he was a convener.
At that time, a military campaign was launched in Kashmir in 1947.
Field Marshal Maneksh said, "Why was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel distressed at a meeting to delay the sending of troops to Kashmir. In the meeting, Sardar Patel, in his habitat, looked at Maneksh and said that there will be no delay in the Army campaign in Kashmir and the problem will be resolved as soon as possible.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt.
I pay my respects to Indiraji.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc. are very important in the field of sports.
These qualities are the measurements of the achievements of any player.
On the other hand, these four times are important in the formation of the nation.
These qualities among the youngsters of any country will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country but will also hoist the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I met two, which is memorable.
First, I got the opportunity to meet Para Athletes participating in the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
In this game, India has created a new record for 72 medals and has enhanced the country's respect.
We have won three more medals in the Mix Eventa in addition to 13-7 medals.
You must have remembered that this time the Asian Games were also very good to showcase India.
See, in the last few minutes, I have used the best, most beautiful words so far.
At the age of eight, he has his sex.
He spent the next eight years in an analysis.
He used to clean the DTC buses and work as a waiter at the edge of the roadside to drive livestock after leaving the unarmed labor.
These narayans have won gold medals for India in the International event today.
Not only this, in India, the sports sector is spreading in such a way that Judo-like events, where India has not yet achieved any Olympics Medal in Junior or Senior Level, the Tabavi Devi has created a renewed history in Judo in Youth Olympics.
Sixteen-year-old young woman Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
His father sells a date and a mother's fish.
Many times there was a situation that they didn't even want to buy food.
This kind of situation has also recognised the inspiration of Tawabi Devi.
He has created history of winning medals for the country.
There are many more such poems, the source of inspiration for each of them.
Every young sportsperson, his enthusiasm is introducing a New India.
My dear countrymen, you all remember, we have successfully organised FIFA UNDER 17 World CUP in 2017.
It has also been appreciated among the worlds largest tournaments.
FIFAUNDER 17 WORLD CUPRECERD has broken the number of audience.
More than 12 lakh visitors have seen football in different stadiums of the country and have encouraged young players.
This time India has achieved the privilege of World Cup Hockey Organisation in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Cup will run from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who loves the game, has a different place for Hawki.
There is a golden history of India in Hockey.
In the past, India has won gold several times and has won the World Cup.
India has also gifted some world-class players in hockey sports.
If there is a discussion with Hockey at any place in the world then it is incomplete.
Hawki magician Major Meditation is known all over the world.
Besides this, Balbinder Singh Cineyer, Lesli Claudias, Mohammed Saheed, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai Hockey has brightened Indias name in the world.
Even today, the hockey players of Team India are making a mark of success for a new generation in hard work and devotion.
Sportspersons have a wonderful experience sitting in the stadium.
While visiting Bhubaneswar, the Indian team will encourage not only all the countries.
There is a rich heritage of riches and cultural excellence and the people of Odisha must remember the inspirational character and character.
Orissa is a beautiful opportunity for sports lovers.
My best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, many people are coming forward in the work of social service, they are doing volunteering, it is becoming a great inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has also agreed to learn wheelchair basketball to play a basketball in Wheelchair.
This mentality is that self-sufficiency is the mission mode executive.
There is no Indian who will not be proud of listening to this.
I am not ours, this idea will inspire us all.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was looking at your proposals about Mann Ki Baat, I get an exciting opportunity to see a very thrilling comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He wrote in MyGov: Please tell us about how the people of India and their traditions become the best example of unity with traditional nature.
We will recognise their heritage for the Sustainable Development and there is a need to learn something from them.
I express my gratitude to you for keeping such a thing in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a thing that I inspire our glorious past and culture to come back. Today, the entire world, especially the Western countries are discussing environment conservation and looking for innovative ways for balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far away from this problem, but we have to make ourselves self-reliant to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and gods.
The Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Bat and Arjun.
In the desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the path of environment conservation.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives for the protection of trees, but they are not ready to accept the loss of a tree.
The Mishmis of Arunachal demand their relationship with the tiger.
They call him their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the tiger is seen as the protector of the forest.
The people of the Verly Community of Maharashtra are the guests of the tigers and they are the symbols of the prosperity of the tiger.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that their own fate is associated with the tiger and if the tiger does not get the food then the villagers will have to remain intact.
The Gonda tribe of Middle India stops fishing at some places in the Ken River in the breeding season.
These places are known as fish shelters, and they get fresh fish in large quantities.
The tribal community creates their homes from the natural material, which is strengthened as well as environment-friendly.
In south India, there is a small migratory community in the reflected areas of the Nilgiri Mountain, which is based on traditions, their settlements are made from local level items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in being very peaceful and inclusive, but when someone harms their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that among our first freedom fighters, the tribal community was also there.
Who can forget Lord Veersa Munda who fought hard against British rule to defend their jungles.
There are many such examples of tribal communities that can be saved from the harmony of nature that teach us and our country is lending to the tribal community for the forest wealth that is around us.
Come on, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, on Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those people and those who are doing some good work for the society.
All those things that seem to be common but in reality it has far-reaching impact on our mentality and determining the goals of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Punjab's Gurubachan Singh ji.
An ordinary and hardworking farmer was Gurubachan Singh ji's son.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh ji had told his parents that they would do this marriage in abnormal manner.
Then he suddenly said, he has a term.
Nowadays, in the wedding, it is normal that he is going to talk about a big paan, asking for something that will cause the family to fall into trouble.
But you might be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a simple white-sized farmer, he told Kannar Baba that the sacrifice that I am talking about is the real strength of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, "You should talk to me, don't wear the remnants that you have spent on the field of farming from now on.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden.
Gurubachan Singh ji feels very exciting, but this expresses his personality, and we have seen that there are many families in our society who have changed personalities into good work in the society.
Shri Gurubachan Singh ji's family established such a vision.
I've read another village in Punjab, Kallar, Majra, which is near Nawar.
Kallar Majra was headed because the people there did not burn the mud of paddy and mix it with the soil, therefore the technology required to be created by themselves.
Brother Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and those places who are making their best efforts to free the environment from pollution.
You all are taking the right path to the healthy lifestyle found in the Indian heritage.
Just like the drops of water produce the sea, such small awareness and encouraging work always helps in creating a positive environment.
There is a special significance for India this year on 11th November, because the First World War ended a hundred years ago on 11th November.
That would be a hundred years after that terrible destruction and the end of the monarchy.
The first World War I was an important event for India.
Truely, we had no connection with this war.
In spite of this, the soldiers of our country fought with Bahaduri in this war, played a big role and sacrificed the highest.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anyone in the battlefield.
Our soldiers have shown their valour in a difficult situation in the remote areas.
The only purpose of this was the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the whole world looked at the destruction.
It is estimated that about one crore soldiers and so many civilians lost their lives.
After this terrible war, the whole world understood the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
My dear countrymen, there is a speciality in the North-East of this country.
The natural beauty here is incomplete and the people here are also very talented.
Our North-East is now known for the best and great work.
This is a place where biodiversity has improved a lot.
Just a few days ago, the prestigious Future Policy has won the World Award for promoting the long-term food processing system.
The award is given by the FAORTHERATION FOD and Agricultural Organisation.
You will be happy to know that the award given for making the best policy in this particular sector is similar to Oscar.
Not only this, our Sikkim has won the award by losing all the nominations in the country.
I thank the people of Sikkim for that.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is going to end.
The weather changes are understanding.
With the climate change, the climate of the festivals has also come and can say Dhanteras, Deepawali, Vaifonta, Chhat Puja, the month of November.
I extend my best wishes to each country for all the festivals.
I exhort you to take care of yourself during the festival, look at your health and look at the good of the society.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The country will move as much as you move ahead.
