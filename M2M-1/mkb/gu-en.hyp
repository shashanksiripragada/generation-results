Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, today is the sacred pride of Diwali.
Best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
The Sloka says: The light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which shows sadness by destroying the opposite intellect.
And to recall my gratitude to Divya Jyoti, it may be better thought that we spread light, spread positiveness and pray to destroy the spirit of enmity.
Today, Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that it does not only include the Indian community, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organisations of the country also celebrate Diwali with full fervour.
In a way, India grows up there.
Friends, Festival Tourism in the world also has its own attraction.
Festival tourism is also immense potential in the festivals of our country.
It should be our endeavor to showcase such festivals, be it Holi, be it Diwali or Om, be it Pongal or Behu, and to include other states and people of other countries in the happiness of festivals.
We have many different festivals of each state in every field that people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians outside the country is also very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in Gy Mann Ki Baat that this Deepawali will do something different.
I said, Come, let us share this Deepawali glorify India's women power and achievements, that is, India's Lakshmi.
And thereafter, there was a lot of inspirational stories on social media.
He has written on the Namo App that my mother is my power.
Since my father was slaughtered in the 10th century, my mother had taken up the responsibility of our five daughters.
Today, we are in a good profession of five brothers.
My mother is God for me.
It is an integral part for me and that is the real sense of India's Lakshmi.
Ramesh ji, my best wishes to your mother.
Deepika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for her, Major Anandbu Kanwar is the Lakshmi of India, who is just the daughter of the conductor.
For poet Tirvari, India's Lakshmi is his daughter.
He is proud that his daughter works beautifully.
He has achieved a very good record in the examination of CLAT.
Medha Jain ji has also written that a two-year-old woman has been providing free water to travellers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Medhaji has been very inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
So many stories have been shared by people.
If you must read, get inspiration and even yourself have any such inspirational story around you, then share it.
My best wishes to all these Lakshmis of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 12th century.
In this poem of Kannada, how beautiful words, how good feelings and how good thoughts are there.
PANINDA PERMEGONDA PEMEGONU HIMVANTU, PANINDA BHIGU PERCHIDANUPANDA PERCHIDANUPANDA JASWADENU ARTHATH, HIMVANT i. e.
Our daughters are our pride and with the greatness of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, 12th November, 2019 is the day that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Jis 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated across the globe.
Guru Nanak ji's influence is not only in India but in the whole world.
In some countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget my visit to Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can tell you, but for this there is a lot of need for Mann Ki Baat.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji delivered his message to the remotest of the world.
He was one of the most travellers in his time.
And wherever they went, they enjoyed their simplicity, humility and simplicity.
By conveying the message of equality and equality, whether it is north or south, east or west, everywhere, people have received saints and sages.
It is believed that the well-known saint of Assam Shankar Dev was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
A sacred place in Kashi is Gurubagh Gurudwara .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji was there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev ji visited Sri Lanka in the south.
During the visit of Bidar to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji himself brought the problem of water there.
There is a famous place of Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar which reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
During a sad demise, Guru Nanak Dev ji also visited Kashmir in the north and its surrounding areas.
This led to a closer ties between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Tibet where people had considered him a guru.
He is also devoted to Uzbekistan where he had visited.
He was addressing the hearts of millions of people who followed his teachings with full faith and are doing it even today.
Just a few days back, the ambassadors of about 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
He visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this was done on the occasion of the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Thereafter, many princes had put forward their discussions on the social media and also describe their best experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that you all will remember the 31st of October.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India who served the country in the list of unity.
In Sardar Patel, where there was a wonderful capacity to connect people together, on the other hand, those who had ideological differences also shared their ties with them.
He was a man of details in the true sense.
At the same time, he was also innocent in the organization skills.
He was involved in formulating and devising schemes.
Whenever we read about Sardar Saheb's work style, we can hear how important his organisation was.
Thousands of representatives from across the country were required to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 121.
The entire system of the session was responsible for Sardar Patel. He also used this opportunity to improve the network of water supply in the city.
And I ensured that no one has any water problem.
Not only that, he was also aware of the fact that no representative's goods or footprints would be broken at the Convention place and you would be very surprised to know that the work done by Sardar Patel.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make khadi bags.
On the other hand, the sale of fertilizer has also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel has done a very big work and historical work to unite the holidays.
Sardar Vallabhbhai was also a special feature whose eyes were on every incident.
On one hand, he was focused on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his focus was on Dursudur Lakshadweep.
When we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in the unity of some particular states is also discussed.
Immediately after the partition of India in 14th, our neighbour's eyes were on Lakshadweep and he had sent a ship with his flag.
Like Sardar Patel, it was known that he immediately started hard work without delay, without delaying time.
After his instance, the Tricolor was rushed and destroyed every aspect of the neighborhood to capture the Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel said that he personally ensures that necessary help is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the progress of India.
This is also an attractive tourist place .
I hope you all will visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, the day of 31st October, 2018 that the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world in memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the world's highest statue.
The Statue of Liberty located in the US is also more than double the height.
The world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride.
Every Indian's head gloriously rises.
You will be happy to know that more than 26 lakh tourists had visited the Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that every day around 8,500 people visited the grandeur of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, for the country, for the tourism industry of all the states, this Statue of Unity can be a matter of study.
We all are witnesses to how a place develops as a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There people from all over the country come.
Transport, living, guides and environment friendly arrangements are developing in itself.
A large economy is developing and people are providing facilities according to the needs of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, There will be no such Hindustan who will not be proud of the fact that the Time Magazine has also given an important place to the Statue of Unity in the 100 important tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that you all will also go to see the Statue of Unity from your precious times.
This is my intention.
Friends, you know that National Integration Day is celebrated every year from 31st October, 2014.
On this day, we instruct us to protect our countrys unity, integrity and security from anyhow.
Like every time, Ekta Run for Unity is also being organised on October 31.
It will include every section of the society, every section of the society.
Nowadays, people are getting a grief and genocide for merathon.
Run for Unity has also been a unique experience.
Running is beneficial for all of these minds, minds and body.
The feelings of fit India are realized by running here.
And along with this, we are also associated with the goal of a India-Sreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body, the mind and culture are connected to bring India to a new height for the unity of India.
And therefore, whatever city you live in, you can connect yourselves with the importance of running for unity around you.
I hope you all will run on 31st October, for the unity of India and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country with unity.
This mantra of unity has become like a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage at every stage at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and mutual understanding of the country.
If we look around us, there will be many examples that have been working continuously to enhance mutual understanding.
But many times it happens that the efforts of the society are lost very soon from the memorial.
Friends, I remember that in September 2019, Allahabad High Court had heard of its deeds on Ramjanmabhoomi.
Just remember those days when there was a situation.
How the groups of self-helps were playing games to take advantage of this situation in their own way.
What kind of language was spoken to create heat in the atmosphere.
In different voices, efforts were also being made to fill the throne.
Efforts were made to reduce turmoil from the environment.
We should always remember that it gives us great strength.
That day, that moment is an obligation for all of us.
This is an example of the sound of unity that can give strength to the country.
Today, I also pay my tributes to them.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have listened to these things, so I think I have listened to you too.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield or the temperature goes from zero to 50-60 degrees minus.
Oxygen is also called only in the air.
It is not less than any parallel to such challenges in the opposite context.
In such a disadvantaged struggle, we are protecting the borders of the country by taking out the chest of our martyrs, but they are also running a clean Siachen campaign.
I congratulate the countrymen for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to crush Kasay too.
In such a situation, it is a very important task to separate the waste and manage it.
We all know that Siachen is a snow laden region that is the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, walking the cleanliness drive means to ensure clean water for the people living in the disadvantaged areas and also use rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a celebration of a new consciousness in the lives of all of us.
And especially in Deepawali, buying something or the other, bringing something from the market, every family has to become a small quantity.
I once said that we want to buy only the local items.
If we get the requirements from our villages then we do not need to go to the tehsils.
If you meet in Taluka then you do not need to go to Gilla.
We will try to buy more local goods.
Gandhi will become a great opportunity in itself for half a century.
And I am insisting that we should buy something or the other thing made by the workers of our Khadi built by our dear brothers and sisters.
This Deepawali had also purchased a lot before Diwali.
But there will be a lot of people who will think that if I go after Diwali then perhaps even a little cheaper will be available.
There will be many people whose purchases are still remaining.
So, with the wishes of Deepawali, I would like to invite you to buy local goods and buy local things.
You see, how important we can play in fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again, I congratulate you on the auspicious occasion of this Deepawali.
In Deepawali, we burst a variety of pieces.
But sometimes there is an injury in carelessness.
Sometimes there are injuries too.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and also to celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Fortunately there will be any Indian who is not proud of our armed forces, our soldiers.
Every Indian, whether it is any field, caste, religion, religion or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians had celebrated Parikram Parv.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016 when our soldiers responded to the philosophers of Proxy War under the guise of treason on our nation.
Our armed forces have organized exhibitions at different places in the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the young generation, can know what our strength is, how capable and how our soldiers protect our country by risking their lives.
Like the Parakram Parva, the day reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our armed forces.
And inspire us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. It has now been decided that our soldiers will respond to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We believe in peace and are committed to encouraging it, but with respect, it is not at all at the cost of the nation's sovereignty.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
In the 20th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their supreme sacrifice for peace when we had no connection with the war.
Our eyes were never on any other land.
It was our commitment to peace.
Just a few days back, on 23rd September, we remembered our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancers who had liberated Haifa from the invaders.
It was also an undertaking made by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Today, India is one of the largest soldiers in the various peacekeeping armies of the United Nations.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets for decades.
During the Republic Day celebrations, people are one of the greatest interests of the Parade, the Fly Past in which our Air Force exhibits its power with unprecedented carnivals.
On 8th October, we celebrate the Air Force Day.
Our Air Force has joined the 21st Century's most brave and powerful Air Force today to move ahead with a small beginning with 6 Pilots and 1 Air Force in 132.
I convey my best wishes to all Air Warriors and their families for their service to the nation.
In 14th century, when Pakistan's attackers launched an unprecedented attack, the Air Force was the one who ensured that Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield to save Srinagar from the attacks.
The Air Force also responded to the enemies in 165.
Who does not know the war of independence of Bangladesh in 11th
Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from the occupation of arsons.
In Tiger Hill, the air force smoked them by bombing night and night at places of enemies.
Whether it is relief and rescue work or disaster management, the country is gratitude to our air warriors for their commendable work.
Their morale has been amazing to face the natural calamities and to help the countrymen from storms, windows, floods to forests.
Air Force has established examples in ensuring the equality of gender equity in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments for the country's labourers.
Now, the Air Force is also giving the women an alternative to the Parmant Commission along with the Short Service Commission, which I had announced on the Red Fort on August 15 this year.
India can proudly say that in the armed forces of India, not only men but women power is also becoming equally contributor.
The women are empowered, but now they are becoming empowered.
My dear countrymen, Abhilash Tommy, an officer of the Navy, was fighting for his life and death.
The whole country was worried about how to save tomatoes.
You know that Abhilash Tommy is a very adventurous officer.
He was the first Indian to visit the world by taking a small boat without any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, he was moving forward in the sea to participate in the Golden Global race in the South Indian Ocean, but made the horrific sea storms difficult for him, but the brave soldiers of India continued to live between the sea for several days.
I had already met Tommy.
Even after coming out of such a crisis, he had a strong morale and once again the determination to do something like this is inspiring for the young generation of the country.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and will inspire the younger generation of our country to win their courage, their valour, their determination and determination.
My dear countrymen, every child knows what is important for our nation on 2nd October.
This year's 2nd October has a special significance.
Today, for two years, we are going to organize several programmes across the globe on the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Whether it is Martin Luther King Junior or the great wonders like Nelson Mandela, everyone got the power from Gandhiji's ideas and fought a long struggle to give their people equality and respect.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I want to discuss with you another important task of worshipping Bapu, which more and more people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle took place in 1945, he prepared a corrective copy of the ideas.
Revered Bapu has preserved his ideas on several topics such as the protection of the rights of farmers, villages, labourers, cleanliness, spreading education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Popular Bapu was a collector.
It was the speciality of Bapu to connect people with them and to link them with them.
Everyone has realized this as the most unique feature of their personality.
He made every person feel that it is the most important and sustainable thing for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
On the advent of Mahatma Gandhi, every field of society, every section of the society dedicated itself to the freedom struggle.
Bapu had given us an inspirational mantra which is often known as Gandhiji's Telisman.
In this, Gandhiji said, I give you a gentleman, whenever you are skeptical that whenever you start roaming on your own, remember the face of the poorest and weakest person you have seen and ask your heart how useful it will prove to be for the person.
Will it benefit him
Can he control anything on his own life and fate
I mean, will it help millions of people who are hungry and are unhappy with it
Then you will see that your doubts are being cured and this is being done.
My dear countrymen, a gap of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class in the country, its growing economic power, the growing purchasing power, can we recall the revered Bapu for a moment if we go to buy anything
Can you remember that gate of devotee Bapu
What will be fortunate that will benefit from your purchase directly or indirectly
And if the poor will benefit the poor, then my happiness will be higher.
Whenever we buy anything in the days to come, whenever we celebrate Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, we must think that every one of our purchases requires the wishes of some countrymen and those who have sweat, who have put their money, who have dedicated their talent, they should have some benefit.
This is Gandhis message and I am confident that the poorest and the weakest person can bring a small step in his life.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that if he cleanses, he would get freedom then he would not know how he would be, but that happened, India got freedom.
Similarly, even today, we can feel that even my small work can make my contribution in the economic progress and economic empowerment of my country, in the power to fight against poverty and I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's age.
As we think about buying manufacturing of manure and handlooms on special occasions, it will help many farmers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri ji used to keep the old or broken clothes of Khadi because somebodys hard work is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these khadi clothes are built with a lot of hard work. One of them should be used.
This feeling of affection with the country and love towards the countrymen was settled in the rage of the glorious glory.
Two days later, along with the revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji.
As soon as the name of Shastri ji comes, we feel the feeling of incomplete faith in the minds of Indians.
His magnificent personality always fills every countrymen with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji's speciality was that he was seen to be extremely humble from outside but he was determined like a mountain from inside.
Their message of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is the identity of his immense personality.
The result of his unsavorable penance towards the nation was that during his one-and-a-half-year brief tenure, he had given the mantras to the country's youth and farmers to reach the peak of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are reminding of the revered Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot live without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called Swachhata Hi Seva was launched from September 15.
Millions of people joined this campaign and I am also fortunate to pay sanitation to children at Ambedakar School, Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation stone was laid by my devotee Babasaheb.
Every section of the people from all over the country joined this labour dharna on this 15th.
Institutions also contributed to Rangechang.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSS (NSS), youth organizations, media groups, corporate world, all of whom paid sanitation at large scale.
I congratulate all these sanitation lovers for this.
Come on, let's hear a phone call
You have said that cleanliness has its own importance in everybody's lives and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, your home has become toilets and what can be more happy for us than it is now facilitating you
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign will not be able to guess that you cannot see because of being an intellectual, but if you do not have toilets then you will have to live with how many difficulties and after becoming a toilet, it became a big boon for you.
Perhaps you had not even phoned for talking about this aspect, perhaps this sensitive aspect would not have been seen in the minds of people associated with this cleanliness drive.
I especially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, 'Clean India Mission' has become a successful story not only in the country but in the whole world, all are talking about it.
This time India is organizing the worlds largest cleanliness summit in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) and experts from all over the world have come together and share their experiences and experiences related to cleanliness.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded with the launch of Bapus 150th birth anniversary on 2nd October, 2018.
It is particularly indispensable to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, the victims and the deprived.
Dr.
In the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 2013.
After a few days, NHRC is going to complete 25 years.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to enhance human dignity.
Our familiar leader, former Prime Minister of our country, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji clearly said that human rights are not a transparent concept for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, an ideal message of Vedic times is engraved.
NHRC has created widespread awareness for human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
During this 25-year visit, he has created an atmosphere of hope and trust among the people of the country.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I understand that this is a very very optimistic event.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand and bring the importance of human rights in practice.
My dear countrymen, be it the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan or the birth anniversary of Rajmata Vijayaraj Singh ji or the birth centenary year. All these great men have been inspiring us all, we bow down to Sardar Saheb and we will talk in detail on the Jayanti of Sardar Saheb on 31st October, but today I want to mention that for some years on the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb in every small town of India, every village of the country, every village of the country and every village of the country is being celebrated.
This year too, we will try to organise the Run for Unity in our villages, towns, towns and cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to build every section of society and every unit of the country in the field of unity through the run-for-Unity on 31st October and that will be a good tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the whole country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has also been a great example of social harmony.
There are several such stories in the history of the country in which one Bhakti had linked two different states or people associated with religion with faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also coming.
The entire atmosphere will emerge from the elephants, horses, palanquins.
The joy of swimming in the color of Lord Krishna is different.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen on the occasion of Sanskrit.
I am extremely grateful to the daughter Chinmayi who raised this issue.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of the dawn.
I congratulate all those who are engaged in protecting this great heritage, nurturing and bringing it to the people.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world.
And all of us are also proud of the fact that since the Vedas, Sanskrit language has played a very important role in spreading knowledge.
The collection of knowledge related to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language for interaction.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which innumerable words are possible.
There is a possibility of creation of innumerable words through 200 dhatus, 200 per capita sufficient, 22 per capita and samas.
And that is why a microscopic feeling or the subject can be expressed at all.
That is, if a guru gives knowledge of a letter to his student then there is no such thing or wealth in the entire planet that the guru can deduct that loan.
We all celebrate this teaching day. Knowledge and guru are incomparable, invaluable and invaluable.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the next day.
I thank you all for your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, it brings new hopes for our farmers who work hard.
Monsoon provides relief to trees and dry reservoirs drying in strong heat.
But sometimes it brings immense and destructive floods.
The situation of nature has emerged that some places have received more rain than other places.
Just now, we all saw that Kerala has had a great impact on the entire life.
Today, the whole country has emerged with Kerala in this difficult process.
Our compassion is with those families.
I am confident that Kerala will be resumed very soon due to the courage and courage of the people of the state.
But at the time of disasters, we also see humanity.
Be it Kerala or any other district or region of India, it is doing something or the other in place of every private sector from Kashmir to Kamrup and Kanyakumari.
People associated with all age groups and every field of work are contributing to it.
We all know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are drying up the ongoing rescue operation in Kerala.
He left no stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood.
Whether it is an air force or ship or landlord or BSF, CISF or RAF, everyone has played a very important role in rescue and relief operations.
I also want to make special mention of the hard work done by the NDRF to visit Bahadur.
The topic of which people from all over the country have written is our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Akhil Pandey from Katihar, Bihar, who knows how many people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and My Gov and urged me to talk about the different aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the 16th August, the country and the world listened to the news of Atal ji's demise.
A nation who had left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he had gone far away from active politics.
The kind of affection, respect and condolences that have emerged in the entire country for Atal ji demonstrates their great personality.
For the last several days, Atal ji's best aspect has come in front of the country.
India will always be the credit of Atal ji for the First Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation brought about two important changes in the governance of India.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
Secondly, the limits fixed under the anti-party law were increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Specific guidelines have also been set up to make the participants disqualified.
For many years, the political culture of building a large number of cabinets in India was built, not only for the partition of work but also for the enjoyment of politicians.
Atal ji changed this culture.
These steps saved money and resources.
There has also been an increase in efficiency along with it.
Atal ji was a long vision that changed the situation and brought about a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presentation from 5 PM to 11 PM in the morning.
Similarly, he brought our life-loving Tricolor closer to the people.
I would definitely say that for healthy democracy, for good democracy, for good traditions, for strengthening democracy, continuous efforts should be made to strengthen democracy, open discussions should also be given to Atal ji as a good tribute.
Just a few days back, the Monsoon Session of Parliament has been completed.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 percent and the Rajya Sabha was 4 percent.
And the result of this is that the Lok Sabha passed 21 legislative and the Rajya Sabha passed 14 legislative sessions.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and youth welfare.
Several important legislatives who benefitted the youth and the backward classes have been passed in this session.
You all know that for decades, like the Scheduled Tribes, the other Backward Classes-OBC Panchayats were being demanded.
To ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has decided to form an OBC Commission this time.
The session also envisages passing amendments to protect the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Acts.
The Act will provide better protection to the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Together, it will prevent the offenders from atrocities against the people of this class and synthesis faith in the Dalit community.
No member can afford any injustice against the women power of the country.
Therefore, the Parliament has crossed the Excessive Judicial Amendment Legislature and has triggered strict punishment for such crimes and the culprits of misdeeds will be punished for at least 10 years.
However, those who sacrificed children below 12 years of age will be punished with famine.
Just a few days ago, it has been read in the printing press that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has completed the hearing in just two months and has punished two crimes of fascism on one side.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had punished the culprits after just five days of swearing.
Even in Rajasthan, the awardees have made such a fast payment.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing crime cases against women and children.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
This time, in the fourth session, everyone has presented an ideal together.
Today I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, today the focus of crores of people is on Asian sports being played in Jakarta.
Every day in the morning, people first look at the news, news, social media and see that any Indian player has won the lunar.
Asian sports is still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who have won the Silver for the country.
I extend my best wishes to the sportspersons whose competitions are still pending.
Indias sportspersons are particularly showing excellence in sportspersonship, but our sportspersons are also bringing sportspersons in such sports that our sight is not so good before, like Wushu and boating.
This is not just a luminar, but a myth of the Indian sportspersons and the sky of the sportspersons, Jussa and dreams.
Our daughters are involved in the growing number of medal winners for the country, which is a very positive signal.
Similarly, among the young sportspersons who are sportspersons, we are also young people in the age group of 15-16 years.
This is also a very good sign that most of the sportspersons who have won the medals are living in small towns and villages and these sportspersons have achieved this success through hard work.
On this occasion, I congratulate all the sportspersons and pay my tributes to Hockey's magical player Shri Dhyanchand Ji.
I urge all citizens of the country to play sports and take care of their fitness because healthy India will create a prosperous and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then only a bright future of India will be created.
Namaste Bhavnaji, I respect your feelings.
But can you imagine that nearly 1200 years ago a large mountain which was a whole rock was given the form of a magnificent and magnificent temple.
And that temple is the Kailashnath Temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra. If anyone tells you that a 60 metre long pillar of granite was built about a thousand years ago and a stone stone of about 80 tons of granite was laid on its top.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable meeting of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patna, Gujarat.
India's Bhumi Engineering Laboratory.
There were several engineers in India who made Alpunya a pledge and presented examples of miracles in the engineering world.
We also got a letter in our heritage of great engineers whose work has been done by people even today.
M.
But the rest of the country also remembers them with great respect and intimacy.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following their footsteps, engineers of our country have made their own identity in the whole world.
Just as I talk about miracles in the engineering world, I remember a serious earthquake that had emerged in Gujarat in 2001.
So I got the opportunity to go to a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age.
They were joking at me and saying that this is my house.
This is called Bhungo in Kutch.
I have seen 3-3 earthquakes in my house.
But you will not be able to see any damage.
This house was built by our ancestors according to the natural conditions and environment here.
And he was proud of the fact that I was thinking that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created a local situation, due to which the common man was safe.
Now that we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think about the future.
Workshops should be done at different places.
In the changing era we have to learn something new
Will you have to learn
Will you have to join
What should be taught to the students
How to make ero West our priority
We must think of many such things when we celebrate Engineers Day.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
And along with this, preparations for Diwali are also started.
Best wishes to all with such a spirit.
Thank you, I'll meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So, in some places people are still waiting for rain.
The vastness and diversity of India sometimes shows the form of rains as well.
But what do we blame the rain
It is human beings who have chosen the path of conflict with nature and consequently, sometimes nature is angry with us.
It takes usually a few hours to go inside the cave and get out of it .
But on that day, Kishmat was a little more deserving.
When he went a good distance inside the cave, due to heavy rains, such water was collected near the entrance of the cave.
The way to get out of them was closed.
Because they didn't find any way, they stopped at a small hill inside the cave.
And that is not one or two days, for the last 18 days.
On one hand, he was confronting the crisis.
On the other hand, on the other hand, humanity in the entire world was demonstrating the remaining human characteristics of God.
People from all over the world were praying to get these children out of peace.
The experience of responsibility at all levels was amazing.
Whether it is the government or the parents of these children, their family members, the medium of broadcasting or the citizens of the country, everyone has shown a magnificent conduct of peace and courage.
Everyone was associated with their campaign by becoming a team.
I believe that the systematic behavior of everybody is a subject of learning, it is like understanding.
It is not that parents are not sad, it is not that tears are not brought out from the eyes of mothers, but it is like learning for us ourselves.
It shows that as humanity is a wealth, marvellous things are created.
A few days ago, the poet Neeraj ji, the beloved poet of our country, had made a farewell from us.
We can give a lot of strength to the Indians as well.
The Board of our Schools spoke of the stress and calibration of our examinations, which is now a message for students like me.
However, the two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and all the youngsters.
Because this is the time when the college has a very busy time.
Millions of young people like Satyam come out of school and enter the college.
If we go to the examinations, papers and norths of February and March, we can enjoy the holidays of April and May as well as the results are spent in determining the path ahead in life, selecting a worker.
The attention of the students is limited to the school.
Students come under the umbrella of professionals from parents' umbrellas.
I am confident that my young friends will be very excited and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, going out of the house, leaving the village, getting out of a safe environment, you have to become your partner.
All such youngsters have to leave their homes for the first time and leave their lives in a new direction.
I would like to tell you all that, keep yourself calm, accept yourselves and enjoy yourselves in your life.
Teach some new languages like new skills and new languages.
He has already succeeded in the MBBS examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father is nurturing his family.
I congratulate him for his success.
There are many students who come from the poor families and despite the opposite constraints, they have done something that inspires us all from their hard work and perspective.
Be it the Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied himself sitting under a streetlight on footpath, the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afreen Sheikh or his father, who runs autorickshaw.
Otherwise, the disabled daughter of Gurgaon, Anushka Panda, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called spine muscular atrophy since birth.
All of them have achieved such success in the whole world by breaking every obstacle with their determination and commitment.
If we look around us, we will also find some such examples.
Any good incident in any corner of the country gives me energy and inspires me.
And as I tell you the story of these youngsters, I remember the words of poet Neeraj ji and this is the goal of life.
There was something like this, once I was discussing with two Indian youths in San Jose city of America, known as technology hub.
I appealed to them how they can use their talent for India, think and take time.
He called for the transformation of the brain drive into brain gene.
Both of them of Rae Bareli made an innovative attempt by IT professionals Yogesh Sahuji and Raniesh Bajpai ji to shout at my challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have made a smart village app together using their professional skills.
This app is not just linking the people of the village to the entire world but now they can get any information on their mobile phones.
These residents of Taudhakpur village of Rae Bareli, Sarpanch of the village, District Magistrate, Technical Development Officer, all of them made people aware of the use of this app.
It has become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development work done in the villages.
The App consists of village phone deractories, news departments, relevant relevant relevant relevant, health centres and recognition centres.
Grammar Feature of App, Factory Rate between the farmers, works like a market for their products in a way.
If you look at this incident in detail then one thing will be taken into consideration that those who have lost their lives in the United States of America, those who have left India many years ago, those youngsters who know the nuances of their villages, those who understand challenges and are associated with the implementation of the village.
Because of this reason, perhaps they could make the village better, they could make it something better.
There is a natural feeling of showing something to your village, to your roots and to our roots.
But sometimes because of a distance, sometimes a thin dust accumulates on it, but if a small trauma touches them, then good things emerge again.
Pundarpur Wari is a unique journey in itself .
Friends, Ashwadhi Akadeshi, who was celebrating 23 this time, is celebrated as a grand festival of Pandharpur Bari.
Pundarpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15-20 days before Ashwadi Academy, the pilgrims from Barkri i. e.
This journey, which is called Bari, is linked to millions of workers.
The meeting was held by the legends of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram in Palakhi.
Lord Vithal, who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the underprivileged.
There is a lot of devotion to people from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
There is a different experience of visiting Vithioba Temple in Pandharpur and its glory, its beauty and spiritual joy.
I would like to appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat that once you get the opportunity, you must experience Pandharpur.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still teaching people in Maharashtra.
They are empowering them to fight against blindness.
Whether it is their weight or indifferent, we receive the message of equality, love and brotherhood from them.
There is a mantra to fight the society against the blindness.
These were those who stopped the society from time to time, showed tokyo and girdles and ensured that the old princes are deprived of our society and the culture of compassion, equality and compassion amongst the people, our land is a huge desert.
On 23rd July, we recall Tilak jis birth anniversary and his death anniversary on the first August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence.
The British rulers had the power to showcase their mistakes and the intelligence.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he intended to impose a sedition on him three times in 20 years and it was not a small thing.
Today, I want to place a charming event related to his statue in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in August 2016, more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad, probably 100 years ago.
During this visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had got the opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 120, he decided that he would make Tilak ji's memorial in Ahmedabad.
At the end, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not by anyone else but by the hands of Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February 12.
And I am listening to this period of the British.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji, the tradition of Ganesh Utsav was started.
The Public Ganesh Festival had become an effective medium to pursue the spirit of social awakening, community, equality and equality among the people along with traditional faith and aspirations.
As such, it was a time when the country was enriched for the war against the British, these festivals had done a job to break the words of caste and community.
The popularity of these events has increased over time.
This shows how this is the cruise of our youth towards our old heritage and our brave leaders of history.
Today, in many cities, it is like this that you can see the Mandapa of Ganesh in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had also been inspired during my visit and today as I recall Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would like to once again invite you to celebrate the Ganesha Festival, celebrate the Ganesha Festival with full strength, but keep insistence on celebrating the Eco Friendly Ganesha Festival.
And so far, I will say that the festivals of Eko Friendly Ganesha will also be held on My Goa and on Narendra Modi App for extensive publicity.
I will convey your message to the people.
Democratic Tilak made a sense of self-confidence among the people of the country and he had given the message that Swaraj is our birthplace and we will be able to take it, even today it is time to say that.
Our self-respect is our birth-sufficient authority and we will be able to take it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and development.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrasekhar inspired many youths for the bravery and freedom struggle.
Azad put his life on a boat but he never bowed himself before foreign rule.
I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to go to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute these two great personalities of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandra Shekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days back, India's brave daughter and son of Kisanputri Hima Dase won the Golden Jubilee Centre at the 400-meter race competition at the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland.
In response to my letter, I have e-mailed from Indonesia that she is now preparing Asian Games.
The country's name has been illuminated.
Unity has won gold and bronze moon in World Para Athletics Grand Pre-2018 in Tunisia.
This achievement is especially because he has made his challenges a medium of his work.
In 2003, due to road accidents, half of the below the body of daughter Ekta Bhaiyan has become inadequate, but this daughter has not lost her courage and has achieved this achievement.
One more Divisional Yogash Kathunia Ji has also established a worldwide Golden Centre in Pera Athletics Grand Prince (Cyclephant) in Berlin, and along with Sunder Singh Gurjar has also won the Golden Centre in Bhalafank.
My dear countrymen, many incidents and festivals of the history of the month of August, but sometimes the disease also enters the house due to the motion.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for your best health, for this August, and for many festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Once again I will definitely meet Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Just a few days back, a historic cricket match was held in Bengaluru.
You must have understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistans first international match and it is a matter of pride for Indians that this historic meeting of Afghanistan was with India.
The two teams demonstrated a very good performance in this meeting, and also showcased Rashid Khan, another speaker from Afghanistan, in the IPL this year, and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shriman Ashraf Ghani, had written a tag to me on his twitter, the people of Afghanistan are very proud of his hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have completed a platform to showcase their skills to our players.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan.
He is the world's asset of cricket and he also wrote it in a little joke or not. We will give it to anyone.
This meeting will be a memorable match for all of us.
This was the first match therefore it is very natural to remember but I will remember that match for some particular reason.
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world.
What can a winner team do while taking a trophy, he added.
While taking a trophy from the Indian team, the Afghan team, which was playing an international match for the first time, invited the Afghan team and photographed the two teams.
We can realize what is the spirit, what is the spirit and the spirit.
There is a great way to unite the sports community and to find out the talents of our youngsters.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will play with each other in the same way as well as play with the entire Sportsman spirit.
My dear countrymen, there was a different sight on this 21st June 4th Yoga Day.
The whole world looked together.
In Brussels, the European Parliament, the United Nations headquarters in New York, the fighters of Japanese Navy, people were seen doing yoga everywhere.
The historic event of Yoga was held for the first time in Saudi Arabia and I was told that women had done demonstration of several asanas.
On the higher Barfila Summits of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China simultaneously practiced Yoga.
Yoga works to break and connect all the borders.
Thousands of enthusiastic people of hundreds of countries have made this opportunity a big festival by going above every kind of discrimination, caste, religion, region, color or linga.
If people from all over the world were so excited and participated in the Yoga Day programmes then why wouldn't it be multiplied in India
The country is proud when one hundred and fifty crore people see that the security forces of our country have studied Yoga in three places of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga somewhere in Sabarimani, while some soldiers performed yoga on snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force surprised everyone by doing yoga at a height of 15 thousand feet between the sky and the Earth.
The sight was that he did not sit in the air but walked in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, tall buildings or sports grounds, Yoga has taken place everywhere.
The heart touched a sight of Ahmedabad.
About 50 Divyang brothers and sisters established the world radiation by doing yoga together at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is working as a challenge and revolution.
I hope that the movement of welfare from Yoga will move forward.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
On my Government and Narendra Modi App, many people have written to me that I will talk about the Doctors Day in Mann Ki Baat this time on 1st July.
We remember the doctor at a time of difficulty, but this is a day when the country exhibits the achievements of our doctors and thanks to them for their service and dedication to the society.
We are those people who naturally worship Mother God, believe in God, because Mother gives us life.
When the mother gives birth to us, sometimes the doctor gives us birth again.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only.
Today doctors have medical expertise and they will have a general life system and they have a lot of experience in their health.
Indian doctors have made their identity worldwide with their capability and skills.
In the medicinal profession, Maharath and hardworking are also known for encouraging our Doctors Complex Medical Problems.
Without Mann Ki Baat, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all our doctors on behalf of every countrymen on the 1st of July.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India.
India is a prosperous history when there is no such month, there is no such day in which there is no historical incident.
See, everywhere in India has its own inheritance.
There is a saint associated with it, there is a great man, there is a famous person, everyone has the contribution of his own self.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th Tariq and whenever I was in Gujarat, Kabirwad of Gujarat would have been known to you.
When I used to work there, I had done a great national convention of people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabir Das Ji had come to Maghar
At that time there was a belief that those who died in Maghar do not go to heaven.
In contrast to this, the body which sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven.
Mugahar was considered unclean but Saint Kabir Das did not believe in it.
He worked to break such evils and superstitions of his time and therefore he went to Maghar and he swept away there.
Saint Kabir Das ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his colleagues and brotherhood.
He was their ideal.
We see these ideals in their creations and they are equally inspiring in today's era.
One of his companions is Kabir Soi Pir Hai, if the people don't know Pirjas, then I am the true Pir Saint who knows and understands the sufferings of others, who don't know the sufferings of others, he is neutral.
Kabir Das ji gave special emphasis on social equality.
He used to think a long way ahead of his time.
At that time when the time of the world and the conflict was going on, he recommended peace and harmony and worked to remove the differences by uniting the people.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took several initiatives for the betterment of society.
The system of cooking free from social discrimination where people of every caste, religion or community can come and eat food and Guru Nanak Dev had started this langer system.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and zeal.
I also urge you people to think about the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, how to celebrate it in the entire society and around the world, what are new ideas, what are new ideas, what are new ideas, what are new ideas and how to make it a festival of inspiration with great pride.
The struggle for India's independence is very long, very wide, very expansive and is full of innumerable martyrs.
There is a myth associated with Punjab.
In 2001, the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh is also going to be completed for 100 years, which had put humanity in ruin.
Who can forget the black day of 13th April, when the power used to cross all limits of cruelty and put pills on innocent, handicapped and innocent people.
The victory is always peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Shri Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjees birthday and he wants Dr.
I talk to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Raman ji first thank you very much.
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with several fields but the areas that were closer to him were education, administrative and parliamentary affairs.
Very few people would know that he was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University of Kolkata.
Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation at Kolkata University in Bengali on the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first entrepreneur of India and in a sense, he laid the foundation stone of India and the strong base of industrial development, had prepared a strong platform.
The first technological policy of independent India in 1948 brought a print of their ideas and vision.
Mukherjee had a dream that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handloom, clothing and cottage industries.
All India handicrafts board, All IndiaHandloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were established between 148 and 150 for the benefit of the financial and organisation sector for better development of Kutir and Small Industries.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Their understanding, wisdom and activism is the result of a part of Bengal to be saved and it is today a part of India.
Dr.
Remember the message of the unity of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, with the spirit of equality and brotherhood, remain connected to the progress of India.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video calls.
He had the opportunity to learn directly about the changes in the lives of the people going ahead of the files.
People spoke of their resolve, their happiness and sadness and their achievements.
In far-flung villages, the workers are providing services from the pension of the old people to the construction of passports through the Common Service Centre.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh combines Sitafal and makes her ice cream and does business.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of young people of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing cheap medicines to the surrounding villages.
I don't know how to talk about the fact that there will be no corner of the country where people don't have to say their success.
In such a situation, when the common man comes with the words of new hope, new aspirations and incidents that have happened in his life, it is not the credit of the government.
Even the incident of a small child from a remote village becomes inspired by hundreds of crores of people.
With the help of technology, through video bridge, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries has been very happy and very inspiring and it gives me the satisfaction of working but also the enthusiasm to work more.
A new joy, a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration is achieved from the poor to the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge and you have done the job of giving me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then somewhere or the other is good.
There are good people.
We can also experience the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing has come to my mind and it is a unique combination.
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand, we are farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Now you will think that this is just two different businesses.
However, in Bengaluru, corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together and they have made a simple prosperity trust and they have activated this trust for the farmers to double their income.
They have been linked with the farmers and made jobs and have been making successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today they are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through the Trust.
The farmers who produce grains are also associated with it.
On the one hand, from the production of crops to marketing, the farmers have an important role in the entire chain, while on the other hand, efforts are made to ensure the participation of the farmers in profits.
I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technology and engineering have taken the path of connecting the farmers, connecting the villages and connecting them with the fields.
I once again congratulate the young generation of my country for their innovative experiments, sometimes I know something, some people will not know, some will not know, but the crores of people are doing something good, all of them are greetings from me.
GST is going to complete one year.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country, it has changed into reality today.
I would like to congratulate the states if I had to get credit for one national, one tax reform.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism, where all the states have decided together in the country and then such a large tax reform has been implemented in the country.
So far, two meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can all proud that people of different political ideology sit there, people of different states sit there, there are different preferred states but in addition to this, whatever decisions have been taken in GST Council, they have been taken unanimously.
Before GST, there were 1 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax has been implemented across the country.
GST is a victory of honesty and is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier, there used to be complaints of insector raj in the case of taxes several times in the country.
With the arrival of GST, the check post stopped and the movement of goods became faster, which is not only saving time but also benefiting from the Logistics sector.
GST is perhaps the worlds largest tax reform.
This huge tax reform was successful in India because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST was ensured by the peoples power.
Generally, it is believed that such a big reform, such a large country, it takes 5 to 5 years to ensure that the people of such a large number, but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the festival of honesty of the country, the result of the participation of the people, that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and it also improves through its input system as per requirement.
He has dedicated a very big success to the people of the country.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for the next moment to meet you and talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar
Through Mann Ki Baat, you have got the opportunity to be present again.
You will be aware of the fact that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea journey for several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama, I want to talk about it.
These six daughters of India have returned to India on 21st May and the entire country welcomed them in a very exciting manner by visiting the entire world through the medium of sea for more than a few days.
He travelled through various oceans and many seas, cutting a distance of about twelve thousand nautical miles.
This was the first such event in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these teachers and listen to their experiences.
If we seek the development journey of humanity then progress has emerged from some or the other adventure corner.
You must have seen that in the past few days, some new things have been taken into account about those who have been on Mount Everest, and for centuries, Everest has been challenging the human race and others have been accepting that challenge.
On 16th May, five tribal children from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manesh Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madwey, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam.
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur school, my young friends and my heart.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman from Nepal to Everest sir.
Congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya became the first Indian father-son to serve Everest.
It is not that only youths are fighting for Everest.
Sangeeta Bahle fought Everest on 1st May and Sangeeta Bahl's age is more than 50.
There are also some who have laughed at Everest who have shown that they are not only skilled but also sensitive.
Over the years, people have been fighting Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all these adventures, especially to the brave men.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, just two months ago when I talked about Fit India, I did not think that it would have such a good reflection.
A large number of people from all walks of life will come forward in support of it.
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
On social media, people are playing a video of fitness challenges and playing each other in it.
Today everybody is connected with this campaign of Fight India.
Whether it is the people associated with the film or the people associated with the sportsperson or the soldiers of the country, the teacher of the school, the sounds are heard everywhere - 'Hum Fit to India Fit'
It is a matter of great pleasure for me that I have also been given the Challenge by the Indian cricket team, Virat Kohli and I have accepted the Challenge.
I believe that this is a good thing and such challenges will encourage us to keep ourselves fit and to keep others fit.
Chhavi Yadav Ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that the sports which used to be a part of the lives of every child.
These games were particularly a special part of the summer vacation.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
They are also outside the house and are inside the house.
The unity hidden behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games.
One game is known by different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat.
I know that there is a game in Gujarat.
They are played with Kodi or Ambali Seed or Pasa and 88 square boards.
This game was played in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Which of us will be those who have not played Moi Dandiya in childhood
Moi Dandiya (Gilli Danda) is a game ranging from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Udaisha, it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vittidalu.
Some sports had their own season.
Like beetle is also a season for whistling.
When all the kites fly, when we play, we can express the unique qualities that we have.
You must have seen that many children are of shameful nature but they become very stunned while playing.
He expresses himself, the elders who are seen to be serious, while playing, one of them who is hidden comes out.
Traditional games have been created in such a way that along with physical capabilities, our integrity, concentration, consciousness and prosperity also increase.
From children to grandmother, grandmother, whenever everyone plays, then whatever is called Pella or Generation Gap, they get lost somewhere.
Many sports make us aware of society, environment etc.
Today, there is a need to promote these sports by coming forward in schools, ceremonies, youth boards etc.
We can create a very large collection of our traditional sports by crude sourcing.
My dear countrymen, our country will be celebrating the World Environment Day in the next five years.
It is an important achievement for India and is also accepting Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change.
The theme of this time is Beat plastic pollution.
My colleague has asked us to understand the spirit of this theme and to ensure that we do not use polythene, law grades plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, our wildlife and our health.
Go to the World Environment Day Website Wed-India 2018 and many suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to bring them in their daily life.
When there is extreme heat, the floods come, the name of stopping the rains does not take place, unbearable colds, then every person talks about global warming, climate change, but what is the work done by talking
In the last few weeks, we all saw that in different regions of the country there was dust storms, heavy winds and heavy rains.
Death also occurred, loss of lives.
All these things are the result of the changes in the climate system.
Our culture, our tradition has not taught us to combine with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had spoken about this thing on foot for the entire life.
When India played an important role in the CoP-21 and the Paris Agreement, when we coordinated the entire world through International Solar Alliance, there was a sense of fulfilling this dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this environment day, we all think of whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green.
How can we move forward in this direction
Can we become innovative
We can aim at planting a cruel tree this time and not only planting trees but also managing its maintenance until it grows up.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You remember now on 21st June, not just you, but the whole world remembers 21st June.
21st June is celebrated as International Yoga Day for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
Today there are reports that there are strong preparations to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day in the entire world.
Yoga for Unity and Carmonius society is a message that the world has experienced in the last few years.
By doing yoga, the courage is born which always protects us like a father.
The feeling of forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bharatuhari said that by doing regular yoga, the truth becomes our children, our sisters, our brothers and ourselves, our bed and knowledge become our hunger.
When all these qualities become partners of someone then the Yogi achieves victory over all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge the countrymen to build a more healthy, happy and harmonious nation ahead of our legacy of Yoga.
Today is the birth anniversary of the first big Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit Ji.
This memory of the month of May is also linked to another thing and it is Veer Savarkar.
This was the month of Mano in 1985 when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers were committed against injustice by showing their bravery.
It is a matter of sadness that we have been calling the 1985 incidents only rebellion or Sipahi rebellion for a long time.
In fact, this incident was seen as ignorant, but it was also an attempt to suppress our self-respect.
He was the Veer Savarkar who had written in silence that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but the first war of independence.
The Indian House of London, including Savarkar, celebrated its 50th anniversary with fervor.
It is also a wonderful combination that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month in which the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of specialities
He was a supplier of both scriptures and scriptures.
Generally, Veer Savarkar is known for his struggle against his bravery and the British Raj, but he was also an Oajswini poet and a social reformer who always emphasized the pride and unity.
An amazing description of Savarkar ji has been made by our dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had made a detailed picture.
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution.
Along with being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our bidders who were forced to ask for household after selling garbage - today they are learning the work of sewing to cover the poor.
I extend my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and trust, for their bright future.
He has shown that if you are inspired to do something and that is why you are determined then success can also be achieved amongst all the problems.
And that is not just the matter of Sikar, you will get to see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighborhood then you will be aware of how people overcome the problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some of the people present here.
This discussion also takes place in Rajkaran, social, filmmakers, sportspersons, sportspersons and other problems of the country. This kind of problem should be solved. But mostly these things remain limited to discussions but some people are those who move forward towards bringing about changes in their work, their hard work and perspective.
Shriman D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
Today, you will be surprised to know that more than 000 children are enjoying education in their lives.
He opened a school called Asha Ashwasan for children living in huts and spent 50 of their incomes on this poor tea seller.
He provides complete education, health and food to all the children coming to school.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, his attachment and giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
He has devoted the darkness of his life.
Who knows this Vedic ritual, but has shown it by living.
Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and all over the country.
You will also have a series of such inspirational incidents around you.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Let us move ahead with positiveness.
In the month of June, there is so much heat that people wait for rain and look at the clouds in the sky in hope.
A few days later, people will also wait for the moon.
The meaning of seeing the moon is that it can be celebrated.
After a month of fasting during sports, the festival of Eid is a symbol of celebration.
I am confident that everybody will celebrate Id with full enthusiasm, especially children will get good recognition on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Id will further strengthen the concept of equality in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games was held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
The world's 1 countries, including India, participated in it.
When such a big event happens, thousands of players from all over the world are participating in it, you can imagine how the atmosphere will be.
Observance, passions, enthusiasm, hopes, aspirations, aspirations and determination to show you something - when such a palace is there then who can keep it away from it.
Our sportspersons also performed a very good demonstration on the hopes of the countrymen.
Whether it is Shotining, Wrestling, Weightlifting, Table Tennis or Badminton, India has shown records.
26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze - India won a total of 66 medals.
This success gives pride to every Indian.
It is a matter of pride and happiness for medal winners.
It is an extremely glorious festival for the entire country and for all the countrymen.
Perhaps I will have less words to express this feeling.
But I want to tell you what I have heard from these players.
This time there were many things which were the first time.
Do you know that this time the number of workers from India in the Commonwealth Games has come to power.
Manika Batra won the medal in all the events.
He is the first Indian woman to win India as a gold medal in the Individual Teble Tennis.
India has got the highest medals in shooting.
Chaudhari is the only Indian Para Powder-Lifter who won medals at the Commonwealth Games.
This time the games were also special because most of the winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting or shooting, women players have earned money.
In Badminton, two players of India, Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
It was between Sindhu.
The athletes participating in the games came from different parts of the country, from small towns.
Their friends are also contributing to those who have maintained their courage in every situation.
I congratulate all those sportspersons and all of them.
Last month, I had requested the people of the country, especially the youth, to fit India and I have invited everyone to join such a fit India, to guide you to a fit India.
A well-known Shriman Shasikant Bhonsle has written in a swimming pool that - My weepon is my body, my delegation is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written, "I feel satisfactory and healthy with Morning walk.
He further says: "For me-fitness comes with a small and we should smile, when we are helpful".
There is no doubt that Happiness is only fitness.
Cine artist Akshay Kumar has laid a video on Twitter.
Many other youths have shared their experiences by linking them with the Fit India airports.
I understand that such movements are very beneficial for all of us and for all of us.
On 21st June, the International Day of Yoga has now been accepted by the entire world.
You should also prepare it now.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been shown is now becoming very popular.
My young friends, you will now be in the hurry of exams, exams and exams.
How to celebrate the holidays, where to go.
Outside the walls, there is an opportunity to live and experience life away from the computer.
My young friends, I am appealing to you today for a special internship.
The government has launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018, together with three ministries of the Government of India, Sports, HRD, Drinking Water.
Students and scientists of college, NCC youths, NSS youths, Nehru Yuva Kendras who ask for something to do, for the sake of society, for the sake of the change of society, for the sake of connecting themselves, for the sake of the society, for the sake of a positive energy, this is the occasion for everyone, and for the sake of cleanliness, and when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will also be satisfied with what we have done in the best, the best thing they have done in the college, will be given to every university at the national level.
Every intern who successfully completed this internship will be given a certificate by the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Not only that, the Internet which will complete it very well, the UGC will also provide two credit points to them.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of this for internationalship.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by going to MyGov app.
I hope that our youth will further pursue this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
You must send your guests, send stories, photographs, videos.
Let us create an opportunity to learn these holidays for a new experience.
I have seen in the past that the youths of Delhi are showing the things that are unemployed for the education of poor children.
The campaign, which started with 15 children in the huts near Gita College, Delhi, has joined 12 thousand children in the capital today.
The youngsters associated with this campaign are engaged in the efforts of social change by removing two hours of free time from their busy daily routine.
Brothers and sisters, similarly some farmers from the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become inspirational sources for the farmers across the country.
Their unified efforts not only changed their fate but also changed their fate.
Ragi, Rajgra, Makai or Java crops are mainly found in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
Due to being a hilly area, farmers could not get the right value.
But the farmers of Kapkot technologies, instead of selling these crops directly in the market, they adopted the path of value addition and adopted the path of value addition.
He started making biscuits from these commodities and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have created a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have also started a factory to build a biscuit.
Seeing the firmness of the farmers, the system has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being delivered not only to approximately 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has reached 10 to 15 lakh rupees, but more than 100 families have also started stopping those outside the district due to employment opportunities.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there is a war with water in the world in the future.
Everyone talks about this, but whether we have any responsibility or not
Do we not think that water conservation should be that social responsibility
Our ancestors have shown it alive for centuries.
He has given priority to the Mahatma of one drop of water.
He has discovered such new solutions how to save one drop of water .
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu wherein in temples, irrigation system, water conservation system, drought management, larger inscriptions have been written in the temple.
Be it Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatty or Pudukkottai, you will get to see a large number of inscriptions everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must observe Chand Baw in Jodhpur.
It is one of Indias largest and beautiful vessels and it is a matter of note that it is in the region where water is deficient.
April, May, June, July is the time that there is an excellent opportunity to accumulate rain water and if we prepare for advances only then we get the benefit.
Manrega's budget is also useful for this water conservation.
During the last three years, everybody has made efforts in the direction of water conservation and water management.
About 32 thousand crore has been spent on water conservation and water management separately from the Manrega Budget every year.
If we talk about 2018-18, I have spent about 55 percent of the total cost of 64 thousand crore rupees, that is, about 35 thousand crore rupees on water conservation.
During the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted through such water conservation and water management measures.
Some people have taken advantage of the budget that the Government of India provides for water conservation and water management.
Thousands of people working on the river Kuttumberur in Kerala have worked hard for 0 days and revived the river.
There are rivers full of Ganga and Yamuna but there are some areas in Uttar Pradesh, like two small rivers named Sasur Khadari of Fatehpur district.
A large number of soil and water conservation works have been undertaken by the district system under Manrega.
With the help of nearly 40-45 villages, this saline Khadiri river which was dried up was revived.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture, villages, how big blessings are these successes.
I would like to say that once again, April, May, June and July are in front of us, we will take responsibility for water conservation, we will also make some schemes and we will also show you something.
When Mann Ki Baat is there, I get messages from all over the world, papers and phones.
Imkumar Banerjee of Devi Tola village of North 24 Parganas of West Bengal has written in my Government, we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know the Peaceful Fully, Beauty Fully and Integrity of Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore.
Discuss this topic in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can know about it.
I express my gratitude to Ayen ji that the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat, given, was drawn towards this.
Gurudev Tagore was a complete personality with knowledge and wisdom, which has left his integral mark on everybody.
Rabindranath was a talented personality, a multi-dimensional personality, but a teacher inside him can feel every moment.
He has written in Gitanjali, "He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students.
I don't know the language of Bangla but when I was young, I had the habit of getting up very quickly - from childhood and the radio of East India begins soon.
When the delay starts in West India, I am guessing that in the morning, possibly 5.30 a.m., Ravindra Sangeet was started on radio and I had its habit.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Sangeet on the radio early in the morning and when I had the opportunity to listen to the poems of Anandloke and Agunar, Poreshmo.
You must have been impressed by Ravindra Sangeet and his poems.
I extend my best wishes to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramadan is celebrated with full respect and respect throughout the world.
The social aspect of everyday is that when a person is hungry, he also feels the hungryness of another.
When he is thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Pigmar Mohammed Sahib.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood from their lives.
Once a person asked Paigambar Saheb, what is the best thing in Islam
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
Pigambar Saheb believed in knowledge and compassion.
He was not supposed to do anything.
He used to say that ego only defeats knowledge.
Peacekeeper Mohammed Sahib believed that if you have more than requirements, you will give it to a needy person, therefore the donation in sports is also very important.
People give donations to the needy in this sacred month.
Pigambar Mohammad Saheb believed that no person is purified by his soul, not by wealth.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcases the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who has guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima recalls the responsibility of all of us to remember Lord Buddha, to try to walk on his path.
Lord Buddha is the inspirational strength of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values which are the most needed in today's world.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar emphasized that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social social social society.
Baba Saheb has empowered millions of people who have been buried in Hansia, who have been transformed, suffered, exploited, deprived and deprived.
This cannot be a big example of taxation.
This compassion for the sufferings of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and used to live with them with the rich ideals of Lord Buddha and they have been happening all the time.
We have got the teachings of Lord Buddha in the entire Asia.
And that is why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects important places of South-East Asia, special Buddhist places of India, where many countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar are associated with this tradition of Buddha.
I am also happy to note that the Government of India has partnered in the reconstruction works of several Buddhist temples, including the centuries-old magnificent Anand Temple in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, there is an abundance of human sufferings and the teachings of Lord Buddha shows ways to eradicate hatred.
I extend my best wishes to all those who believe in the principles of compassion to Lord Buddha spread all over the world.
I bless Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can take responsibility for building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, which says that Lafing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that Smiling is also associated with an important event of Indias defence history.
You must be wondering what is the connection between Smiling Buddha and India's military power
You will remember that on the evening of 11th May, 2018, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, spoke to the nation and his words filled the entire country with the moment of pride, pride and happiness.
That day was Buddha Purnima.
On the west side of India, on 11th May, 2018, the Paramani test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
Indias testing was successful and in a way, India had shown its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that the day has been marked in the history of India as an exhibition of its military power.
Lord Buddha has demonstrated to the world that inner strength, inner strength, inner strength and peace are essential.
Similarly, when you are strong in the form of a country, you can be peaceful with all of you.
The month of May, 2018 is not only important for the country that perambulation was tested in this month but it was done in the same way.
He showed the entire world that Indias land is the land of great scientists and India can achieve the heights and destinations with a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra: Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan Jai-Science.
We can also achieve a new joy and a new satisfaction for the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, I will talk more when I meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Thanks a lot.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the sacred festival of Ramnavami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this sacred festival of Ramnavami.
We have seen the power of the name Ram in his life every moment.
On 26th January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN were here, they brought a cultural trip with them and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting Ramayana before us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana, not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries in this territory of the world, are creating similar inspiration and influence even today.
Once again I wish you all the best for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time I have received all your letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
I read what Kamal Thakur ji wrote about starting the online course of Sanskrit on MyGov.
It was very good to see you in love with Sanskrit as well as being an IT professional.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I will also request the Shrota of Mann Ki Baat who works in respect of Sanskrit to consider what can be done in the context of Communications.
Shriman Dhanshyamkumar ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar. You have read the comments written on the NarendraModiApp.
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is very important.
Shriman Shakal Shastri Ji, Karnataka
You have also requested everyone to keep water for animals and birds in summer.
Sakal ji, I have delivered your feelings to all the sources.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji has to say that I will talk to the youth about their health this time.
They feel that compared to the countries of Asia, our youngsters are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk to everyone in detail about health and talk about Fit India.
And you can also run the initiative of Fight India by meeting all the youngsters.
In the past, the Prime Minister of France had visited Kashi. The Hon'ble Prime Minister of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of this journey were touching and affecting the heart.
And he requested that all those issues should be published on all the video social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had placed that on the same day on social media and Narendra ModiApp.
Now you lick them and retweet them, bring your friends.
He has sent me only by writing the ideas that he has come in his heart from Chennai to Andha, Jaisal and many children have given the gratitude cards behind the Exam Warrior book.
Blind, Jaisesh, I want to tell you all the children that your letters leave my day long tiredness.
All such letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I could read, whatever I could hear and there are many of these things that touched my heart, but perhaps for months I have to go on saying something continuously.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about the examination.
He said his scheme on holidays.
In summers, water is concerned for animals and birds.
Brothers and sisters, There have been letters about the activities that are going on in the country regarding Kisan Melas and farming.
Some active citizens have sent instructions for water conservation.
During the festivals, our festivals, our culture and our traditions are discussed.
That is, the words of our minds also change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the words of our mind change somewhere the season of life of somebody.
And why not
In these words, in your experiences, in these examples, all the inspirations, all the energy, all the self-confidence, all of you are inspired to do something for the country.
He has the power to change the weather throughout the country.
When I read in your letters how Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw driver from Assam's Karimganj, has built new schools for the poor children on his own will, then this country's immense will power is seen.
In this mission, Sadul sold household houses and collected money through donation.
Many travellers who travelled in their cab gave generous donations.
An engineer girl gave her first step
Thus, after 12 years of collection of rupees, Sadul Laskar brought the color of the brave efforts and today, due to his hard work, he is ready to become a nearly 30-bed hospital in the village of Renewable University near Kolkata.
This is the strength of New India.
Today, the perspective of India has changed all over the world.
Today, there is a belief in every section of the country that in the youth, in women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, in every section.
We can move ahead and our country can move ahead.
There is a positive atmosphere of self-confidence filled with hopes.
This self-confidence, this positiveness will fulfil our resolve to accomplish new India.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months, it is very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why many letters have come about agriculture.
This time I look at the video of the discussions with the farmers on the DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and I feel that every farmer should be associated with this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri Ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and common life of the country.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji used to emphasize the requirements of plants, trees and plants and otherwise agricultural structures.
Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of mass awareness on a large scale for our farmers to ensure far-reaching income, otherwise infrastructure, and to enhance food and milk production.
In his speech in 1, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji emphasized the need to use new technology and innovate the farmers.
I had visited the Agricultural Universe Festival held in Delhi in the past.
It was a pleasant experience for me to know, understand, understand, innovate about agriculture, but what I was most impressed was the hard work of the Meghalaya and the farmers.
This state with less area has shown a lot of work.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced vastly over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goals are determined, there is surely strong and there is a determination in the mind, it can be achieved and shown.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is being supported by technology, which is strengthening the agricultural producer.
In the letters that have come to me, I was watching that many farmers had written about the spirit of technology and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, This year, a big decision has been taken in the budget to provide the farmers the right price for the crops.
It has been decided that the price of fixed crops will be declared at least one and a half times their cost.
Its efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the villages with the Wheelsale Market and then the Global Market.
The farmers will not have to go far away to sell their produce. For this, 22 thousand rural houses of the country will be connected with APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading them with the necessary interface.
In a way, a direct connectivity of any market in the country is being made with the fields.
My dear countrymen, this year, the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will be inaugurated.
How will the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our commitment and how can it give Gandhiji the best tribute to hundreds of crores of people
How can new activities be accepted for this
I request you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
How is the logo of Gandhi 150
You should inform yourself about how the slogan or the mantra or the voice is spoken.
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and recall Bapu and take inspiration from them and bring our country to new heights.
Thank you, you have said the truth and I believe that both Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are fulfilling each other.
Today, in the field of health, the country has moved ahead with the traditional approach.
Every work related to health in the country was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, whether it is the Ministry of Health and Ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Protection, the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments are working together for healthy India and the emphasis is on forefrontable health with preventive health.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And as much as we are aware of the preventive health care, the people, the family and the society will also benefit.
The first requirement for life to be healthy is cleanliness.
We all have emerged as a country and the result has been that in the last four years, the sanitation coverage has doubled by almost 80 percent.
Besides, work is being done on a wide scale to create Health Welfare Centres across the country.
This is the result of the commitment of all of us that Yoga has become a collective movement and has reached home today.
The International Yoga Day of this time is less than 100 days left for 21st June.
On the last three International Yoga Days, people participated with great enthusiasm everywhere in the country and the world.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and all of them for yoga.
In a new interesting way, Yoga has to be popularised in children, youths, elderly, all age groups, men or women.
However, the country's TV and electronic media do different programmes during the year, but can you create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I need Yoga Practicesperson but some people have made me Yoga Teacher through their creativity and have made 3D animated videos by doing my yoga.
I shall share that video with you all so that we can study asana and pranayama as well.
Efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is within reach and nutrition is also cheap and accessible for the common man.
The cost of heart stents has been reduced to 85 percent for heart patients.
In the current 4 medical colleges of the country, the number of MBBS seats has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS (AIIMS) are being set up in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
We all will see a collective effort to get rid of B.
Years ago Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indian industrialization.
The industry was an effective medium for them to provide jobs to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when the Make in India campaign is going on successfully in the country, Dr.
Ambedakar ji had dreamed of India as an Industrial Sovereignty, his vision is inspiration for us today.
Today, India is emerging as a brightest point in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct FDI in the world is coming to India.
The entire world is looking at India as a centre for innovation, innovation and development.
The idea that the development of industries would be possible only in the cities was due to which Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on the urbanization of India.
He doesnt want a person to live his life in poverty.
He also believed that their poverty cannot be eliminated only by sharing something among the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke about ports and waterways when only roads and railways were discussed in India in the decade of 130 and 140.
He's Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw the water power as the national power.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the vision of various River Valley Authorities and Water related Aayogs.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on different coasts of India and the Inter-Malkha is being strengthened at the old ports.
During the period of the 40th century, most of the discussions were held on World War II, Cold War and Division.
Ambedkar had laid the foundation stone of Team India Spirit.
He spoke of the importance of Federalism, and emphasized on working together with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism and cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance, and the most important thing is that Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me.
He has shown us that to move forward, it is not necessary that a big or a immortal family be born, but those born in the poor families of India can also dream of fulfilling their dreams and can achieve success.
Yes, it has also been created that many people have made Dr.
He tried to push them back and every possible effort was made to ensure that the poor and the backward families cannot move forward, nothing can be done, nothing can be achieved in life.
But the difference between New India is quite different.
An Indian who belongs to Ambedkar belongs to the poor and to the backward.
Under this, there will be various programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice throughout India.
My friend is insistent on taking part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are going to be held in the coming days. Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Ester, Vaisakhi.
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The vision of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of Ahimsa, will inspire us all.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
The inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus Christ remind the people of peace, equality, justice, mercy and compassion.
In April, the festival of Baisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in these days, Judashital and Satuvani in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and the humidity and joy of Poila Baisakhi in West Bengal will continue.
All these festivals are somehow associated with our agricultural fields and foodgrains, through these festivals, we thank nature for the valuable gifts we get in the form of yields.
Once again, my best wishes to all the festivals that you will face.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
My dear countrymen, today we have started Mann Ki Baat from a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science.
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought that the river or the sea, why water becomes colorful
This question came into the mind of a young man in the decade of the 120s.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
Raman's name comes to us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for the best work on light scattering i. e.
One of his discovery is known as Raman Effect.
We celebrate the National Science Day every year on 28th February, as it is said that this day, light-scattering incident was discovered for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in science.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great genius Bodhyan, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhat, while on the other hand, we are proud and glorious in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana and Satyendranath Bose are proud of India.
The renowned Particle Boson was also named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai - for the inauguration of the Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that have taken place in science.
This technology can be used to enhance the lives of poor, deprived or needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to help in facilitating the lives of the disabled brothers and sisters.
Can Artificial Intelligence help in facilitating healthcare and modernizing diseases
Just a few days ago, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had got the opportunity to visit the inauguration of the I Creat in Gujarat, Ahmedabad.
There a young man has developed such a digital institution that if anyone cannot speak, he can translate himself into an interaction with the medium of an instrument and he can interact in the same way as a person who can speak.
I understand that we can use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology are valuable.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will work as we want.
But it depends on us what we ask for from the machine.
Here human goals become important .
Use of science for humanitarian welfare, use for enhancing the highest heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Addison, who invented lightbulbs, has failed many times in his experiments.
It is fortunate that today I am in Auroville, the Karmabhoomi of the Maharshi Arabics.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, raised questions on their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he made questions about every aspect of life.
Answer the response and waited for the people.
The spirit of repeated questions to know the truth is important.
This is also the true inspiration behind scientific research.
I extend my best wishes to all our scientists and scientists on the occasion of National Science Day.
My best wishes to our young generation for the discovery of truth and knowledge and to be inspired by science to serve society.
Friends, At the time of Katokti, many times I get messages about all these things, people keep writing something or the other.
Shri Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken about the occupational safety in his comments on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that security standards on factory and construction sites in our country are not so good.
The next 4th March is Indias national peacekeeping day, the Prime Minister spoke of salute in his Mann Ki Baat programme so that people get awakened by peace.
When we talk of peace, two things are very important - one Proactiveness and the other Priparedness.
There are two kinds of salutes - one that is required at your time, the safety during dessert and the other that is required in daily life, the safety in avarid life.
If we are not aware of peace in everyday life, we cannot achieve it then it becomes difficult to get it during your days.
We all read the boards written on the paths several times. It says, Awareness has come down, accidents have come down, do not leave the world at the earliest of losses, losses, joys and comforts, do not enjoy any fun from the security of the country, but these words are never used in our lives.
If we are cautious and follow the necessary rules then we can save our lives, but we can also overcome the society with great accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that many letters are written on the workplace, but when we see it, it does not seem to be following it.
I urge the municipalities and municipalities that have a fire brigade, they should go to schools once a week or once a month and drive them in front of school children.
There will be two benefits - the Fire Brigade will also have the habit of being cautious and the new generation also gets its education and there will be no different expenditure for it.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDM) is leading the country in the country.
The initiative called 'Apada Mitra' has also been taken for the training of volunteers in floods, cyclone risks.
Teaching and awareness play a very important role.
Today, two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year with Lu-Heatways.
After this, NDM organised workshops for the prevention of Hydropower and launched a campaign to bring awareness among the people.
There was a good result of everyone's participation.
In 2011, the number of deaths due to Lu declined surprisingly to nearly 20.
It can be found from this that if we give priority to security then we can get protection.
There are innumerable people who work like this in society, social organizations, awakening citizens. I want to describe everybody who works for relief and rescue within the minutes.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is not less.
(BIMSTEC) - Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal were also conducted a Joint Dessert Management Exercise of these countries, which was one of the first and largest human experiments.
We have to become a risk-concession society.
In our culture, we always talk about the safety of values, safety of values, but we have to understand the values of values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
This means what was the system of information
Because we are not aware of nature and for that we listen after sitting in our ears and airspace, but none of us feel that this information is for me.
The same experience is in every field of our lives.
We should not think that Safety is for someone else, if we all become aware of our peace then the feelings of satisfaction are also included in it.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana aims to cleanse the villages and to create wealth and energy by transforming animal dung and farm waste into a compound and bio gas.
Some European countries and China, animal dung and other organic wastes are used for the production of energy, but its full potential is not being used in India.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural, we are now moving ahead in this direction.
The goal of utilising Dor's dung, waste from the farm, waste from the kitchen house is to create a biogas-based energy.
Under Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not only as a waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit rural areas.
Animal health will improve and improve productivity.
Biogas will enhance self-reliance in energy for cooking food and lighting.
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing the income.
New jobs will be available for the sale of forest collection, transportation, bye-governance etc.
An online Trading platform will also be set up for smooth management of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect farmers with buyers so that the farmers get the right price for Gobar and Agricultural Waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating cooperative societies by creating a self-help group.
I invite you to become partners of this movement of clean energy and green jobs.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard about music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, in which the first waste festival was organized in the state.
The objective behind the festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness, to use the creativity of the city's waste and to create awareness about various ways to reuse the garden.
During the Festival, there were several kinds of activities which included students from generation to generation.
Different types of artworks were made using waste.
Workshops were organized to train people on all aspects of the waste management.
Music performance took place on the theme of cleanliness. Art work was made.
Inspired by Raipur, different types of waste festivals were also held in other districts.
Everyone talked about innovative ideas about Swachhta initiated by their parents and poetry was read.
An atmosphere like a festival has been prepared for cleanliness.
The manner in which schoolchildren particularly participated was amazing.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration for the innovative way to showcase the importance of waste management and cleanliness.
International Womens Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
There are several programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, those women who have performed accordingly in different fields have also been awarded the Shakti Puraskar in the country.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's words.
Today, it is our brothers responsibility to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are a part of the tradition where men were identified with women, Yashodanandan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhi Puth, this was the identity of a son.
Today, our women power has introduced self-sufficiency and self-sufficiency with their work.
He has not only pursued himself, but has also worked to pursue the country and society and to take it to a new chatti.
At the same time, the dream of a New India is the same where women are empowered, they are equal partners in the entire development of the country.
In the past, somebody had made me a very beautiful suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March there are several programmes to celebrate the Women's Day. Can the programme of the honor of the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village-slum be organized
And you can talk about a long life and I feel good and I am bringing it to you.
About 15 lakh women under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and this data is not small, 15 lakh women have organized a month-long Swachhta Abhiyan.
Since 26th January, 2018, these women have set up a new example by constructing 1 lakh 0 thousand toilets in just 20 days under this campaign.
You can imagine how big this is.
These women from Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is the power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will effectively transform the Swachhta Abhiyan and Swachhta Sanskrit into the common man's nature.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 0 years of independence and that is why there is a lot of pride and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know that Elephant Island is 10 kms away from Mumbai .
I am surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephant for so many years of independence.
For 0 years, the three villages of the Elephant Islands, Rajbandar, Moorbandar and Sethbandar, have become dark and their life has become illuminating.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted with electricity.
This is not just a power but a new beginning of development partners.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness more than that, whether the lives of the countrymen are illuminated or happy in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
Now, this is the special feature of the month of March, the fields decorated with luxurious crops, the golden splendor of wheat enjoying and the beauty of the orange water that blossoms the heart.
But this month we all are very fond of the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March, the whole country will celebrate Holi with Harsh Vallas.
The more important is the Holika Dahan because this day is the day to destroy the evils by burning them in fire.
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all condolences, to be a part of each others happiness and conveys the message of love unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to all fellow citizens on the occasion of Holi.
This festival will be full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat of 2018 and two days ago, we celebrated Republic Day with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history, it was made that a large number of 10 countries were present here.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the NarendraModiApp and has requested me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written that on February 1, the imagination that goes to the space is the death anniversary of Chawla.
He left us in the Kalambia Space Yan accident but inspired millions of young people around the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has started his long letter with the farewell of imagination Chawla.
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost the imagination chawla at such a young age, but he gave a message to thousands of youngsters of India, especially in the whole world, that there is no limit for women power.
If there is a desire and determination, there is a strong desire to do something then nothing can be impossible.
It is heartening to see that women in India are moving fast in every field and the country is enhancing their pride.
Since ancient times, women's dignity in our country, their place in society and their contributions have been inspiring the whole world.
There has been a long tradition of Indian scholars.
Many of Indias rebels have been contributing to the creation of Vedas.
There are several names like Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitrey.
Today, we talk of 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' but it has been said in our scriptures, Skandapuran centuries ago: Dasaputra Samakanya, Dasaputrana Promotion.
The more you get from ten goddesses, the more you get from a daughter.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And that is why, in our society, women have been given the status of Shakti.
This women's strength binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and unity.
Shriman Prakash Tripathy has given a lot of examples.
He has written that our brave defence Prime Minister Nirmala Sitharas is inspiring to fly in the Ladakh Vehicles Sukhoi 30.
He also mentioned that under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, Indian Navy's women crew members are undertaking the entire world on the INSV switch.
Three brave women have become emotional, Mohan Singh and Avani Chaturvedi fighter pilots and are taking training in Sukhoi-30.
All Women crew under the leadership of Shakti Vajpayee flew from Delhi to Sun Francisco, USA and Air India Boeing Jet to Port Delhi.
In the past, Hon'ble President ji took a new initiative.
The President visited a group of extraordinary women who had done something first in the field of Petroleum.
The country's Viman Achieveers, the first woman merchant Navy captain, the first lady train driver of passenger train, the first lady fire fighter, the first lady bus driver, the first lady to reach Antarctica, the first lady to reach Everest.
Our women powers have achieved an extraordinary achievement by breaking the conventionalism of society.
He said that a new path can be made by crossing all the strategies and obstacles on the strength of hard work, perseverance and determination.
A road that will not only inspire our contemporaries but also many generations to come.
He will be filled with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book on the first ladies of the Women Activity has also been prepared so that the whole country can know about these women powers, inspire them from their lives and their work.
It is also available in the form of e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, the country's women power has an important role in positive transformations in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you must have been wondering what is the connection between the two
Matunga Station, Mumbai is the first station in India where all women employees are present.
Whether it is a commercial department or a railway police, a ticket checker, a voter or a point personalist or more than 40 employees have staff women.
This time, after seeing the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that one of the most important topics of the parade was BSF Biker Continent, in which all women were participating.
He was experimenting with courage and this scene was also surprised by the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our NITI Aayog is under leadership.
When the words of tribal women come, there is a definite glimpse in the minds of all, in which there are forests, footpaths, on which the ladies of ladies are lifted up on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has made a new progress in front of the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area, creates a terrible atmosphere of violence, bomb, gun, pistol and Maoists.
In such a dangerous area, tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running E-Rikshaw.
In a short span of time, many women have been associated with it.
And three benefits are being made from this, on the one hand, where self-employed people have worked to empower them, on the other hand, there is a change in the coverage of Maoist-affected areas.
And along with all this, it is also strengthening the environmental protection work.
Over the centuries, continuous efforts have been made at the individual and social level in our country against social evils and commitments.
Just a few days back Bihar made an interesting initiative.
Human chain, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers, was built to root out social evils in the state.
Through this campaign, people have been awakened against evils such as childish and dowry practices.
The entire state resolved to fight with evils such as dowry and child marriage.
Children, old people, youngsters, mothers and sisters, who were full of enthusiasm and enthusiasm, had participated in this jungle.
The human chain, which started from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, was unfoundedly connected to the borders of the state.
It is important for all the people of the society to get the benefit of development in a true sense that our society is free from these evils.
Let us take a pledge to finish such evils from the society and create a New India, a powerful and capable India.
I congratulate the people of Bihar, the chief of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain, who took such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov.
He was not aware of the Prime Minister Janaushadhi Kendra earlier.
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and purchased medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 5 percent.
He expressed his desire that I will talk about it in Mann Ki Baat programme so that most people can get information and benefit from it.
For the past few years, many people used to write and tell me about this.
I have also seen videos and social media of several people who have benefitted from this scheme.
And when I get this kind of information then it is very happy.
There is a deep satisfaction.
And I am also very happy that Shriman Darshan ji's mind has come to know that whatever he has got is also available to others.
The objective behind this scheme is to create healthcare and promote Ease of Living.
The medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 0 of the branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps people, especially senior citizens who take medicines everyday, get a lot of economic help.
The generic medicines sold in it are in accordance with the determination of World Health Organization.
This is the reason that good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides affordable medicines but also provides new employment opportunities for industrial engineers.
Affordable medicines are available at PM Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Amrut Stores of Hospitals.
The only purpose behind all this is to make the poorest of the poor people quiet and forward health services available so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra, Narendra Modi has shared a photo on the mobile app.
The photograph was such that my attention was drawn towards the photographs.
The photograph was such that a grandson was taking part in the cleanliness drive of the Clean Morna river with her grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the river Morona under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river of Morana flowed in the first 12 months but now it has become seasonal.
The other painful thing is that the river was completely filled with wild buffaloes.
Several wastes were being put on the river and its banks.
Action Plan was launched and one day before the Makar Sankranti, on 13th January, under the first phase of Mission Clean Morona, the two banks of the river Morocco were cleaned at four places in four kms.
More than six thousand people of Akola, more than 100 NGs, college students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters, everybody participated in this work of Mission Clean Moor.
On January 20, 2018, this cleanliness programme was continued in the same way and I was told that this campaign will run every Saturday morning until the river of Morona is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then nothing is impossible.
Big changes can be brought through mass movement.
I extend my heartfelt thanks to the people of Akola, the people of the district and the municipal administration, every citizen engaged in making this work a mass movement and this effort will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of discussions about the Padma Awards.
Even in newspapers, this topic also attracts attention on TV.
But if you look very smoothly, you will be proud of the fact that how the great people are amongst us and it will also be proud of the fact that today the common man in our country is reaching the heights without any provocation.
Every year there has been a tradition of giving Padma Awards but in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
The entire process has become transparent due to online.
In a way, the selection process has changed completely.
Now there is no identity of the person but the importance of his work is increasing.
You will be happy to know that Arvind Ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has dedicated his entire life to making sportspersons for children.
He has been making sportspersons from the garbage for four decades so that the curiosity towards science can increase in children.
Their efforts are to inspire the children towards scientific experiments from useless things, for which they are going to three thousand schools across the country and showing films made in 18 languages and inspiring children.
How a marvellous life, how a marvellous dedication
One such thing is the Sitawa Juddiqui of Karnataka.
They are not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, he has contributed greatly in changing the lives of countless women in Belagavi.
He dedicated himself to Devdasi at the age of seven, but then he spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdasis.
Not only this, he has done unprecedented work for the welfare of the women.
Shriman Bhajjo Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
He used to do ordinary jobs for life savings but he was very fond of making traditional tribal pictures.
Today, due to this grief, he is not only in India but also in the whole world.
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhujj Shyam ji, who illuminated India's name abroad, was recognized and honored with the Padma Shri.
You will be surprised to hear about Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutti.
Lakshmikutti is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of thorny leaves in the tribal area amidst dense forests.
He has built 500 herbal medicines on the basis of his memory.
He has got Maharath in making medicines used after snake bites.
Lakshmi Ji is constantly serving the society with her knowledge of her herbal medicines.
He was honored with the Padma Shri for his contribution to the society by recognizing this innocence.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils and vegetables to build a hospital.
When he was 23 years old, his husband was killed due to lack of treatment and the incident inspired him to become a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated freely in their hard worked hospital.
I am confident that there are many such males and males in our country, there are many males and males who do not know anybody.
But I would like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who live around us, who are dedicated to society, who work with some particular thing, who are working with some particular kind of society. Sometimes they should be brought among the society.
He does not work for respect but because of his work, we are inspired.
Sometimes, in schools, colleges, such people should listen to their experiences by calling them.
Beyond the rewards, some efforts should also be made in the society.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year on 9th January.
This is the 9th January, when the devotee Mahatma Gandhi rose to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the festival of unbreakable bondage between Indians living in India and around the world.
This year, we had organized a programme on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, inviting every member of the Indian origin and mayors across the globe.
You will be happy to know that in this programme, from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Morocco, Fiji, Tanzania, Canada, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and USA and some other countries where our original Indian mayor is the original Indian Parliament.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries as well as they have also maintained their strong relations with India. This time they have sent me to the European Union, the European Union, in which they have shown their contribution in different fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Our original Indians who live in different countries of Europe, some are working in cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some are dedicated to their music and some are decorated with their poems.
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, to recognise the people of Indian origin and to give information to the people around the world through them.
On 30th January, there is a revered Bapu's death anniversary, which has shown us a new path.
At present, we see every step that Bapu's words were so true.
If we imagine that we walk on the path of Bapu, how much we can walk - what can be greater than that
My dear countrymen, with the best wishes to you all in 2018, I resolve my speech.
Mann Ki Baat December, 2019
This is the last event of Mann Ki Baat this year and the combination is also the last day of the year 2019.
We and you have shared a lot of things this year.
This exchange of your letters, comments and ideas for Mann Ki Baat brings a new energy for me.
The year will change after a few hours, but this sequence of our talks will continue even further.
In the coming year, we will talk more innovatively, we will share new experiences.
Many congratulations to you all for the year 2018.
Today, on 25th December, the festival of Natal was celebrated with fervor throughout the world.
In India too, people celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we recall the great message of Christianity and what Isha Christ had emphasized was Savabhav.
My dear countrymen, this year Guru Gobind Singh ji's 350th Prakash Parv was also the year.
Guru Gobind Singh jis courage and extraordinary life is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and lived his life on the basis of these life values.
A Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, such a Guru Gobind Singh ji worked to inspire people in all these roles.
He fought against generation and injustice.
He urged the people to break the bonds of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he had to lose a lot personally.
But he never gave a place to the feeling of grief.
In every moment of life, the message of love, sacrifice and peace was his personality full of great features.
Let us take all our commitments and try to transform our lives by taking inspiration from Guru Gobind Singh ji's great teachings and his inspirational life.
Those who are born in 20000 or later will become eligible voters from January 1, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the new Indian voters of the 21st century.
I congratulate these youngsters and I urge all of you to register as voters.
The whole of India is keen to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
You will also be proud of the voter of the 21st century.
Your opinion will be the foundation of New India.
The power of vote is the biggest strength in democracy.
Death is the most effective means of bringing about positive changes in the lives of millions of people.
You can also become the builder of the 21st century India and it has been started in a special way since January 1.
And today in my Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to our youngsters full of energy and determination of 18 to 25 years.
I am confident that the dream of our new India will be fulfilled by the skills and strength of our energetic youth.
When we talk of a New India, the New India is free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Be free from dirt and poverty.
New India where there is equal opportunity for everyone, where the aspirations and aspirations of everyone are fulfilled.
New India where our inspiration is the strength of peace, unity and harmony.
My new India Youth will come forward and deliberate on how to create a New India.
He will also set a path for himself, connect him with whom he is associated and continue to move forward.
You have also moved ahead and the country has also moved ahead.
Now, when I am talking to you, I had a thought that can we organize a mock parlor in every district of India
Where these 18-25-year-old youngsters sit together and build up on new India, find ways and plans.
How can we prove our commitments before 2022
How can we build an India whose dream was seen by our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for the magnificent and divine India of the 21st century.
How can achieve success with determination
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and intellectualship, our youngsters are coming forward and are getting successful.
I would like to know about all these opportunities, how to get this New India Youth at one place and create a system in this regard so that they can easily get information about this world and they can also get the necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I spoke to you about the importance of positiveness.
I remember a shloka of Sanskrit. This means that a person full of enthusiasm is extremely strong because nothing can be beyond enthusiasm.
There is nothing impossible for a person with positiveness and enthusiasm.
People in English also say - 'Pessimism Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power'.
I had appealed to the countrymen in Mann Ki Baat last year to share your positive moments of the year 2019 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am very happy that a large number of people gave a very positive response to the social media platform, MyGov and the NarendraModi App.
There were lakhs of tweets with the POSITIVE India Hashtag (POSITIVE India Hashtag).
In a way, the communication of positiveness that took place in India spread all over the world.
The tweets and reflections that came were really inspiring.
It was a pleasant feeling.
Some countrymen have shared this year's events which had a special impact on their minds.
Some people also shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Faiz One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I talk to the bondle.
Our insurance covered a premium of one rupee per month.
My husband had done it and he was abrogated in an accident.
We only know what happened to us at that time.
This helped us get a lot of benefit from the government and I could get a little more meeting with it.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
The National Highway has been passed from our village, from Bhinnar village to 2019.
This will improve our roads and increase trade.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish.
There was a problem of water in our region. For the last 40 years, we had to depend on the arminy pipeline.
Now this pipeline has taken place separately - free.
So all these big achievements are in our 2019.
There are many people who are doing such things at the level of self-reliance, which are creating positive changes in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India which we are building together.
Let us enter the new year with the happiness of this small country and start a new year and strive towards progressive India.
When we talk of positiveness, I also want to share one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspirational aspects of the administrative service topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk.
He has secured the first rank in the examination of the Kashmir Administrative Services by coming out of the bond of terrorism and hostility.
You will be surprised to know that in the 10th century the terrorists had burnt their native house.
Terrorism and violence were so much that their family had to leave their native land.
For a small child, all such violence was sufficient to create darkness and bitterness in his heart. But Anjum did not let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of service of the people.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration for not only Jammu Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that however bad the situation may be, the clouds of despair can also be dispersed by positive actions.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu Kashmir.
And when I was listening to them, they ask for progress in what fields of life.
The more I spent with those daughters, I got inspiration and this is the strength of the country, this is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is very natural to talk about Sabarimala Mandir of Kerala whenever the world's famous religious places are discussed.
In this world famous temple, millions of devotees come here every year to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
Where such a large number of devotees come, where such a large number of places are Mahatmaya, how big challenge is it to maintain cleanliness
And particularly those places which are situated between the mountains and the forests.
But the Sabarimala Temple itself is an example of how this problem can be changed in culture, how to find out the way to come out of the problem and how it is so powerful in public participation.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan launched a program called 'Punayam Punkwanam' and launched a voluntary campaign for cleanliness under the programme.
And made a tradition that the journey of those travelers who come is not completed until they do not do any physical labor in the cleanliness programme.
This campaign is neither big nor small.
Every traveller, after understanding a part of Lord's puja, gives some time for cleanliness, works and works to remove the dirt.
Everyday in the morning the view of cleanliness is very amazing and all the pilgrims take part in it .
No matter how big accomplishment, no matter how rich a person, no matter how big an officer, every person becomes a part of this Punyam Punkwanam programme like a common traveller, only after cleaning it.
We have many such examples for the countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan in Sabarimala and Purnima Punkwanam become part of the journey of every traveller.
There is a strict commitment to cleanliness along with hard work.
My dear countrymen, on October 2, 2014, we all have resolved that the incomplete task of worshipping Bapu is clean India, free India from dirt.
Puja Bapu continued to sweep for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that when Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, we will do something in his dream of giving India, Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made on a wide scale across the country in the direction of cleanliness.
Changes are also seen in the rural and urban areas.
The worlds largest survey - Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted between 4th January to 10th March 2018 to examine the quality of sanitation in urban areas.
This survey will be done in more than four thousand cities in about 40 crore people.
In this survey, the facts that will be tested and the innovative efforts made for open defecation, waste collection, transport system for carrying waste, scientific waste processing, efficient building and sanitation efforts made by the people and partners for this work.
During this survey, he will visit different places and inspire the cities.
They will react with the citizens.
Use of Swachhata App and analysis of improvements in various types of service sites.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities to make the cleanliness of the city the habit of the people and become the habit of the city.
Cleanliness should not be done only by the government.
Every citizen and civil organisation is also very important.
And I appeal to all my citizens to participate in the cleanliness that is going to be served in the coming days.
And your city will not remain behind, you will not be lagging behind.
I am confident that the use of green and blue wastes by separating dry waste and wet waste from home will have become your habit.
It should be a matter of public discussion in every city from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, in this cleanliness survey, in this healthy competition of cleanliness.
And you should have a dream of brotherhood, our city - our efforts, our progress - progress of the country.
With this resolve, we will once again recall the revered Bapu and take a pledge of Swachh Bharat and lay the foundation stone of Purusharath.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small, but in the form of a society, our identity is to be influenced far and wide.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share such a thing with you.
It is a matter of fact that if a Muslim woman asks for a Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go without 'Maharam' or her male guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time, I thought how this could happen.
Who would have made such rules
Why such discrimination is there
And when I went deep into it, I was troubled - even after 0 years of independence, we were the people who had installed such a restaurant.
Over the decades, there has been injustice to Muslim women but there was no discussion.
Even in many Islamic countries, there is no such rule.
But in India, Muslim women did not get this authority.
And I am happy that our government has taken care of it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs also took the necessary steps and ruined the tradition that has been going on for this 0 years, we have destroyed this destination.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without honour and I am glad that this time about 130 Muslim women have made an appeal to Haj without honour and from different parts of the country, from Kerala to North, women have expressed their willingness to visit Haj.
I am confident that India's development journey, on the strength of our women's strength, will continue to move ahead with the confidence of their talent.
We should constantly try to ensure that our women also get equal rights, equal opportunities, so that they can move forward on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This time there will be no one but ten chief guests on Republic Day.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2019 has been special for both the countries of ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2019 and 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN was completed in 2019.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians to be present together on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this festival is a season and our country is a country of festivals in a way.
There will hardly be a day in which no festival has been written.
Now we all have celebrated Christmas and a new year is going to come forward.
The coming New Year brings happiness, happiness and prosperity to you all.
Let us all move ahead with a new zeal, a new enthusiasm, a new zeal and a new resolve.
The month of January is the time for the sun to rise and this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated.
In Punjab and North India, Lohari is enjoyed, while UP-Bihar waits for Khichadi and sesame culture.
Say Sankrant in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, each festival is special in itself and they have their own importance.
These festivals are celebrated from 13th to 1st January.
The names of these festivals are different, but their basic elements are the same - the link between nature and agriculture.
Best wishes to every countrymen for these festivals.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much.
Now we will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
The interaction was similar that interacts with a very talented younger brother and his elder sister.
Listen, how Lata Didi is eager to all the things related to the country, and the satisfaction of life is also in Indias progress, changing India, new heights are in India.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranama.
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Lata Deedi: Pranama.
Modi ji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday..
When will you go and turn the veil
Modi ji: I will come back on the 28th late night and on the 2nd morning and then you will be born.
Lataji: There are many people in the old age but it is a great deal to get the blessings of those who are bigger than their work.
Modi ji: Deedi, you are very old and you are also very old and you are also very big in doing business and you have achieved this achievement by doing so and penance.
Netaji: Yes, I think that my parents are blessings and the blessings of the sages.
I'm nothing.
Modi ji: Today is your humility, it is a great education for all of our new generations.
It is a great inspiration for us that even after doing so much clear in life, it has always given priority to your parents' culture and humility.
LATAGE:
And I am happy that when you proudly say that your mother was Gujarati.
And whenever I came to you, G. Modi ji gave me something Gujarati.
I know that your coming is changing the picture of India and I am very happy about it.
No, I don't ask you to give you a lot of trouble because I look at you, I know how busy you are and how much you work.
What to think
When you visited and touched your mother's feet, I had also sent somebody and took their blessings.
Yes, yes.
My father was very happy because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will come very soon.
It would be my privilege.
Modi ji: Pranam ji.
My best wishes to you.
Modi ji: Pranam ji.
My dear countrymen, along with Navaratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new energy, new enthusiasm and new determination.
There is a time of festivals .
By the next few weeks, festivals will be reflected throughout the country.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps this saying is not just a word, for all of us, an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
In some houses, sweets are spoiled, while in some houses, children are drunk for sweets.
This is the darkness under the Diva.
The real pleasure of these festivals is when this darkness is reduced, this darkness spreads.
We also share happiness where there is no shortage and it becomes our nature.
You can also imagine to give one moment to another if there is delivery of sweets, clothes and gifts in our houses.
At least, the things that we don't use in our homes, share such things in others.
In many cities, start-ups of young friends of many NGs work like this.
They collectively discover the needy from the households of the people, sweets, sweets, fodders, and reach them.
Can this time, with full awareness and determination in this festival, eradicate darkness under this diva
Smiles on the face of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals and your face will be shiny.
Your lamp will be illuminated and your lamp will be illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi ji comes home in the form of luck and prosperity in Diwali.
Welcome to Lakshmi Ji in a traditional form.
Can we keep the programmes of honor in our society, in villages, in cities and in the country
Can you keep public programmes
There will be a number of labourers amongst us who have been brightening the name of the family, the society and the country with their hard work and perseverance.
Can we commemorate the pride of this laxmi of India on Diwali
There will be many daughters and daughters around us who have been doing extraordinary work.
Somebody would have been working to teach the poor children, somebody would have been engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, somebody would have been serving society by becoming a doctor and an engineer.
Being a lawyer, he would have been trying to justify anyone.
Our society recognises, respects and takes pride in them.
The programmes of their honor will be held across the country.
The promotion of India's Lakshmi means to guide the prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that one of the greatest benefits of Mann Ki Baat is that I am fortunate to interact directly with many unknown people.
I am from Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when the result of my exams came, some people asked me whether they read the Exam Warriors book
I didn't read this book.
But after coming back I read this book and read it two-three times.
My experience was very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before exam then I would have got a lot of benefit.
My little student friend, thank you for writing this letter first.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
You have said that if I can take time for innovation, I will definitely try to write something for my parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to tell me your experiences about the aspects related to stress-free examination.
So I will wait for your thoughts.
I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to our young friend, student Ali Anna Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you people also know about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through TV and also discuss the busyness.
But you know that I am also a common man like you.
I am an ordinary citizen and therefore whatever affects my mind in a normal life is also affected because I am also coming from amongst you .
Just a short while ago, he had visited the finals once the winner of the Grand Slam and the legend of the Tennis, Rafael Nadal.
The audience present there welcomed his remarks.
Even after the defeat in the difficult challenges, he praised his rival canal and gave the lives of the sportsperson.
However, on the other hand, the winners also appreciated Daniel's sports.
Both the vision and humility of the winners were worth seeing in the same match.
If you have not heard the description of the Daniel Medicave, then I will tell you all, especially the youngsters that look at this video.
The ideals of our ancestors are very commendable.
We are said in the scriptures: i.e. when a person gets absorbed with talent and humility, then who can not live his heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I am doing the things I am going to do for your good.
The debate continues, the party continues, but if some things are stopped before growing, then it is very beneficial.
It is very difficult to stop those things which increase a lot and spread a lot later.
But if we wake up in the beginning and stop it then a lot can be saved.
My heart says that with this feeling, I will talk to the young friends, especially today.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to lose its addiction .
The risk of diseases like cancer , diabetes and blood pressure increases to those who consume tobacco .
Everyone says this.
The intoxication of tobacco is because of nicotine present in it .
Its consumption in adolescence also affects the development of the brain .
But today I want to talk to you on a new topic.
You must be aware that recently e-cigarettes have been banned in India.
E-cigarettes are different from ordinary cigarettes.
In e-cigarettes, a kind of chemical smoke is produced by heating nicotine liquid substances, through which nicotine is consumed.
We understand the risk of ordinary cigarettes very well, but a false belief has been created about e-security.
There is a misunderstanding that there is no danger from e-security.
Like the rest of the cigarettes, the smelling chemicals were obtained from it.
We have seen that even if there is a father-in-law smoker in the house, he stops smoking the rest of the house and wants that his children do not have the habit of cigarettes.
There is such an attempt that no member of the family smokes, do not smoke.
He knows that smoking causes heavy losses to the body.
Pinars also know and seekers.
But the e-cigarettes are very different.
There is no such awareness among people about e-security.
He is also very unaware of the danger and because of this, sometimes e-cigarettes are quietly entering the house and sometimes showing miracles and even showing children to each other.
See, I smoke from my mouth, see, without hurt, without shouting, I am smoking.
Once the youngsters and youngsters of the house get stuck in their clutches, they gradually become addicted to this intoxication.
In fact, e-cigarettes have many harmful chemicals which have adverse effect on health.
You know that when someone smokes around us then we know that it is smelling .
Even if there is a cigarette packet in his khissa then one gets to know from the smell.
But there is no such thing with e-security. In such a situation, many youngsters and youngsters are unknowingly looking forward to taking their books in their offices, sometimes in their laughter, sometimes in their own hands and sometimes they become victims of it.
Young generation is the future of the country.
E-security has been banned so that this new method of intoxication does not disturb our young country.
Don't wear the dreams of every family, the lives of children will not be ruined.
This disease does not allow the roots to be deposited in the society.
I urge you to leave the smoking of tobacco and do not make any mistakes about e-cigarettes.
Let us together build a healthy India.
All this has to be avoided for fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great privilege for all of us that our India has been the land and land of an extraordinary people who have dedicated their entire life for the betterment of others.
This is our mother India, this is our country.
Several human beings come out of this land.
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people.
And these are those who have dedicated themselves not for themselves, but for others.
Similarly, a great destination is being honoured in Vetican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that POP Francis will promulgate the Morium Treasury on 13th October.
The work done by Sister Morium Treasis for the betterment of humanity in his young age of 50 years is an example for the entire world.
Whatever work Sister Treasy has done, it has been fulfilled with dedication and determination.
Those who are still moving forward their vision and mission.
Once again, I salute Sister Corream Treasury and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, 130 crore countrymen have resolved to get rid of single use plastic.
In the direction of environmental protection, the kind of leadership that India has led in the entire world, the eyes of all the countries are on India today.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the campaign to get rid of the single use plastic on October 2.
The people of Technical region are contributing to this campaign as their own.
But a young man from our country has launched a very unique campaign.
When I noticed this thing, I talked to them on the phone and tried to understand this new experiment.
Maybe these things will also be useful to other people of the country.
Shriman Riputan Belvi Ji is making a great effort.
When I heard the word plugging for the first time, it was also new to me.
Perhaps those words have been used in some quantity abroad.
But in India, Ripudaman Belviji has made it very popular.
I congratulate him and my friends, this time the sports ministry is also going to organize the Fight India Polling Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
We have heard how to do this programme and what happens in the programme with the experience of Ripudaman ji.
I am confident that if 130 crore countrymen take this step then our India will move 130 crore steps towards getting rid of single use plastic.
Ripudaman ji, once again thank you very much.
Let us move forward to transform our lives into a country.
There is a desire to remember one thing in a hurry.
However, in the next Mann Ki Baat, I would like to make it in depth but today I have been saying just before that so that you can get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that on 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We have to showcase the unity of the country on that day in thousands of villages of India, children, old people, schools, colleges.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you would go to 15 places in India.
If there are at least 15 places and that too, then make a program of staying for one night and two nights.
You see, understand and experience India.
How many varieties we have, and when the days of lunch come in this Deepawali festival, people go and therefore I would request you to visit any 15 places in India.
And how much is this improvement, where am I to you
Today, our rank is 34 and five years ago our rank was 65th, so in a way we have made huge dogs.
If we try harder, we will make our place in the world's major places in tourism till 5 years of independence.
Yes, it is also necessary to see that there is no loss of any person due to furnace etc. during Diwali days.
Whatever precaution should be taken for this, you must keep it.
There should also be happiness, happiness should also be, enthusiasm should also be there and our festivals also bring the fragrance of collectiveness and the culture of collectiveness.
Community Life provides a new strength and this is the stage of new efficiency.
Let us celebrate festivals with great enthusiasm, with new dreams and new resolves.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a short while ago, I got the opportunity to interact directly with the children of Karnataka.
The victory of the Times Judgment, Karnataka, repeatedly called on Baldi to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
And then he published some of the selected letters.
I read those letters and I felt very good.
These small children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
These children have written on several topics that Kirti Hegde of North Kannada has described the Digital India and Smart Cities Yojana and suggested that we need to change our education system.
And if we invite children to the nature then perhaps they can help us move forward in the protection of the environment.
Reda Nadaf has written from Laxmeshwar that he is the daughter of a soldier.
He said that because of the school being away, I cannot spend time with my friends, he has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
This was a good experience for me too.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On the same day, the Constituent Assembly had accepted the Constitution of India.
The constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for almost three years to build India.
And whenever we read the discussion, we are proud of what is the idea of dedicated life to the nation.
Can you imagine how hard they must have worked to build our country with diversity
And that too when the country was getting rid of the slogans of slaves.
It is our duty to create an innovative India keeping in mind the ideas of the great men.
Our constitution is very wide.
Perhaps there is no area of life, there is no such thing of nature that it has not touched.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the identity of our Constitution.
It protects the basic rights of every citizen, whether poor or vulnerable, backward or deprived, tribal and women.
And keeps their interests safe.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution.
Be it citizens or administrators should move forward in accordance with the spirit of constitution.
Seventy different committees were constituted on important issues in this Constituent Assembly.
One of the most important committees was the meeting and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, Babasaheb Ambedkar's skilled leadership is an incomplete mark in the construction of the Constitution which we feel proud of India.
He had ensured that every section of society should be welfare.
On the 6th December, on his birth anniversary, we recall him like a sustainable day and congratulate him.
Babasaheb's contribution to making the country rich and powerful is unforgettable.
On the fifteenth of December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on the gratitude.
Sardar Patel, the iron man of the country, had done an extraordinary job to build the country.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day but the terrorists attacked Mumbai on 26-11 years ago, how can the country forget it
This country can never forget their sacrifices.
Today, if terrorism is seen in every part of the world, it has become a very terrible form of every day-long event.
We have been contributing a lot in India for the last 40 years due to terrorism.
There were many people of the world who were not ready to take it seriously, but today, as the terrorists are snatching their twelve-two-two stances, every government in the world is looking at terrorism as a big challenge.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
He is going to destroy human powers.
And that is why not just India but all the humanitarian powers of the world have to defeat terrorism together.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi, are the stones of the Earth who have conveyed the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and excitement make immense efforts to dissolve our social tensions by weakening them.
And therefore, it is the demand of this period to be more aware of the humanitarian powers.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of December, we will celebrate the Navy Day-Navy Day.
Indian Navy protects and defends our beaches.
I congratulate all those associated with the ship.
You all must be aware that our civilization has been transformed on the banks of the rivers.
Whether it is Sindhi, Ganga, Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important for both economic and strategic purposes.
It is our entrance to the entire world.
This country, our land has had an unprecedented connection with the oceans.
And as we look at history, at the time of Chaulnavi-Chulannaukal, eight hundred and nine hundred years ago, was considered one of the most powerful ships.
In the expansion of the Chaul empire, it was a great part of his ships to make it the economic power of that period.
A number of liberals are found in the Sangam literature of Chaul Navy's humble and search journeys.
Very few people would know that women had been allowed on long-term warships in most of the ships in the world.
But in Chaulanakal and that too eight hundred and nine hundred years ago, women played a very important role in fighting and even in fighting women.
Chauel rulers had a rich knowledge of the construction of ships and construction of ships.
When we talk about the ship then who can forget the capability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the ship.
The beaches of Konkan, where the beaches are very important, used to come inside the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud anjira, Golden Durg etc. had either come to the beach or were surrounded by the sea.
The Maratha Navy was responsible for the protection of these forts.
There was a combination of major ships and small boats at the Maratha ship.
They were very talented to attack any enemy and to save them.
And when we talk about the Maratha ship, don't remember Kanoji Angre how it can be possible.
He delivered the Maratha ship to a new height and established a place of transportation of the Maratha ship at several places.
After Independence, our Indian Navy also showcased its character at different times.
Be it the freedom struggle of Goa or the 11th India-Pakistan war.
In May-June this year, when the flood hit Sri Lanka, three ships of our ships immediately reached there and helped the government and its people.
In the month of September, in Bangladesh, our ship INS Dhariyal also provided humanitarian assistance to Rohingya.
In the month of June, when the Government of Pappua-New Guinea sent messages to us and requested them to save fishermen from their fisheries boats, our ship helped us.
On the 21st of May, our ship had also reached INS Tricolor to support a trader ship in the West Akhara to be expelled from the chains.
Our ship has always been proud to provide healthcare to the Phase Island, to provide immediate relief and to provide humanitarian assistance to the neighboring country.
We respect the Indians, our defence forces, the landlords, the ships, the airplanes, the courage, the valour, the valour, the valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
5 crore countrymen can live the life of Sukh Chain, so they sacrifice their lives for the country.
Every year, we celebrate 7th December as the Empowered Servant Flag.
This is the day of proud and respecting the country's empowerment fighters.
I am glad that this time, the Ministry of Defence has decided to run the campaign from 1st to 7th December, reaching the citizens of the country to make people aware of the armed forces and to make people aware.
All these flags will be put on the chest throughout the week.
A movement of respect for the army will begin in the country.
On this occasion, we can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
You can possibly post the experiences of those who are associated with the armed forces in their surroundings with videos and photographs related to them.
In schools, colleges and lashkars, they can get information about the army.
Our new generation can be the best opportunity to get recognition about the army.
This celebration also provides the opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our civil servants.
The funds are spent by the Soldiers Welfare Board on their rehabilitation for the welfare of the families of the martyred soldiers and the injured soldiers.
Come on, let us do something that will enhance the morale of our armed forces.
We also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December is the World Soil Day.
I also want to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
There is an important part of the Earth - soil.
Whatever we eat is connected to this soil.
In a way, the entire grains are connected to the soil.
I am afraid of thinking that if there were no land or plants, then how would human life be possible
This is perhaps the reason why we have been aware of the importance of our land since ancient times.
On the one hand, our culture is an easy effort to live towards fields, soil, devotion and respect towards people, while on the other hand, the scientific methods of nutrition of this land are a part of our lives.
This has been important in the lives of the farmers of the country, in which the devotion towards their land and also the protection of the land in scientific manner.
I had heard about the farmers of Tohu village of Bhoranj Taluka in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Earlier, the farmers used half of the chemical fertilizers and fertilizer and this caused their land health to worsen.
The yields were decreasing and resulting in decreasing the income and the production of the land was slowly decreasing.
Some of the farmers of the village understood the seriousness of this situation and then they examined their land from time to time. He suggested to use the fertilizer, fertilizers, micro-nutrients and livestock fertilizers as they were asked to use.
You will also be surprised to hear the results that what was the result of the health of the land which the farmers got and the guidance they got.
These farmers grew three to four times a day in the season of Ravee 2016-17.
Our farmers across the country have made more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can understand their land more well and save their unfair crops.
We worship Mother Earth, but how much harms her health by chemical fertilizers like urea
It has been proved by every kind of scientific experiment that giving more than necessary urea to the mother Earth is a serious loss.
There is a need to make this mother-in-law aware once again.
Can our farmers, our soil sons and the souls of our soil determine how much urea they use today
How a change starts coming in the life of the farmer.
We all have started feeling of global warming and climate change.
There was a time when the cold had started before Diwali.
Today, the December 12 is staggering and the cold is increasing gradually.
But as the winter begins, we all feel that it is not good to get out of the queue.
But in such a season, people who are constantly awake can bring a beautiful outcome and that example is inspiring for all of us.
Tushar has done inspirational work to spread the message of cleanliness.
He explains that cleanliness does not have any age or does not have any limit.
Whether it is a small child or aged person, a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for everyone.
And for cleanliness, everybody needs to enjoy enzymes.
Our Divyang brother-in-law is committed.
We can learn something in the moment.
Today they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is the field of sports, any competition, any social initiative, or any other thing behind our disabled persons.
You all will remember that our disabled players had won four sportspersons by performing a beautiful exhibition in Rio Olympics and also made champions in the Blind T T T T Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are many types of competitions across the country.
A few days back, the 1st National Paraswimming Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young दिव्यांग brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and introduced their skills.
He also won Golden Jubilee at the 0th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was selected by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralmix competition.
32, he is one of the Para-Tranners who will be trained in the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute Bhai Jigar Thakur's passion and congratulate him.
Today, special attention is being given to the ease of use and opportunity for the disabled.
Our efforts are to ensure that every person in the country becomes empowered.
An inclusive society should be created, equally and with the spirit of wealth, the society will grow and move forward together.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Eid will inspire us all to enhance peace and harmony in the society.
Forget sadness and don't forget happiness.
I think we should propagate this.
We are trying to recall several interesting incidents of the past year in the medium of broadcasting there.
Can you contribute in this
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year
Remember such events that inspire others.
Remembering good things, the feeling of doing good will be awakened and mood will be created.
Good things give energy to do good.
And I will try to reach the countrymen in the coming Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, we will again come back to you for the next month.
There will be a lot of talk.

Chhath, celebrated after six days of Diwali, is one of the most regulated and devoted festivals in our country.
From food habits to weavers, traditional rules are followed in every aspect.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is completely associated with nature and the prayer of nature .
The sun and the water, the Mahaparva are at the centre of the worship of Chhath, the utensils and utensils made of bamboo and mud and wood are integral materials connected with its worshipping system.
The message of the rising sunset and the setting sunset in this festival of faith is full of unparalleled culture.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also included in this festival.
Before sixth, the entire house is cleaned, along with rivers, ponds, ponds, along the banks of Pokhara, i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environmental protection, disease redressal and governance.
Normally, people understand the feelings of taking something by asking for something, but in the sixth puja, there has been a special tradition of eating after the midnight of the morning.
Behind this tradition of seeking prasad, it has also been shown that it destroys egoism.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat continues to be praised and deliberations continue.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, my belief becomes strong that it has been tied up with the people of this country by a hundred percent unbreakable relationship.
Take examples of khadi and handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been advocating for handicrafts, for Khadi and what is the result of this
You might have been happy to hear that such a huge sale of khadi and handicrafts should have been made on the same store.
The sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation during Diwali has increased by about 680.
The total sale of fertilizer and handicrafts has increased by about 0 percent this year over the last year.
This shows that today, youngsters, elderly women, every adult like Khadi and handicrafts.
I can imagine how much benefit has been given to many deprived families, poor families, handlooming families.
In the lives of the poor and the poor, the handicrafts are making them a powerful instrument to empower the poor by bringing about a transformation in the lives of the poor.
This is playing a very important role in rural development.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experience of my Deepawali with the security forces and also asks them to know how our security forces are recognised.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on the Narendra Modi App, why can we arrange to reach our house to sweet security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that the sweets of our house should reach the people of the country.
Deepawali will be celebrated with a lot of joy.
Deepawali brought me a special experience this time too.
Once again, I was fortunate to celebrate the Diwali with our democratic security forces on the border.
This time, it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Deepawali with security forces in the Guarrej sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect every citizen of our security forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces protect our country by facing the difficult and odd situations on the border.
Wherever we get the opportunity, we should know the experience of our youth, we should listen to their pride.
Many of us do not know that our security forces are playing an important role not only in our borders but also in establishing peace across the globe.
Being a UN peacekeeper, he is shineing the name of India in the world.
In the past, on 24th October, the United Nations Day was celebrated across the globe.
Everyone recalls the UN's efforts to establish peace in the world, its positive role.
And we believe in the Vasudhaiva family that is, the whole world is our family.
And because of this belief, India has been demonstrating active participation in the various important initiatives of the UN since the beginning.
You must be aware that the proposal for the constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with both the words "We the PEOPLE".
India has always emphasized the equality of women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is its living standard.
The preliminary factories that were proposed were All men are born free and equal which was changed by the efforts of Indian representative Hansa Mehta and later became self-supported, All Human Beings are born free and equal.
Though this seems to be a very small change but there is a vision of a healthy idea.
There will be a lot of people from your mother who are getting this information for the first time.
More than 18 thousand Indian security forces have served in UN PECEPING Operatings.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with the UN Peace Keeping Initiatives and they are the third highest in the world.
By August 2019, Indian soldiers have served nearly 50 Operatings from one PECEPING Operating Operatings across the globe.
These operations are carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kong, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many parts of the world.
More than 20 thousand patients have been treated at the Indian Army Hospital in Kong and South Sudan and countless people have been rescued.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people there in different countries but have also won their hearts by making people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in establishing peace.
Very few people would know that India was the first country to send Female Police Unit to the United Nations Peace Mission in Liberia.
And look, this step of India has become an inspiration for the nations around the world.
And then all the countries started sending their own Women Police Unit.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not limited to peacekeeping operations, but India also works to train about 85 people of the country.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony across the globe.
Peacekeeping operations are not easy.
Our security forces have to work in remote areas.
There is a need to stay among the people.
Different situations and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to descend as per the local requirements and the atmosphere.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper and he was a brave man who was honored with Param Vir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who have made special marks in Cyprus.
At the age of 18, he was made Force Commander for Operating in Namibia and delivered his services to ensure the freedom of the country.
He also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and deliberated upon the peace processes.
India has always been conveying the message of peace, unity and harmony in the world as a peaceful messenger.
We believe that everybody lives with peace, harmony and moves forward towards building a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage has been decorated with such great people who have served humanity with a sense of selflessness.
Sister Providers, whom we call Bhagini Providers, were also among those extraordinary people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave him the title.
And the sense of sensitivity is that which is completely dedicated.
Later, he proved himself as per his name.
Yesterday was the 150th anniversary of the Sister Provider.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivadita was very sad because of the atrocities in the British Raj.
The British had not only made our country a slave but also tried to make us mentally slaves.
This work continued to showcase our culture and create a sense of inferiority amongst us.
Bhagini Nivedita ji rebuilt the glory of Indian culture.
Awakening national awareness, he worked to unite people.
He went to different countries of the world and raised voices against the propaganda of Sanatan religion and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is famous for his revolutionary poem Pudumai Penn, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It is said that his inspiration was the representative of Bhagini.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also supported the great scientist Jagadishchandra Basu.
He helped in publication and publicity of Basu's research through his writings and conferences.
This is the unique beauty of India that spirituality and science are supplementary in our culture.
Bhagini's representation and scientific Jagadishchandra Basu are a strong example of this.
In 18th century, a horrific plague occurred in Kolkata and hundreds of people died in Jotzota.
Without worrying about his health, Bhagini's privilege started the cleaning of the streets and the roads.
He was a woman who could live a comfortable life, but he was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifice, people looked at him in service work.
He shared the importance of cleanliness and service to the people through his work.
And it is written on his monument that the reposesses Sister Navedita who has given her all to India are resting here, who dedicated her to the nation.
Undoubtedly, he did the same.
Today, for this great personality, there can be no better tribute than that that every Indian is trying to walk on the path of service by taking inspiration from his life.
First of all, Childrans Day, celebrated on the birthday of our first big Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru Ji, greetings to all the children on the childhood day.
Children are the most important heroes of the creation of a New India.
Your concern is true that the diseases that used to come in the old age used to come around the last stage of life have started to appear even today in children.
Today it is very surprising when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes .
Such diseases were very fortunate in the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known by the name of lifestyle disorder .
The main reason for this kind of disease in young age is the deficiency of physical activity in our lifestyle and change in our food habits.
The society and family need to pay attention to this.
When they think of it, you see that there is no need to specify anything.
Just need to change your temperament, make it a habit.
I would like the family to consciously try to adopt the habit of going to the open field.
If possible, we can also play with the elders of the family in a very open way.
Instead of coming up in lifts of children make the habit of going stairs .
After dinner keep the whole family with the children walk a little bit .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing lifestyle disorder.
30 minutes of Yoga before going to school, see how much benefits are there.
You can also do the same thing at home and the speciality of Yoga is that it is simple, simple, smooth and therefore I am saying that any adult can easily do it.
Several studies are being done to know how effective Yoga is in controlling diabetes .
It is also being studied in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very incentives.
We should not only make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives, but also through treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has come in the field of sports.
In different sports, our sportspersons have named our country.
In Hockey, India has won the title of Asia Cup Hockey by playing a glorious game.
Our sportspersons performed excellently and made India a Asia Cup champion after ten years.
Earlier, India was a Asia Cup champion in 2003 and 2003.
My best wishes to the entire team and helpful staff on behalf of the countrymen.
After Hockey, good news has also come to India in Badminton.
Budmint Star Kidambi Shrikanth has given an excellent exhibition to celebrate the birth anniversary of the Danish Opinion in every Indian.
After the Indonesia Opinion and Australia Opinion, their third Super Cirrises Premier Finance.
I congratulate our young friend for this achievement and for enhancing the pride of India.
Friends, FIFA Under-1 World Cup was organised this month.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showcased their commitment to the field of football.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
The sportspersons were very excited.
The whole world is watching you...
Such a big match... I was stunned to see the energy, enthusiasm and feelings of all young players.
The World Cup was organised successfully and all teams performed its best.
Though India could not win the sportsperson, the young players of India won the hearts of everyone.
The whole world, including India, celebrated the Khel Festival and this entire competition was interesting and entertaining for the Football lovers.
The future of football is very bright, its signals are visible.
Once again, I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, as many people as I write about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of justifying myself with their feelings, I have to make a program of Mann Ki Baat everyday and every day I have to dedicate my heart to cleanliness.
Somebody sends photographs of the efforts of the illustrious and somewhere is the story of the collective efforts of the youngsters.
Somewhere there is an innovation about cleanliness or there is news of the changes brought about by the people of an official.
In the past, I have received a very recent report in which there is one thing about the transformation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
At the same time, a team of NGOs, called Ecological Protector Organization, conducted a campaign to clean the Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me the details of the fort before and after cleanliness.
I was stunned by seeing the photographs and whoever sees these photographs, sometimes they feel despaired by looking at the dirt around me, sometimes they feel that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled, then I will tell them that you can see their sweat, their emergence, their determination in the lively tests.
Your despair will be turned into trust.
This sacred effort of cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, collectivity and sustainability.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
Our friendly countrymen have the responsibility to keep the historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate the Ecological Protection Organization and its entire team and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate all the Guru Nanak Jayanti.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity, and described all the species as equal.
He emphasized on women empowerment and women's dignity.
Guru Nanak Dev ji travelled 28 thousand kilometers on foot and during his visit, he conveyed the message of true humanity.
He interacted with the people, showed them the path of truth, sacrifice and commitment.
He conveyed the message of equality in the society and showed this message not only through words, but also through his own deeds.
He launched a gallery to create a sense of service among the people.
The spirit of unity and equality among the people was awakened by sitting together and taking an angle.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of a meaningful life - the name of the god, work, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had also constructed Gurubani for his words.
In the coming year, we are going to celebrate the 550th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Let us move forward on the path of his message and learning.
My dear countrymen, after two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he had laid the foundation stone of modern integral India.
Today, we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great child of Mother India.
On 31st October, Smt. Indira Gandhi also left the world.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's specialty was that he used to not only give transformative ideas, but he was also expert in exploring a very complex solution to showcase it.
He was in the forefront of realizing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel drove India into a list.
He ensured that millions of Indians are brought under the aegis of a nation and a Constitution.
Their determination enabled them to cross all the hurdles.
Where there was a need for recognition, he recognised the use of force where it was needed.
He said that we cannot prevent any discrimination of caste and community, all the daughters and daughters of India, all of us should love our country and build our policy on mutual love and harmony.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring for the vision of our New India.
This is the reason why their birthday is celebrated as National Integration Day.
His contribution to the nation as an integral nation is incomplete.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the Rainfor University will be organized across the country on 31st October, which will include children, youth, women and all age groups from across the country.
My colleague is insistent that you also participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after Deepawali's holidays, with a new determination, you must have once again joined your daily life.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you.
Three years have been completed, while talking about Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani, today it is 36 Mo episodes.
And when I tell you in Mann Ki Baat, people from every corner of the country bring it to me, perhaps you can say very little but I get plenty of treasures.
Most of them are inspiring me.
Many are for improvement in the government.
Sometimes personal complaints are also there and sometimes attention is drawn towards social problems.
And I take half an hour of yours once a month but people convey their message on the third day of Mann Ki Baat.
And the result was that the government has also been able to take care of the sensitivity and the powers that have been in the far-flung society.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity to know the feelings of the common man.
And I am confident that this idea-wise will also be useful for the future, it will have a new consciousness and a new energy.
Once I had told Mann Ki Baat that we should worry about the need that we should not take it as much as we need.
But after that I saw that all the letters came from every corner of the country, many social organizations and many youngsters were already doing this.
Many people who worked on how to utilize the foodgrains that are left in the plate, came to my notice so that my heart was very happy.
And then I saw that many people came forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the selfie with a watchtower of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I spoke to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
In Jot-Jota, a big campaign was launched not only in India but also in the entire world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
This incident was a new self-confidence and a new pride in every daughter.
Every mother and father felt that I would also take Selfie along with my daughter.
Every girl started feeling that I am a Mahatma, I have any importance.
In the past, I was sitting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
When I told the people who went to the tour, you should send a photo on Incredible India wherever you go.
Millions of children from every corner of India, in a way, became immense integral to people working in the tourism sector.
I have realised how big a movement starts from smaller ones to the other.
Today, I was convinced to say all this because when I was thinking that three years have passed, many incidents of the last three years have been lost in my mind.
The country is constantly moving towards the right direction.
Every citizen of the country asks for something to do for the betterment of the society, for the betterment of the society, for the progress of the country, I have learnt from the countrymen in my three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
This is a huge capital for any country, it is a great power.
I salute the countrymen with my heart.
Whether it is a sheet or a towel or a curtain, it has been felt that the attraction of khadi has increased in the youth generation.
The sale of fertilizer has increased and this has led to direct employment in the houses of the poor.
Discount is given in Khadi from 2nd October, many are given.
Once again, I would like to appeal that we should move ahead and increase the campaign of Khadi.
We should work with that feeling that we should buy khadi and burn Diwali in the house of the poor.
The poor people of our country will get strength from this work and we should do it.
And because of the growing interest in this mine, the enthusiasm of the people working in the field of khadi has also increased in the Government of India to think about a new way.
How to bring new technology, how to enhance the productivity, how to bring solar-effective.
How to revive the old legacy that had been completely closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years.
In Varanasi Sevapur, Uttar Pradesh, Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several activities have been added.
New employment opportunities have been created to many people.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir resumed its closed training centre and there is a lot to give it to Kashmir.
Now because of the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will be able to work in modern ways and create new things and I am very happy that when the big corporate houses are present in Diwali, they have started giving food items.
People have also started giving food items as gifts to each other.
We all realize how things move forward in a simple manner.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month, we all made a resolve and we had decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti we will celebrate Swachhta across the country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our respected President ji started this work and the country was connected.
Whether it is children, old men or women, city or village, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness drive today.
And when I say that Sankalp to Siddhi, this cleanliness drive is moving towards a resolve, we are looking at it before our eyes.
Everyone accepts it, collaborates and contributes somewhere in realizing it.
This time, one thing is that we should make cleanliness somewhere, other it is that we should not be awake but if we have to make cleanliness a habit then a ideological movement is also necessary.
This time, many competitions have been organized with Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the cleanliness drive competition.
Thousands of children made pictures.
As far as cleanliness comes, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
We can see how much service can be made to our country's electronic media, our country's President Media, in the same service movement.
Just a few days back, somebody took care of me in connection with the 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
And you will be happy to know that the Srinagar Municipal Corporation has built Bird Ambassador for sanitation and when it comes to brand ambassadors, you will feel that it will be a film artist, perhaps he will be a hero in the field of sports.
Bill Dar has been engaged in sanitation since the age of 12-13 years.
The largest lake in Asia is near Srinagar where it is plastic, polythene, useed bottle, waste and cleanses it.
They also earn some of these.
Because his father died due to cancer at a very young age, but he added his life to cleanliness.
I would like to congratulate the Srinagar Municipal Corporation for their initiative towards cleanliness and their imagination of Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India wants to go to Srinagar and it is a big thing to get so much strength for cleanliness there.
And I am glad that he has not only made the bill a brand ambassador but has given a car to the bill to clean it this time and it also goes to other areas and teaches people for cleanliness, inspires them and falls back until the results are brought.
Bilal Dar is young but is a source of inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
This month of October is a month to remember many great men for us.
These dignitaries gave us direction for the 20th century and the 21st century, led us, guided us and they suffered a lot for the country.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji is the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji on 25th September.
This centenary is also the year of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji.
And what was the center of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and that was to live for the country, to do something for the country and not only for the country but to guide people through his conduct in his life.
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji and Deen Dayal ji are all such great men who have been away from the threads of power but have lived a moment with life and have been doing something or the other.
Nanaji Deshmukh had left the political life in rural areas and when we are celebrating his centenary year today, it is very natural to be respected for his rural work.
When former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji used to talk to the youth, he always talked about the rural development of Deshmukh.
He used to express his pride and he himself went to the village to see his work.
It is not good for them to remember all these great men, they recall these great men so that we get the path ahead and get the direction ahead.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely say about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel but on 31st October the run-for-Uniti Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme will be organized across the country.
In every city of the country, there should be a large number of run-for-Unity programs and this season is also enjoyable and it is also necessary to achieve iron power like Sardar Saheb.
Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also move forward the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We say very naturally - unity in diversity, India's specialty.
We respect the diversity but have we ever tried to realize this diversity
I would like to tell my countrymen of India repeatedly and especially my young generation to tell me that we are in a state of awakening.
Recognise the diversity of India, touch them and feel their fragrance.
This diversity of our country also serves as a very big school for the development of your personality.
There are vacations, days of Diwali, there is a habit of going around somewhere in our country, people become migrants and they are very natural.
But sometimes it is anxious that we do not see our country, we do not know the diversity of the country, but we have come under the influence of shock and have started enjoying foreign tourists.
If you go anywhere in the world, I don't have any restrictions, but sometimes look at your house.
The person of North India will not know what is in South India
The people of West India will not know what is in East India
Our country is full of diversity.
All these great men visited India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to know and understand India.
India tried to live within itself.
Can we try to learn and understand different states, different communities, groups, their customs, their traditions, their clothing, their food and their recognition as a student
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we visit not only as a student but also as a student.
I am confident that I would have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India.
There will be more than four and a half districts where I have got the opportunity to dinner and today, when I am taking care of this responsibility in India, I am very much enjoying this tour.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
You are also instructing me to reflect the storage of inadequate strength of our vast India while speaking the message of unity in diversity.
The dream of 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat' is also included in this.
There is a variety of food.
Even if you keep eating a different diet everyday, there will never be any recurrence of any diet.
This is the great strength of our tourism.
Inspire the diversity of the people of Kotikoti.
This experience will make your life prosperous.
The scope of your thinking will enhance.
And who can be a teacher bigger than experience
Generally the period from October to March is mostly of tourism .
People travel.
I am confident that even if you go this time, you will move ahead with my campaign.
Wherever you go, share your experiences and share your experiences.
You must send your photos on Incredible India (Her Tag Incredible India).
If you want to meet the people of the buildings, then also send photographs of them.
Not only of natural beauty but also of the people there.
Write good arrangements for your journey.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about that
You see, if all the people of one state say this thing then I will tell the government to fulfil it and create a publicity literature on the seven common things that have come about every state.
I mean, in a way, it is my objective to enhance the tourist destinations with the meaning of people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also play an important role in enhancing tourism in the country from the month of October to the month of March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, many things touch me as a human being.
It embraces my heart.
They leave deep impact on my mind.
At the end, I am also a man like you.
We have seen a unique example of women's power and patriotism.
We can imagine how will their mental condition be when the world has grown in this young age .
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfill the dreams of his wife.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey's husband, Makesh Dubey, worked as a hero in the army and he was martyred for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided in her mind and she also joined the army.
It is very natural for every countrymen to be proud of our mother-in-law and our brave men.
I congratulate these two sisters with my heart.
He has created a new inspiration for the Koti-Koti people of the country.
Congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri and Deepawali is also a great opportunity for the young generation of our country.
We are organizing the World Cup of FIFA Under-1.
I am confident that football will be dissolved all around.
The juice of each generation will increase in football.
There should not be any school, college field in India where our youngsters are not seen playing games.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when the whole world is playing on the soil of India.
My dear countrymen, Navaratri is being celebrated.
There is an opportunity to worship Mother Durga.
The entire environment is covered with sacred fragrance.
There is an atmosphere of spirituality all around, the atmosphere of festivals, the atmosphere of devotion and this festival is celebrated as the festival of energy.
It is known as Sharia Navaratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navaratri, I extend my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to the mother Shakti that our country will achieve new heights to fulfill the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country has the power to face every challenge.
75 years of Indias independence in two thousand twenties (2022) are going on at a rapid pace and we have come out by making a five-year road map to realise the resolve that the dreams of those people who have been dreaming of freedom should be fulfilled.
Best wishes to all of you.
Festivals and enthusiasm should also be increased.
Mann Ki August, 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when violence comes to know from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi. It is the country of Sardar Patel that has full power for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have accepted equal respect for public life values and non-violence.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening to it since we have heard it.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not take place in the name of faith, whether it is communal belief, whether it is faith in political ideology, whether it is faith in the person or the tradition.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us all kinds of arrangements to get justice in the Constitution.
I would like to assure the people of the country that nobody who lived in Daman for the sake of violence, whether it is a person or a group or a government will never bear it.
Everyone has to bow before the law, the law will determine the responsibility and will continue to punish the guilty.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to eating, drinking, living and clothing.
We see diversity in every aspect of life.
Our festivals are also filled with diversity and because of our thousands of years old cultural heritage, we need cultural traditions, social traditions and historical traditions, we will hardly survive for 365 days, which we are not associated with any festival.
Now it has also been mentioned that every festival of ours continues according to the timelines of nature.
There is a direct connection with nature.
Our rich festivals are directly associated with the farmers and are associated with fishermen.
Today, if I talk about the festivals then first of all I want to call you Michami Dukkam.
Yesterday the festival of Sanatsar was celebrated in the Jain community.
Parushan Parv is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava in Jain society.
The last day of Parushan Parva is the festival of Samvatsar.
This is indeed a wonderful tradition.
The festival of Sansatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, aspiration and friendship.
This is also known as a Parv of Forgiveness and this day there is a tradition of calling each other Michami Dukkam.
In his play The Mercant of Venice, he has written that: "Mercy is twice blessed, it blessed him that gives and him that tasks, that is, forgiveness and forgiveness, both get the blessings of God.
Bal Gangadhar had given birth to this tradition 125 years ago, and he became a symbol of the freedom movement 125 years ago.
And after independence, he became a symbol of social and education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi takes place for 10 days.
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and pride.
Greetings on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
Today, the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival gives messages of love and harmony to society and creates new hopes and new hopes in the minds of the people.
And now these festivals are also becoming the reason for tourism attraction.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that as the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think of what we can do in this direction.
A few days later, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to every countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-Juhan.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and belief for us, but we have to make festivals in New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are associated with family life.
Festivals are a matter of readiness, cleanliness.
This is not a new thing for us but it is also necessary to become a social nature.
Cleanliness should be inspired not only in the house but also in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country, with these festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of modernization are changing.
Recently, a new dimension, a new perameter, how many cultures you are, how modern you are, how much forward your thought process is, it is also being done to know and how much aware you are about the environment.
If it is against it, then it is considered bad in society today.
And today I am seeing the result of this that even during the Ganesha festival, Eco-Friendly Ganesh, as if a big campaign has emerged.
If you go to YouTube and see that every household is being built by the children, by bringing the soil and creating Ganesh Ji.
Various types of experiments are being done in every family.
In a way, such a comprehensive training of Invironment Council has been found in this festival that has been fortunately ever seen.
Media Houses are also training and guiding people in large numbers for the statues of eco-friendly Ganesha.
And as I said, our country is full of crores of bright minds.
And it feels very good when some new innovatives come to know.
Someone told me that there is a man who is an engineer himself, he gathers a special kind of soil and communicates it and gives training to the people to make Ganesh Ji.
When Ganesh is immersed in water, he takes water in a doll so that he melts immediately in the water.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will be completed on 2nd October.
And its positive results are visible.
The coverage of toilets has reached 3 to 6.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from defecation in the garbage.
A few days back, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water was reduced after the flood situation, so much dirt spread everywhere.
At present, the workers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hindi in Dhanera of Banaskantha district of Gujarat have cleaned the phase of 22 affected temples and 3 mosques.
Everyone got out of his sweat .
Each worker of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind has given such example of inspiration for cleanliness.
If the effort made by dedication to cleanliness becomes our permanent nature then where can our country reach
Wherever you get the opportunity, we find the opportunity.
But we all are connected.
Work together on the day of lunch or on Sunday .
Go to the settlement of the neighborhood, go to the nearby villages but do it as an invitation.
A statement has been made in which after the construction of toilets, you can enter your name and the name of the family which has helped it.
My friends of social media can run a constructive campaign and the work discussed in the Virtual World can be an inspiration that is respected on the ground.
This campaign of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is a competition for you, a competition for making short films, a competition for paintings is being organized.
You can write in different languages and there is no limitation of age, no age-limit.
You can make a tiny film and make your mobile phone.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language, it can also be silent.
Those who participate in this competition and those who get the best three will be awarded three on the digital level, they will be awarded three on the state level.
So let me invite everyone to join you in this campaign of cleanliness.
Once again, I would like to say that this time, on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti should be celebrated as 2nd October and for that, from 15th September, the same service mantra should be delivered to the house.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Become participants in it by working yourself.
You can see how Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after this 15-day cleaning campaign, after the same service, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on October 2nd, how would it be a sacred pleasure inside us to pay homage to the devotee Bapu
My dear countrymen, I specially ask you to accept your loans.
I would like to express my gratitude to you from the depths of the heart, that is why you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for so long, but I would like to express my gratitude because MNKBAT is not connected with this programme to millions of people from all corners of the country.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people write to me sometimes, sometimes send messages and sometimes messages come on the phone, which is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the people of the country.
I would like to wait for your messages more than you see Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes things become such a part of our habit that we do not feel that we are doing wrong.
Prime Minister, I am dedicated to Pune.
I want to tell you about a sakhi.
He always tries to help people, but I am worried about one of his habits.
I once went to Mall to shop with him.
For a sari, he spent 200 rupees easily and the auto-rickshaw that he had taken for Pitja for 450 rupees, and to go to Maul, he has been working for a long time with the rickshaw puller for five rupees.
While returning, buy vegetables from the road and save four-five rupees by rubbing each vegetable again.
I felt very bad.
We pay huge bills once without asking, and fight with the brothers and sisters who live by doing their job for a few rupees.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, a ferry planter, a small shopkeeper or a vegetable seller or a auto-rickshaw driver, whenever we come in contact with the people living in a hard work, we start feelings with them.
And whenever we go to dinner in a big restaurant, we don't even see what we have written in the bill and we can get the money out immediately.
Not only that, if you want to buy saris in the shaw room, you don't feel emotional, but we cannot stay without emotionalizing with any poor.
What will happen in the minds of the poor
The question is not Rs. 2-55, his heart feels sad that you are poor, so he doubted his honesty.
There is no difference in your life from two-five rupees but this small habit of yours would have been hurting deeply on her mind .
Madam, I am grateful to you, you have given me a message by calling a phone call that touches your heart.
I am confident that even my countrymen will have their habit of dealing with the poor.
My dear young friends, the whole country celebrates the 2nd August as National Sports Day.
This day is the birthday of the great Hockey Player and Hockey magician Major Dhyanchand Ji.
His contribution to hockey is unparalleled.
I am reminded of this because I want the new generation of our country to join sports.
Sports is part of our lives.
If we are counted among the young nations of the world, then we should also see this youth in the field of sports.
Sports i . . physical fitness , mental alternates , personality enhancing , I understand what more needed than this .
In a way, sports is a very big medicinal herb of heart attack.
And today in the Computer era, I also want to warn that the plaining field is more important than that of that place.
Play FIFA on the Computer but in the outer field also sometimes talk with the football.
If you want to play cricket on the computer, then the enjoyment of playing cricket below the sky in the open field is somewhat different.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out, the mother used to ask for the first time.
Today, the situation is such that when the children come home, cartoons start watching films in a corner or they stick to the mobile game and then the mother has to say that when will you go out
It was also a time when the mother used to tell the child when you came and today the situation is that the mother has to say that, son, when will you go out
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has prepared a Sports Talent Circle Portal to explore and monitor the talents of the sports talent, where any child who has achieved some achievements in the sports sector across the country can upload his biodeta or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to the selected innovative players.
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world with this festival of sports and sports.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share with the countrymen because of my touched event last week.
I got the opportunity to meet a few daughters of a very young age and some of these daughters are born in the Himalayas.
The courage and enthusiasm of the six daughters of our country who have never been associated with the sea, who work in the Navy, inspire us all.
These six daughters will have to cross the sea by taking a small boat INS Tarini.
The name of this campaign is Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will travel across the globe and travel to India after several months.
Sometimes it will spend 40-40 days simultaneously and sometimes it will spend 30-30 days in water.
Our six daughters and our first incident in the world are going to take place with courage among the waves of the sea.
Is it a Hindustani who is not proud of our daughters
I salute the enthusiasm of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also arrange a separate system for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read every one at that time, because this is a brave story, a self-reliant story and I will be happy to deliver the words of the daughters to you.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we celebrate all the teaching days.
Former President of our country Dr.
Radhakrishnan Ji is his birthday.
He was the President but used to present himself as an academic.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was devoted to education.
The great scientist, Albert Institute, said, "It is the supportart of the teacher to walk in the creative experiment and knowledge.
That is, awakening the joy of creative emotions and knowledge amongst our students is the most important quality of a teacher.
This time when we celebrate the Teacher's Day, can we all resolve together
And when we talk of transformation in our country, just as we remember mother in the family, the teacher in the society recalls.
Teachers play a very important role in transformation.
There have been several such incidents in every teacher's life that their simple efforts would have been successful in bringing about changes in the lives of someone.
If we make a collective effort then we will play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come let us take this mantra to Teach to Transform.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is Dr.
Annya Awasthi.
I live in Mumbai city and work for the Indian Research Centre at Howard University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the Financial Inclusion has been a matter of discussion not only in India but in the entire world.
On 28th August, 2014, he inaugurated the campaign with a dream in his mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJJDY) is scheduled to be held on 28th August, 2018.
30 crore new families have been connected with it and the bank accounts have been opened.
This figure increases even more than many countries of the world.
Today, I am very satisfying that within three years, my poor brother, who is sitting on the last edge of the society, has become part of the origin of the economy of the country, his habits have changed, he has started ignoring the bank, he has started saving the money, he has been feeling the protection of the money.
About 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
In a way, it is the survival of the poor and their strength is in the days to come.
And those whose accounts have been opened with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also benefited from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, a Rs.
In many families, because of the insurance of one rupee, when the poor suffered, the life of the family was over, they got two lakh rupees in a few days.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-Up Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana-Whether it is tribal or women, whether it is young, whether it is young, whether it is intended to do something on its own, crores of young people have got the money from the banks without any guarantee and they themselves have been reinforced.
Not only that, everybody has made a successful effort to provide jobs to each other.
Just a few days back, the people of the bank had met me, because of Jan Dhan Yojana, because of the insurance, the benefits of the common people due to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, they have served and many inspiring issues have come up.
Today, there is no such time but I will tell the people of the bank that such cases are MyGov.
He can also inspire a new generation by introducing such people.
The changes in weather cycle and environment have a very negative effect.
In the past few days, some areas of India, particularly Assam, Ishaan, India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have faced natural calamities for a long time.
Such floods are completely monitoring the affected areas.
Relief is being done at a wider level.
As far as possible, my colleagues of the cabinet are also reaching Rubru.
The State Governments are also making immense efforts to help the flood victims.
Social organizations, cultural organisations and civil servants are also making every effort to help people in such a situation.
Whether it is from the Government of India to go to the air force, the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) or the paramilitary team, everyone joins the heart and people in serving the injured.
Due to floods, life becomes very distraught.
NDRF teams have been deployed.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering on the occasion.
Self-employment has been prepared and it has been learned to work in a distraught situation by raising a public body.
Gradually, we also make such a nature that we maintain our activities according to the environment, so that we can prevent losses.
Whenever I prepare for myself, I see that more people of the country prepare for myself.
This time there have been so many letters related to GST, so many phone calls have come.
And even today, people are happy about GST, and the curiosity is also expressed.
And I also listen to you a phone call. Namaskar, Prime Minister, I call Netu Garg from Gurgaon.
I have heard the message of your Chartered Accountants Day and have been very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax-GST was started in our country last month.
Can you say that the results of the government's expectations are being achieved after a month or not
I want to know your thoughts about this.
And when a poor man writes to me, I am very happy that the GST has reduced the prices of the poor and the things that have been cheaper, then I am very happy.
Now I was watching the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the income of trucks has increased.
There is a lot of time for cutting the gap.
The highways are free from traffic jams.
Earlier, due to different taxation, most of the resources of the Transport and Logistics sector used to be used to maintain their papers and they had to make their new godowns in every state.
But GST, which I call Good and Simplicate Tax.
He has actually had a very positive impact on our economy and has had an impact in a short time.
The rapid transformation that has come into force, the rapid transformation that has taken place in each other has created a new faith in the entire country.
And sometimes, sometimes, the economists, managing experts, technologists, and the use of GST of India will be presented in the form of a model to the world.
It will be a case study for many universities in the world.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre unanimously.
And the result of this is that every government has the same priority that GST does not cause any burden on the poor.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the ministries, all departments, employees of the Central and State Governments in this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new culture of administration.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again, I congratulate crores of people for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
We have been listening to this thing since childhood and the reason for this is that 1st August, 120, an unsuccessful movement started.
On August 142, the uit India Movement was launched, which is known as August Cranti.
And on 15th August, 14th, the country became independent.
In the month of August, several incidents related to freedom struggle have been particularly linked.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people know that Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali had given the slogan of leaflets to India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 142.
The way the people of the country have been associated with you from 185 to 142, they have been struggling and tolerating, they are our inspiration for the creation of India.
The uit India Movement was an important federation of Indias Independence Movement.
This movement was resolved to liberate the entire country from British rule.
This was the time when the Indian democracy had become a part of the uit India movement by combining the corner of the country, the village, the city, the city, the trained, the abode, the poor, the Amir, everybody's congression.
Jan Akrosh was at its peak.
On the auspicious occasion of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were shouting their lives in war with the mantra of Death.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and had sacrificed their books.
We had come out listening to the bugle of freedom.
Mahatma Gandhi called for the uit India Movement, but all the big leaders were arrested by the British authorities in the jail.
And that period was that great men like Dr. Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan had played an important role in the country as the leader of the second generation.
There are two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in the Non-Accountant Movement and the uit India Movement.
The outlines of non-cooperation movement were different and the situation of 42 was so different, the rapidity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of the dead.
This entire success was the backdrop of democracy, democracy.
There was a democracy, a democracy, the whole country was fighting as one.
Sometimes I think that if we look at the leaves of history, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1985.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1985, continued in some corner of the country till 142.
This long period has created a glimpse of freedom in the hearts of the people of the country.
Everyone has been forced to do something.
Peninsula changed but there was no dearth of concept.
The country has been trying hard to break the British Sultanate.
From 185 to 142, the movement was created a situation that in 1942, it reached the peak and the thunderstorm of India's swearing-in that in five years, the British had to move in 14.
5 years from 142 to 14 years of age, from 185 to 142 years of independence, became such a people who were determined to make the country free with success in the form of a five-decisive year of achievement.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to link you with this count.
We were free in 14, today is 2019.
Nearly 0 years have passed, everybody tried to get rid of the problems faced by the governments, the systems, the systems, the changes, the development, the development, the country.
Similarly, with the determination of 142 to 14, it was a decisive five years of achievement.
I am seeing that from 2019 to 2022, a more five-year period has come to us with determination.
We will celebrate this 15th August of 2019 as a sympathetic festival and when it comes to 5 years of independence in 2022, we will continue to transform this resolve into achieving it.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolves.
Similarly, five years from 142 to 14 have become decisive for the country's independence and these five years can be decisive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
After five years, we will celebrate 5 years of our freedom.
Let us take a great initiative to achieve this from August to August.
Every Indian, social institutions, local units, schools, colleges, different organizations - take some pledge for each New India.
A resolution that we will showcase in the coming five years.
Today, I am specially online World because we are somewhere or not, but online must have been.
I invite the online world and especially my young friends and my young friends to come forward innovatively to contribute towards the creation of a New India.
Using technology, the video, the post, the blog, the analysis, the ideas and ideas, bring about everything.
Conversion this zeal into a mass movement.
Shri Narendra Modi will also launch uit India uiz for young friends on the App.
This quiz is an attempt to connect young people with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the fighters of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must propagate it, spread it.
There is no one who says that the voice of a hundred and fifty crore countrymen from the Red Fort rings.
This time too, I invite you to send your thoughts on the MY GOV or on the Narendra Modi App.
I myself read it and try to showcase it as much time as I have on August 15.
On the last three occasions, I had heard a complaint in my 15 August speech that my speech would be a little longer.
We see whether success is achieved or not.
Friends, I also want to say one thing.
There is a social economy in Indias economy.
And we should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just enjoying opportunities.
Our festivals and festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
But with this, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poor and the poor.
Just a few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then the Ganesh Festival, then the fourth moon, then Anant Chaudash, Durga Puja, Deepawali, one after another, this is the right time when the poor get the opportunity to get the opportunity of economic gain.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before the Raksha Bandhan, hundreds of households start making lathis in small household industries.
Thousands of thousands of crores of rupees are associated with a festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters goes through it.
We illuminate Deepawali, it is not just the light festival but it is just the festival, it is not the decoration of the house.
Its straight connection is with the poor families while creating small muds of soil.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment.
I have seen, and sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware than me, they are more active.
For the last one month, the people who have been aware of the environment have written letters to me.
He has urged you to tell eco-friendly Ganesha in Ganesh Chaturthi so that people are already planning to select the soil ganesh.
First of all, I express my gratitude to such people.
He has urged me to speak on this subject prematurely.
This time, the public Ganesh festival has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji inaugurated this great tradition and this year is the 125th year of the Republic of Ganesha.
We once again recall the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak in this year's Ganesha Festival.
And in the direction of Tilak ji's feelings, how should we take the public Ganesh Festival in that direction, how to strengthen this feeling and as well as to the eco-friendly Ganesha, the soil-produced Ganesh to protect the environment.
And this time I have said very soon
I am confident that you all will connect with me and benefit from this will be that those poor artisans who are poor artists who make idols will get jobs and the poor will get their stomach.
Let us link our festivals with the poor, the economy of the poor, the enjoyment of our festivals becomes the economic festival of the poor, the economic joy of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly looking at the field of education, economic sector, social sector, sports, our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, gaining new heights.
We are proud of our daughters.
Recently, our daughters performed a glorious exhibition in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to them, but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win it.
He had pressure on his face too and stress.
We have seen many such sportspersons that if the players of India fail in this, then the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people say something like this by breaking the limits and writing something that causes a lot of pain.
But for the first time when our daughters could not succeed in the World Cup, 125 crore countrymen took the defeat in their pillars.
Not only that, the glory that these daughters have done, they have glorified.
In fact, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, is doing a lot to illuminate the name of the country.
Once again, I congratulate the young generation of the country, especially our daughters.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the August Cranti, once again I recall the August 15th August, once again I recall the 5th anniversary of Independence 2022.
Every countrymen should make a five-year roadmap to ensure that every countrymen can fulfil their commitment.
We all have to take this country to new heights.
Let us come together and do something or the other.
The future of the country will continue to be better and move ahead with this belief.
Many greetings.
The weather is changing.
The weather has become pleasant in many parts of the country.
After the rains there is a feeling of relief from the heat that has fallen in the cold winds in the past.
And we have seen that there are many problems in life, however stress, personal life, public life, the arrival of rain changes our mindset.
Today, the chariot journey of Lord Jagannath is celebrated in many parts of the country with great respect and regret.
Now in some parts of the world, the festival of Lord Jagannath ji's Rath Yatra is celebrated.
And the poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath.
Those who are Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar had studied, he would have seen that he praised the temple and his traditions of Lord Jagannath, because he was under social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath ji is the god of the poor.
And very few people know that there is a word in English language, Juggernaut and that means such a magnificent chariot which no one can stop.
And in the digital sense of this Jagran, it is also seen that this word has emerged along with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath ji, I salute every countrymen and salute Lord Jagannath ji in his greetings.
The diversity of India is also its speciality, the diversity of India which is also the strength of India.
The sacred month of Ramzan was celebrated with a sacred feeling.
Now it is the festival of Id.
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my best wishes to everyone on behalf of me.
The month of Ramadan is the month of purity.
It is a month to share happiness and as much happiness as we share.
Let us share the treasure of happiness and move the country forward by taking inspiration from these sacred festivals.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, an inspirational event of the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in small villages, and in a way more wealth is from the brothers and sisters of our Muslim families.
In this sports, the people of the village have decided to build toilets together.
And within this individual toilet, it is also helped by the government and about one lakh rupees have been given to them.
One lakh rupees will be spent for other facilities of your village.
I congratulate every villager of Mubarakpur for transforming this sacred occasion of Ramadan into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
One thing is also very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that he has freed Mubarakpur from open defecation.
We know that three states in our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala which have already been declared open defecation free.
This week Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration, governance and people of these five states for completing this work.
Many of us know that if we have to do something better in the life of the person and in the life of the society then we have to work hard.
If our letters are bad, if they have to improve then they have to make efforts to stay awake for a long time.
Then the habit of mind and body changes.
The subject of cleanliness is similar.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We have to constantly try to get rid of it.
Everyone has to attract attention.
We have to remember the best inspirational events.
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the past, a very best incident came in my mind, which I would like to say before you.
The event is from Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration has taken a big task from the people's participation.
100 hours of Non-Stop Expedition.
And what was the goal
10 thousand household toilets have been constructed in 1 gram panchayats within a hundred hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and the government have successfully completed the task of constructing ten thousand toilets in 100 hours together.
1 villages have become ODF.
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district that the efforts given by them have brought a very inspirational example.
During these days, in Mann Ki Baat, I keep getting deliberations from the people and Narendra Modi keeps on coming to the app, MyGov.
It keeps coming on in, it keeps coming from letters, it keeps on coming on the sky.
Shri Mann Prakash Tripathy has recalled the fact that on 25th June, he has presented it as a dark era in the history of democracy.
This awareness about the democracy of Prakash Tripathy ji is praiseworthy and democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
15, 25 June - It was a dark night that no democracy lover could forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into a prison.
The opponent voice was pressed.
The leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were shut down in jail.
The system of justice could not be saved from the shadow of that terrible form of bitterness.
The newspapers were completely bankrupt.
Todays journalists, students of the world, people working in the democratic system, reminding them of the period of time, constantly and constantly trying to raise awareness about democracy and continue to do so.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
Atal ji had written a poem when it took one year to Katokti and he described the mindset of that period in his poem.
We have to further strengthen this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud by raising his head in the world.
On 21st June, 2019, the entire world became Yoga-May.
From water to mountain people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga its own.
On the Great Wall of China, people had practiced Yoga in China, while people did yoga at a height of 2400 meters above the sea on the World Heritage site Machu Picchu in Peru.
In French, people performed yoga at the Film Tower.
More than 400 people performed Yoga in Abu Dhabi, UAE.
In Afghanistan, India had a new wait for India's friendship by doing Yoga on the Friendship Dam-Salma Dam in Hairat.
Programmes were held at 0 places in smaller places like Singapore and they launched the campaign for weeks.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters were organised at the UN headquarters.
The UN officials, including the princes of the world, attended...
This time again, Yoga has also worked as a World Record.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by doing yoga together.
I also got the opportunity to attend Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I was fortunate to do yoga in the rain.
Where our soldiers have minus 20, 25 and 40 degrees, they also performed yoga in Siachen.
Our Armed Forces, BSFs, ITBPs, CRPFs, CISFs, everybody has made Yoga their own partners with their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that share photos of the three generations of the family doing yoga together.
Some TV channels also moved forward.
I got several photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi app.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, I am speaking from Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Saheb, I am sure that recently we had heard in your statement in Kerala that we should give good readable books in place of gifts and gifts and flowers at different places.
You have also started this work in your tenure in Gujarat, but Saheb, we are not able to see this thing in just a few days.
So can we do this
Peakers Foundation is organised and people have the habit of reading books, people are aware of the reading day and reading month.
For this, I got the opportunity to go on the occasion of its launch.
And the handicrafts of Khadi, which also encourages Khadi.
As far as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of all of us, but after coming here, my habit was abandoned.
But when he went to Kerala, once again he remembered it.
And recently I have also started giving the following information to the government.
We can also gradually create a habit.
And the age of flowers is very low.
Once we have taken it, then we put it.
But if we give the book then it becomes a part of the household, it becomes part of the family.
If we welcome Khadi's towel then how many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure is also reduced and it is also used in a true sense.
And when I am saying this thing, how historical is the value of such things.
When I went to the US last year, the British queen in London, Rani Elizabeth, invited me to dinner.
How many years have passed, even then Rani Elizabeth has saved the towel given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was watching, I was insistent on touching them.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life and became part of his history.
I am confident that the habits do not change overnight and when we talk like this, we have to become victims of symptoms.
If we talk about it then there will also be changes in the country.
My dear countrymen, due to being the Prime Minister, there are several kinds of work.
I have to stay in the files but I have made a habit for myself that I read some of the letters that come to me every day and this gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of letters come, different kinds of people write letters.
These days I got the opportunity to read such a letter. I feel that I should tell you about it.
In a remote south, in Tamil Nadu, Aurulmoji Sarvanan, a housewife of Madurai, sent me a letter.
And in Chithi, he wrote that I thought of doing some economic activity with the support of paying attention to the education of children in my family so that the family gets financial support.
So I took money from the bank through the 'Mudra' scheme and brought some goods from the market and started a small work towards sending them to the forefront.
I am aware that the Government of India has set up a system called Sarvmant e-Marketplace.
So I discovered the information about what it is and asked the people about it.
Then I myself registered it.
I would like to tell the countrymen that even if you get the opportunity, you should also visit the EGEM on the Internet.
Those who want to send supply of something in the government, those who want to send small things, those who want to send electricity bulbs, want to send dustbins, want to send certificates, want to send tables, sell them, they can register their names in the site.
They can write and write about the quality of goods they have, how much they sell, they can write, and even if the people of the departments of the government have to visit the site, they will have to see if they are not tied up in the supply supply system, but they are cheaper.
And then they have to order.
So, every department of the government, which registers its name within the E-GEM, has to be seen.
Due to lack of middlemen, things are very cheap.
Now, the Arulmozhi Medame has registered all the goods that could be given on this website of the government.
And the funny thing is that the letter he wrote to me is very interesting.
He has written that one thing I got the money from 'Mudra', my business started, I kept all the information that I can give inside the E-GEM and what I would have been asked from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that I purchased two thermos from the Prime Minister's Office.
And I got my bill of Rs. 1600.
This is the power.
This is the strength of the country.
This includes transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-marketplace-GeM.
I would like to assure the people who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way, add more to this point.
I believe that this is a wonderful example of the Minimum Government and the Maximum Governance (MSP) and what is its goal is at least price and easier efficiency and transparentness.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the speciality of India that our footsteps are on the ground connected with Yoga, so our dreams are to overcome those aspirations far and wide.
Just a few days ago, India has done a lot of hard work in sports and science.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 new satellites with Cartosate-2 series satellites.
And this satellite includes about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, British, America, besides India.
And this satellite mission of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of agriculture, in the field of natural calamities.
Just a few days back, we all remember that ISRO had successfully launched the GST-1.
And this is the most weightful satellite in which India has so far launched satellites.
And when the newspapers of our country compared with the weight of his elephant, you can imagine how big our scientists have done in the space sector.
A thousand days have been completed in the old Mars Mission.
But I am glad that our scientists had the power to do it successfully for six months and now even after a thousand days, our Mangalyaan Mission is working.
The photographs are being sent, information is being given and the scientific data is coming, it is working more than its age.
A thousand days have been completed in our scientific journey, there is an important stop in our space journey.
We are also witnessing that the interest of our youth is increasing in the field of sports.
Now it is seen that in addition to studies, our young generation is looking at their future in sports and because of their hard work, the country's name is also illuminated due to their efforts.
Recently, India has enhanced the dignity of the country by placing its glory in the Indonesia Opinion by the Bedminton player Kedambi Srikanth.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
There was an opportunity to attend the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track for Usha School of Athletics, Usha Ji.
Sportspersons play a very important role in personality development.
The importance of sports is very big in the entire personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country.
If children are interested in sports in our family too then they should be given an opportunity to play.
They should not be taken up from the fields, shut down in the rooms, compulsory for books, even studying, can progress in it, but if they are capable of sports, they should be encouraged and encouraged by the school, college, family and nearby people.
Everyone should take a dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the atmosphere of rainy season, festivals, in a way, the feeling of this period is new.
We can never forget the heat of this year.
We are waiting for the rains.
Today, when I am talking to you, the sacred month of Ramzan has started.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my best wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community, on the auspicious occasion of this holy month.
Respect, spirituality and donation are very important in Ramzan.
We are very fortunate that our ancestors have built such a tradition that today India can proudly proud of the fact that we can proudly proud of the fact that all the communities of the world are present in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God and those who deny God also live, those who worship the idol and those who oppose the idol.
Every kind of thought, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, every kind of tradition, every kind of tradition, we have inspired the art of living together and then religion, tradition, ideology, tradition, that message gives us peace, unity and harmony.
This sacred month of sports will help in furthering this path of peace, unity and compassion.
Once again, I wish you all the best.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I used a word and especially the youngsters had asked them to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
Take new experiences and this is the age when life can be saved in such a way, a little risk can be taken and problems can be invited.
I am happy that many people have reflected me.
Everyone showed me the enthusiasm to speak to me personally.
Some people have written that we have now started writing poems.
My reading habit was almost abandoned.
Therefore, I decided to read in these holidays.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle has been taken to give India freedom, how many freedom fighters spent years in jail.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh who has done a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to your family about this.
I am happy that the young generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed for this country.
Innumerable great men who spent their lives in young age, many young people laughed and laughed at the batch of Fancy.
And that is why today we are breathing in independent India.
We must have seen one thing that the great men who spent time in the freedom movement had done a great job of writing, studying and ensuring Indias independence.
Many years ago, I had visited Andaman Nicobar.
The Cellular Jail was visited.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji had written a book 'Maji Janmath' in the jail.
He used to write poems and write on the walls.
They were shut down in a small cell.
Think of how freedom fighters will have tortured.
When I read Savarkar ji's book Maji Janmath, I got the inspiration to see Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show that is very inspiring.
There is no state of India, there is no language speaker of India who has not given birth to his youth in the Cellular Jail of Andaman for the sake of freedom and for the sake of black water.
Every language speaker, people from every region, every generation used to visit the British. Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I will definitely tell the youth of the country how the people had to face the oppressions and how much troubles we had to face for the freedom we have achieved, if we see the Cellular Jail.
When you get the opportunity, you must go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of the month is 5th June.
Together with nature means to foster a better planet.
And who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
That is, the world we don't want is our duty to worry about it, we also take care of it.
If you are very tired and open the windows of the room, open the doors, fill the fresh air in your breath then a new consciousness comes.
A new energy emerges when it comes into contact with the five Mahabhutas of the five Mahabhutas, a new consciousness in our body.
We all have done this experience but we don't recognize it. We don't connect it to a corner, a corner.
After this, you must see that when you are connected with the natural conditions, new consciousness will continue to emerge within you and therefore the global campaign to connect with nature on 5th June, we should also make our campaign.
And we are getting some benefits from our ancestors by protecting the environment.
If we protect, our future generations will be benefitted.
In Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the root cause of power.
And Athurveda is the biggest guiding scripture of the environment in a way and has been written thousands of years ago.
We are saying there: Mother Earth: The sons of Ahm Prithvia: The Vedas say that the purity that we have is due to our Earth.
The Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, then one thing is that Mahatma Buddha was born, he got the knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana was under three trees.
But we need to link it with modern words.
These days, I get news from the states.
In almost every state, a big campaign of tree plantation takes place as soon as the rains come.
Crores of trees are planted.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has become a day known for the world.
As World Yoga Day, the whole world celebrates it.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day has spread across every corner and is connecting those people.
On the one hand, when many powers of division are showing their distorted faces in the world, Yoga is the biggest gift of India to the world.
We have linked the world with Yoga in a message.
As Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, Yoga is also connecting the world today.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to the growing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live a stress-free life.
And it has been noticed that this situation is also happening in young people.
Yoga plays an important role in taking medicines and spending days in such a way that it is stress-free life.
Yoga is a guarantee for both Wellness and Fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible to experience the journey from the body, from the mind, from the thoughts, from the thoughts, through the medium of yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and all the leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year I had announced some competitions related to Yoga.
Gradually, work will progress in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga and asked me to appeal to three generations of the same family together on the third International Day of Yoga.
Whether it is a grandfather or a maternal granddaughter or a daughter or a daughter, each generation should do yoga together and upload its details.
Today and tomorrow will be a good combination and Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we had launched the Selfie with Doctor and felt a very interesting experience.
These three generations of Yoga will awaken the need for the country and the world.
I invite you to your brother.
We still have about three weeks for International Yoga Week.
Today we start doing practices.
I will continue to post something or the other on Yoga daily from June 1 to Twitter and continue to post till 21st June.
I'll share with you.
You should also spread, broadcast and connect people for three weeks continuously.
In a way this is the movement of preventive healthcare.
I invite you all to join it.
Because I had a very interesting phone call and I might not have thought of it like this.
But I am grateful for the way he caught this thing.
You will also be aware of this phone call.
Namaste Modi Ji, I am Naina, from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your guidance.
The zeal that you have raised from the valleys of Kashi has now taken the form of a movement by inspiring you.
Your point is that wherever I go, the government system works for cleanliness, but during these days the festival of cleanliness is also made in the society.
Five days before my visit, seven days ago, ten days ago, many cleanliness programs are organized.
The media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and I went to Kutch just a few days back.
You can imagine how much pleasure I would be and how the country is also taking into account these things.
During my journey, cleanliness is linked to the topic, what can be more happiness for me
Whatever other preparations have to be made for the welcome of the Prime Minister, cleanliness will be the main thing.
This is also encouraging for any cleanliness lover.
I extend my best wishes to all those who help in the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, the suggestion is to spread a little commodity.
I don't know if I can do that.
Ask the people who want to invite you before meeting Modiji now, how will the level of cleanliness be when you want to invite me
I felt very good, but I have to think.
However, it is true that the movement should be started that it would be better to provide other things in the form of gifts that we should clean up so many tons of wastes and give them in gifts.
How many people can be prevented from getting sick
How big will be the work of humanity
One thing I would like to say is that we should not consider the cotton and waste as west, it is a healthy source.
Don't look at it just as garbage.
The Government of India has decided to launch a very important campaign of West Management with the help of State Governments as well as the people of the cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, solid waste and liquid waste will be available in about 4 thousand cities of the country.
Two types of waste will be available, one green and the other blue.
Two types of wastes - one liquid waste and the other dry west.
If we stay in Good Governance, put the dry waste in the blue cattle and put the wet waste in the green cattle, like the skins of vegetables, sown food, bricks or tree leaves, it is all wet cattle and put it in green cattle.
This entire process is like that which can be used in the fields, the color of the fields is green, it will be remembered that what waste is to be put in the green cattle.
And the remaining wastes such as ruddy paper, cardboard, iron, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken dumb, rubber, dhatu and other negative things are called a kind of dry waste, which has to be recycled by putting in machines.
Just a few days back, you must have heard a news that the Versova beach, which is considered to be dirty in Mumbai, has become a beautiful clean chocolate versova beach today.
Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV).
I wish Shriman Afroz Shah.
I extend my best wishes to the movement.
And the way they connected the people of the entire region like a peoples movement and transformed them into mass movements, this is a very inspirational example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the month, for the last 15 days, for the month, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time, for the first time.
Three years ago, you had given me the responsibility of the Prime Minister.
A lot of surveys have been done and a lot of Opinion Paul has come. I see this process as a positive signal.
This 3-year period has been envisaged on every episode.
Every section of the society has reviewed it.
This is an excellent process in democracy.
I am obviously confident that the governments should be responsible in the democratic system and the people should give their account of their work.
This movement is very important for an awakening nation, for a peaceful nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, every thing has an impact on me as well as on the minds of any common citizen.
Mann Ki Baat is seen as a one-sided interaction, some people also comment on it politically, but after such a long experience, I feel that when I started Mann Ki Baat, I had not even thought that Mann Ki Baat would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems as if I sit in the house between the family and talk to the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
And as I said, I have an impact on my mind as a common man.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker, Honble Speaker, everyone inaugurated an analytical book Mann Ki Baat.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, as long as we meet now, the rains have come in every corner of the country, the weather has changed, the results of the tests have been done, the new generation will have to be inaugurated from New Year and a new happy environment will be spread.
Come, let us all move forward in this environment while enjoying nature.
My best wishes to you all on behalf of me.
Most of those people who try to reach me are those who actually do something in their lives.
He is working in accordance with his intellect, power, capabilities and circumstances, and when it comes to mind, I felt that this instruction is not common, it has emerged from the bottom of experience.
I never thought that today the youngsters in our country have been doing this thing for a long time.
Yes, we have been aware of the fact that some social institutions work for years but the youth of my country are engaged in it.
How many videos have been sent to me
There are many places where roti banks run.
People deposit roti on their behalf in this roti bank, collect vegetables and those who are needy are also getting it from there.
The beneficiaries also feel satisfaction and the beneficiaries never have to look down.
This is an example of how to work with the support of society.
Today the month of April is ending, the last day.
The first day of May is the foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
The two states have made a continuous effort to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the country.
My best wishes to both the states.
There was a time when the climate change was considered the subject of education, the subject of liberalism, but today, we feel it and express it in our daily life.
Nature has changed all the rules of sports.
The heat that takes place in our country in May-June this time in March-April, when I was receiving information about Mann Ki Baat, people have given me more information about what should be done during this summer.
However, the lions are spreading all the things, it is not new, but even then the re-sumption of that time is very useful.
Shriman Prashant Kumar Mishra and T.

Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern for birds.
These friends have said that water should be put on the roof in Balkani and I have seen that small children of the family do this work very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, then they go to see 10 times a day whether the utensils which have been kept have water or not and they also gather that birds have come or not.
We believe that this game is going on, but in reality, it is a wonderful experience to raise the feelings of condolences in the minds of the child.
Sometimes you also see, this kind of feeling with animals and birds makes you feel a new joy.
However, it is important to emphasize such efforts in a collective manner that we are coloured with animals and birds in our country.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of Dawoodi Wahra society used to take hundreds of years.
I got the opportunity to launch it.
He shared around 52 thousand birds of pulses across the world.
He also got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that printers, milk, vegetables, potatoes, anybody comes to our courtyard, but we forget that the days of summer are the days before asking them for a little water.
Young friends, I want to do some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that our young generation is enjoyed living in ASO-RAM.
Parents also recognise them in a safe condition.
I am confident that some friends will definitely try and tell me but true
If you use this time of vaccine according to my suggestions, I make three suggestions, three of them are very good, but try to implement one of the three.
Those lips or feel new.
Try to learn new skills.
If you don't see, you don't know, you don't know but if you want to go there then try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading about it in the book or listening from the acquaintances and feeling the same thing yourself, there is a gap between the ground.
I would like to urge you to know what your curiosity is in this vacation.
Be it positive, even if you are out of comfort, do it.
We are from the middle class and are from the happy family.
I don't say that do it again and again.
Whether it is the time of the evening, carrying your football or volleyball or carrying any means of sports, reach the poorest of the population.
You can enjoy yourself with those poor kids, you can see that you can never get the joy of such a game before.
And I am confident that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several NGOs continue to work for service.
You are also associated with the Gugul Guru. Any such organisation should be connected for 15 days and 20 days.
But at the same time you feel that you have made such a summer camp, if you have learned the course of personality development then you can reach those people who do not get the opportunity to attend such camps in the society and learn the money you have learned without taking.
You can learn how to develop them.
Every person has become more busy with technology.
Community is also a culture and collectiveness is a power.
Today is the age of competition.
Sometimes it is afraid that our young generation instruments are becoming human robots or not
Away from technology, efforts to spend time with you.
Some musicians are learning 5-50 words of a new language, whether Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
There is a country full of diversity and if you look at it, you can find someone learning around us.
Do you want to learn car driving, do you ever want to learn autorickshaw
You have driven the psychologists, but the three-phase cycle, which carrys people, has ever urge them to run.
You will see that all these new experiments are like this that will give you enjoyment and tied life in a wire that will also expel you.
Friends, Do something out of box.
This is an opportunity to create a life.
And you would like to think that all the examinations will be completed and when you go to the new stage of the carpet then you will not get the opportunity.
Later you will fall into other jams and therefore I would like to tell you that if you are keen to learn magic then learn the leaf magic.
Keep showing miracles to your loyalists.
I am telling my experience that the world is learned and understood by looking at which we cannot imagine.
This will help you learn a lot.
I would like and it is also true that when you are going, share the details of it.
Have you seen a new one
Where did you go
You can share your experiences using the Heshteg Incredible India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has also given you good opportunity.
There is a scheme of Government of India.
If you are downloading the Bhim App, you will also use it.
But refer to the other.
If someone else is connected and the new person makes three transactions, if the economic work is done three times then you get an amount of 10 rupees for that work.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you get it done by 20 people in a day, you will pay Rs.
Traders can also be earned, students can also be earned.
And this scheme is till 14th October.
You will contribute towards creating digital India.
You will become a guardian of New India.
So the vacation and earnings of the vacation.
He had become a symbol of the VIP culture in a way, but the experience is that the red light used to appear on the vehicle, but it was smelling in the brain and the VIP culturer was home.
Just now, the red light has gone, no one can claim that the red light that has been melted in the brain has gone out.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Well, he has expressed his apprehension in this phone but now this phone call is estimated from the time that the common man does not like these things.
This feels it to be removed.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am speaking Shiva Choubey from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I ask you something about the government's red beacon lift bun.
I read a line in Newspaper in which I was very proud to note that today my time is equally important.
I don't get stuck in traffic jam and I don't even have to stop anyone.
So I would like to thank you very much for this decision.
Our country is not being cleaned in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which has been launched, the VIP's merchandise is also being cleaned from our roads. Thanks to the government's decision to go to the Red Light.
But we have to try to get it out of mind too.
If we all try awake together then we can get out.
Our concept of New India is that the importance of EPI instead of VIP in the country increases.
And when I am calling EPI instead of VIP, my feelings are clear that every person is impart.
Everybody has the importance, everybody has the greatness.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore countrymen, then how much power will be achieved to fulfill the great dreams of the countrymen.
We have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I have always been saying that we recall our history, our cultures and our traditions.
Out of this, we get energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji.
We have become so small because of some reason that we think of it for more than a century.
Century is very important for other countries of the world.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have the opportunity to celebrate thousands of years and even more than a thousand years old memories.
How would it happen a thousand years ago
Very few people knew that Ramanujacharya ji had a very big fight against the evil that had been in the society, the feeling of untouchability, the feeling of casteism.
The society, which was considered untouchable by their conduct, had embraced them.
He invited him to enter his temple thousands of years ago and successfully entered the temple.
We are fortunate that in every age, great men are born from our society to end the evil of our society.
When we celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya, then there is strength in the organization for social unity.
The Government of India is also going to release a stamp in memory of Saint Ramanujacharya on May 1.
I salute Saint Ramanujacharya ji and pay my respects.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is also a different significance.
It is also celebrated as a labor day in many parts of the world.
If the labourers are discussed then it is very natural to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And very few people will know that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities that the workers get today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk to Baba Saheb, I speak of Saint Ramanujacharya ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of the 12th century Karnataka, Guru Basaveshwar ji.
Tomorrow I got the opportunity to go to a seminar.
This was an opportunity to dedicate the collections of his interaction.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
Today, when I talk to the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattatopant Khengdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The challenges faced by the world today, violence, war, destruction and hostility...
When we look at this environment, the ideas of Buddha are very relevant.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent reflection of Buddhas journey from war.
I am fortunate that on this great festival of Buddha Purnima, Vesak Day is celebrated by United Nations.
This year he is going to be in Sri Lanka.
On this sacred festival, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Their memories will get an opportunity to renew.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with this mantra of 'Sahu Saath-Shahu' development.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment towards South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 26th March, 2019
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you, most of the families in the country will be busy in the examination of their children.
Those whose examinations have been completed will have a slight slight atmosphere and where the examinations are going on, there will still be a little concern in those families.
But at this time I will say that once again listen to what I have done to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
During the examination, the letter will definitely be used for you.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the day of independence of Bangladesh.
A historic war against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this important day, I extend my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence and wish that Bangladesh will move forward, develop and I assure the Bangladeshis that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will continue to contribute towards peace, security and development in this entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are our joint heritage.
Bangladesh's national anthem is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in the year 2013, he was the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize and the British had given him the title of Nighthood.
Three days ago, on March 23, Bhagat Singh ji and his brother Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know the incident of March 23 - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. There was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were honoured by Mother Bharati's freedom struggle.
And these three braves are still inspiration for all of us.
We cannot even decorate the story of sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultanate was afraid of these three youths.
Fancy was tied up in the jail, but how to move ahead with it, the British were worried about it.
And then it was to be hanged on 24th March but it was handed over on 23rd March.
Fancy was supplied by a charioteer, which is not normally done.
And then the British had quietly burnt their bodies in today's Punjab.
A few years ago when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel a kind of wave on that soil.
And I would like to tell the youngsters of the country that whenever they get the opportunity, visit Punjab, visit Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Datt.
This was the time when the thunderstorm of freedom, its rapidity, its spread was increasing.
On the one hand, the brave men like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired many youths for the sacred revolution, and just a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha on 10th April 11.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
Gandhian and Gandhian style in the freedom movement of India was first seen in Champaran.
This was a major turning point in the entire movement of freedom.
In particular, in the context of the methodology of the struggle, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Satyagraha of Kheda, the rivalry of the millionaires in Ahmedabad, the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and working style was seen in this period.
In 115th, Gandhi returned from abroad and in 11th century he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot assess the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the print that Mahatma Gandhi has in our minds.
Just imagine that one person who returned to India in 2015, only two years of age.
Neither did the country know them, nor did they have any effect.
At that time we can imagine how hard they have suffered and how hard they have to work.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that Mahatma Gandhi's organisation could be able to examine the nerves of the Indian society of Kaushalya, Mahatma Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi, with his behaviour, to organize, inspire the poorest of the people in front of the British Sultanate, to bring them to the ground for the struggle.
And therefore, in this form, we feel the rumour of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Gandhi a hundred years ago, that Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who starts a public life.
We can learn from them how to start a public life, how much hard work has to be done and how Gandhi did it.
And this was the time when Gandhiji had sent Rajendra Babu and Acharya Kripalani Ji to the villages when we heard the names of the big Diggage leaders.
We had to learn the way people were working with the people to paint them with the color of freedom.
And the British cannot understand what is the practice of Gandhi
Gandhi knew that he had made a coin on two sides.
On one side of the coin, the conflict is on the other side.
On the one hand you will fill the jail and on the other hand you will homie yourself in constructive activities .
Gandhi had a very amazing balance in his work style.
What is the word Satyagrah, what can be unhappiness, what is uncooperation in such a larger sultan, Gandhiji has established a new idea not through words but through a successful experiment.
The desire for this transformation of hundreds of crores of countrymen, the efforts of this transformation, this is the same that will lay the foundation stone of a New India.
New India is neither a government program nor a political party, nor a project.
This is the feeling of how one hundred and fifty crore countrymen together want to build a magnificent India.
There is a hope in the minds of hundreds of crores of people, there is a feeling, a resolve, a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we go a little away from our lives and look at the ongoing activities in the society with a sense of sensitivity and try to know what is happening around us, we will be surprised to know that the lakhs of people are seen doing something for the society, the exploited, the deprived, the deprived, the poor and the poor.
And he also practices, practices and practices like a poet.
Many people go to the hospital everyday and help patients.
Many people who know that they are running for blood donation immediately .
There are many people who are hungry, they worry about their food.
Our country is a very large settlement.
Public service is the same Lord service, this mantra is in our blood.
Once we see it as a collective, organised, we will know how much power it is.
As it is a matter of New India, it is very natural to see it from a different perspective and it is acceptable to the democracy.
But it is true that the dream of New India-Russia Crore countrymen can be achieved in front of our eyes if hundreds of millions of people imagine, determine the path to achieve the imagination.
And it is not necessary that all things should be done from the budget only through government projects or government funds.
If every citizen conceives that I will follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen conceives that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full sensitivity and determination. If every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use petrol diesel in my life then how much change can come.
It means that every citizen follows his own civil religion, follows the duties.
This itself can be a good start of New India.
My dear countrymen, I also express my gratitude to you.
A large number of people participated in digital payments and digital movements.
Its curiosity has also increased due to how cashless transactions can be done.
The poorest person is also trying to learn and gradually people are moving towards how to do business without any investment.
Different types of digital payments have been seen after demonetisation, noattage.
When the BHIM App has been started, it has been just two-and-a-half months but about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption. Can 125 crore countrymen enjoy digital transactions in one year
We have announced in the budget.
If they want this work, they cannot wait for one year, they can do it in six months.
Two and a half thousand crore digital transactions, if we have to pay the fees, we will not fill the cash, we will fill the digital, we will have to travel in the railways, we will pay the digital payments, we will pay the medicines, we will pay the digital payments, we will run the cheap cereal shops.
We can do this in everyday life.
You are not imagined but you can serve the country with greater service and you can become a brave soldier by fighting against black money and corruption.
In the last few days, several programmes have been organised for the DGDN Festival.
There is a commitment to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
There was also an anonymous scheme.
About 125 lakh people have received this reward from the consumer.
0 thousand people have achieved the reward for traders.
And everyone has also resolved to take this step forward.
On 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be concluded.
After a hundred days of completion, a final big event will be held.
There is also a large drone in it.
I am confident that in whatever time we have saved the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we propagate the Bhim App.
We should contribute to how to reduce investment transactions and how to reduce transactions with boats.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I request a message from the people for Mann Ki Baat then every kind of suggestion comes.
But I have seen that everybody has always been insisting on cleanliness.
I want to talk to you about my heart.
I want to say that people have to understand how important cleanliness is.
I pass through a river every day in which people burst a lot of garbage and pollut the river.
This river flows from the bridge of Rispna to my house.
Many people have also spoken about it, but it has not benefitted from it.
And the best thing is that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, informing me and also telling me that he has made a lot of efforts but he has failed.
The Swachhta Abhiyan has started from Jayar.
Every person has been positively linked to it.
He has also taken the form of an invitation.
The hatred towards dirt is also increasing.
Whether it is awareness or active partnership or movement, all of them have their own importance.
But cleanliness is linked to the habits of movement.
This movement is a movement to change habits, this movement is a movement to create cleanliness habits.
This movement can happen in a collective manner.
The work is difficult but it has to be done.
I am confident that this feeling has awakened in the new generation of the country, in children, in the students and in the youth and this is a sign of a good result.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, those who are listening to Gayatri, I will tell all those countrymen that this message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, from the beginning, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one thing and most people have expressed concern over the waste of food.
We know that we take more than necessary food in the family and in the collective food processing programmes.
Whatever thing we see, we take everything in the bag and we cannot eat it.
We cannot afford half of the amount of bags that we fill up and we keep it there.
You have sometimes wondered how much damage we can do with the food we leave.
Have you ever thought that if we don't spoil the food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people.
Despite some attempts, sadness is a social treason on this subject.
Injustice to the poor.
I am not insisting on this matter, but I want to increase awareness.
Their lives inspire us not to spoil food.
We have to take as much food as we want.
See, there are such options for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep your stomach empty, keep a little plate empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally suffering from depression.
The problem is that there are people around us but we cannot recognize them and perhaps we are reluctant to speak openly on this topic.
Those who are suffering from depression do not even speak because they themselves feel embarrassed about this.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such a disease that can not get rid of it.
There is a need to create a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of the suppression of depression, it requires an expression.
Talk openly to your friends, friends, parents, brothers and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes it feels solitary and especially students living in the hospital have more problems.
Families are bigger and they stay together because of which there is no possibility of depression.
In spite of this, I want to tell my parents that you have seen that your daughter or daughter or any member of the family are sitting with everyone, and they say that I don't pay myself, then you will not come to the table.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to live in the group and lives in a single corner then keep in mind that it does not happen.
This is an excellent solution.
And depression is the reason for mental and physical diseases.
Similarly, diabetes also eliminates our sustainability, fighting, adventure and decision making capabilities.
Your friends, your family, your premises and your monasteries can stop you from going into depression and if you have gone then you can get out of it quickly.
Help with your heart, share their happiness and grief, you will feel that the pain inside you will end.
If you try to understand their sufferings and work with service, then a new self-confidence will be born within you.
By connecting with other people, by serving someone and by serving freely, your heart will be lightened.
However, Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in getting rid of stress, getting rid of stress and making efforts towards happiness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga and this is the third year.
You all make preparations and celebrate Yoga Festivals in millions of people.
If you have any information about the third International Yoga Day then send me through the mobile application.
Whatever songs and poetic compositions can be made about Yoga, it should be prepared so that it can be easily understood by the people.
But along with work, women have special responsibilities.
He also holds family responsibilities and also collaborates in family economic responsibilities, which often causes injustice to his newborn.
The Government of India has then taken a very important decision that these nokhariat women have been increased to 26 weeks at the time of their delivery, the Meternity Level or the previous 12 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us.
If this happens then these children will grow up and become invaluable in the country.
It will also save the health of mothers and it will be an important decision.
This will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
The life of all these great men continues to inspire us and can fulfil the resolve of a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nine Sanvatsar are greetings to all of you for this new year.
This is the best time for the farmers to get their hard work after the spring season.
Nine years are celebrated in different forms in different parts of the country.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd Monk)
Flowers bloom.
Not only flowers but fruits on trees are seen shining in the sun .
Fruits of summer season orange can also be seen in spring .
On the other hand, the yellow flowers of mustard stop farmers in the field.
The Kesuda flower indicates the arrival of the Holi.
Ameer Khusro has described the moments of climate change.
Ameer Khusro has written: The gardens of the gardens are simultaneously enjoyed by Banamba, Desu Phule, Koyal Phule, Dar-Dar when the nature is happy, the weather is beautiful and the people also enjoy this season.
The festival of Vasantpanchami, Mahashivratri and Holi enhances the color of happiness in the lives of the people.
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we have to farewell to Fangan last month and we are ready to welcome the new Month Chaitra.
This is a combination of two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of people of the country for the fact that whenever I want to suggestions for my heart, there is a lot of suggestions.
Bhubaneswar has written to me on the Narendra ModiApp that many people are not proud of the achievements of ISRO, and therefore, he said, six, I have given some information about 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Bharat ji thank you very much, you have sacrificed yourself on the occasion of the pride of India.
Whether it is to remove poverty, to prevent diseases, to connect with the world, to bring knowledge and prosperity, technology- science has made its place everywhere.
15th February, 2019 is a glorious day in Indias lives.
Our scientists have raised the glass of India in front of the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in a few years.
After the success of sending Mars Mission to Mangalyana on Mangal Grah, ISRO has now created a worldwide circumnavigation in the space sector.
And it is also a matter of great happiness that this is the 38th successful lunch of PSLV.
Not only for the Christians but for the entire India, it is a historic achievement.
This Coast-Effective Officer-in-Charge program of ISRO has become a wonderful world for the entire world and the world has lauded me for the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, This 104 satellites are very important.
The Carto-Sat-2D is the satellite of India and it will provide a lot of help to manufacturing, manipulation of resources, infrastructure and development integration of Urban Development.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how can the water resources that are in the country be used
As soon as we reached our satellite, we also sent some suggestions.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that our young scientists, our women scientists have led the entire campaign.
Such a strong partnership between young and women is a pride in the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
The more we congratulate our scientists for their entire team, the less.
Bahubaji has asked another question and that is India has achieved a great success in this regard regarding the safety of India.
This has not been discussed in a big way yet, but the attention of Bhubaneswar has gone on this important issue.
India has successfully tested the Bellistic Interceptor Missile in the field of Defence.
The Interception Technological Missile (ITT) has achieved success by destroying the enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km from the ground during its test.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And the speciality is that even if India comes to an invasion of a missile from a distance of 200 kilometres, then this missile will destroy it in space.
We are happy to see a new technology and a new scientific achievement.
And the curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life.
And those special intellectuals who do not allow curiosity to live in the form of curiosity, they also raise questions within them, discover new curiosity and create new curiosity.
And this curiosity becomes the reason for new discovery.
As long as he does not get the answer, he is sitting on his feet.
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life then we can say that this development journey of human life is not complete.
There is absolutely impossible.
The efforts of BrahMand to know the rules of creation and the minds of the people are continuing.
This creates new science and new technology.
And every technology gives birth to a new age of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in my heart that our younger generation should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific future becomes the reason for a stable transformation in the lives of generations.
In the past, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs had planned a very unique kind of competition on the 14th Pravasi Bharti Day.
He was invited to innovate.
I have seen how to identify, show, inform people and find out how to work for the common man, how to produce junk and how to use it and how important things have been done.
Many times the problem also demonstrates the importance of science for resolving.
In the year 2005, there was rains, floods and floods in the sea, and there was a lot of trouble, a crisis and when any natural calamity occurred, the first crisis comes to the poor.
The two brothers worked towards it with a lot of consciousness and developed the construction of a house that saves people from such tremors and saves them from water logging and can also be saved from water borne diseases.
And our society is also becoming technology-based.
Systems are also becoming technology-based.
In a way technology is becoming a unique part of our lives.
In the past, there was a great significance on Digi-Dhan.
Gradually, people are coming out of the hurry and moving towards the DGDN movement.
Digital transactions are also increasing rapidly in India.
Especially the youngsters have started adopting digital payments from their mobile phones.
I consider it good news.
In our country, the Lucky Graduate Plant Digidhan Business Yojana has received huge support in the past.
About two months have passed and 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And through these two schemes, a initiative to create digital payments in India has been welcomed across the country.
And it is a matter of great happiness that so far 10 lakh people have got the reward under the DigiDhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand traders have got the reward and more than 1.
Under this scheme, most of the consumers are those who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received rewards of fifty thousand rupees.
Whether it is a farmer, a businessman or a businessman or a householder or a student, everyone participates in this scheme with enthusiasm.
Shriman Santosh Ji has written on the Narendra Modi App from Mysore that he has received a reward of one thousand rupees under the Lucky Grawer Scheme.
But I should tell you that he has written the biggest thing.
He said, I got a reward of one thousand rupees and at the same time I realized that a poor old woman was hurt at home.
When the goods were burnt, I felt that the rewards that I got, perhaps this poor old mother had the right to do so, I gave them thousands of rupees.
You have done a very good inspiration.
All the descents keep giving information about this digital.
They keep talking with so much enthusiasm and encourage others.
I would like to appeal to the countrymen, especially to the youth of the country and to the people of this country and to the people of this country who have either received the DGDN Business Yojana.
You can move it forward and in a way it is anti-corruption worker.
In a way, you are a soldier of ethics.
You know that when the Lucky Grawer Scheme will be completed on 14th April, Dr.
It's a memorable day.
On 14th April, a huge amount of rupees will be drawn.
There are about forty-five days left.
Can you do a job by remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar
Now Babasaheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary.
You must learn at least 125 people while downloading the BHIM App.
Learn how to deal with it, learn it and especially the small traders around you.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkars Jayanti and Bhim App will be given special importance, so I would like to say, Dr.
This movement has been going on for the last two-three months, many townships, several villages and many cities have achieved great success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the root cause of our economy.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic movement of the country.
Today I want to tell you a lot of happiness.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laid the foundation stone of food by working hard.
Record food has been produced this year with the hard work of farmers in our country.
Every indicator is saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there is a harvest in the fields that it seemed as if Pongal and Baisakhi are being celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is even more than 8 percent more than the last records that have been registered in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I especially like to thank the farmers of the country.
I would like to thank the farmers for keeping in mind the traditional crops and keeping in mind the poor people of the country, they also cultivate different pulses because the poor get the most protein from pulses.
I am happy that my country's farmers listened to the sound of the poor and cultivated various pulses on about two hundred thousand hectares of land.
This is not just the product of pulses but the biggest service for the poor of my country by the farmers.
On one of my prayers, my farmer brothers and sisters are eligible for special thanks for the manner in which the farmers of my country laid down their heads and made records.
My countrymen, this is going on in our country by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organizations and by everybody towards cleanliness.
In a way, everybody is seen awakening about cleanliness.
And in the Warangal of Telangana state, it was not only a seminar in the closed room but it was to use what is the importance of direct cleanliness.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 1-18 February.
The toilet pits of six houses were cleaned up and the officials themselves showed that the twin pit toilets could be used freely and reuse them.
He also demonstrated how convenient the toilets of the new technology are and there is no discomfort in cleaning it and there is no shrinking of the psychological barrier.
And we can also clean up a toilet bay in the same way.
And the result of this effort was that through the medium of the country, it has also given importance to it and it is natural that when an IAS officer himself cleans the toilet pit, the country's attention towards it is natural.
And it is the toilet pit which we consider as waste, but it is the same as a black gold.
We can see what is happening from West to Wealth.
And this has been proved.
A standard 'Twin Pit Toilet' for the family of six members is filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and redirected to another pit.
In six to twelve months, garbage accumulated in the pit gets completely decomposed.
These decomposed wastes are very safe in handling and are extremely important inputs from the point of view of fertilizer.
Farmers are very well aware of the NPK.
And now there is a special programme for cleanliness in Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as possible.
Several departments are also celebrating cleanliness in the government.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ministry of Tribal Affairs will speed up the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, Rever Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also pursue the last two weeks of Swachhta Abhiyan in March.
We know that whenever any poor citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy, the self-confidence increases.
We all welcomed the exhibition that our disabled players performed in the Rio Paralympics.
In the Blind T-20 World Cup finalised in the same month, India has enhanced the pride of the country by defeating Pakistan as a global champion for the second time.
We are proud of the achievements of these disabled friends of the country.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
Every time we get to learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
We are moving ahead with a pace and illuminating the country with their achievements.
In the last few days, our women players won Silver Medal in Asian Ruggy Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to every player.
On 8th March, the whole world celebrates Women's Day.
In India too, there is a need to give importance to children and raise awareness about them in the family and society, enhanced indulgence.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, this movement is progressing very fast.
Today, this is not just a government programme, it has become a campaign for social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has linked the common man.
In every corner of the country, this glittering issue has compelled people to think and has brought about a change in the thinking of people towards the old traditions that have been going on for years.
When it comes to the news that the festival was celebrated on the birth of the child, it is very happy.
In a way, positive thinking towards children is becoming the cause of social autonomy.
I have heard that children have been banned under a special drive in the Kuddalore district of Tamil Nadu.
More than 15 children have been prevented.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand children under the Sukunya Samriddhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all departments have been linked to the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana and with the organisation of village councils, a lot of efforts are being made to ensure that the unborn children are adopted by the district administration.
Under the 'Har Ghar Dastak' program in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being organised for the children from rural and rural areas.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to re-inspire the children who had been drop-out by running their Children's Children's Children's School.
The meaning of saying is that this movement has been adopted in many forms of "Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao".
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New imaginations are linked to it.
It has been deployed as per the local requirements.
I consider it a good mark when we want to celebrate the Women's Day on March 8, we have the same feeling.
My dear countrymen, you have the opportunity to interact with you at different times in mind that women are powerful, powerful, they are the women of India, at least, not at all, equal officials.
I know a lot from you.
What is happening on earth, what is happening in the minds of the village and the poor reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
We have celebrated many festivals in the past.
Today, Shri Krishna Janmatsav was celebrated in entire India yesterday.
And every person can solve the problems faced by Sri Krishna's life.
Sometimes there is a feeling of innovation in every aspect of lifting eight pillars.
And therefore, today, when I am talking to you, I pay my attention to two Mohans.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohamed had also used his thoughts in order to avoid the conflict even thousands of years ago in the event of that time.
And Charkhadhari Moham had also chosen a way to strengthen the root causes of human values for freedom and to strengthen the root causes of personality. He gave a turn to the people of freedom that is surprising for the entire world today.
Be it the importance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge or the importance of laughing in the midst of all the descendings in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Shri Krishna.
Today, when we are discussing the festivals, India is engaged in the preparation of a greater festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new turn to human history, established new records.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way he has been a part of his life.
Whenever anyone, whenever they needed, Mahatma Gandhi was always present for service.
He not only emphasized the importance of service but also on self-confidence associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
The society, humanity and humanity were the same universal for Mahatma Gandhi.
Whether it is a Finics Forum in Africa or a Tolstoy Forum or Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha Ashram, he laid special emphasis on social development and community dynamism in all places.
I am fortunate to be here that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places associated with the devotee Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to emphasize the synergy with service.
Social service and socio-economic development, community service and community communication are the feelings that we can bring in our transformative life.
In fact, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No countrymen.
And collectiveness has its own strength.
Gandhi should also have community and service in all these programmes of half a century.
Why don't we get out of the whole palace
If we have a team of football then football teams will play football, but Gandhi will also work in accordance with ideals.
We can do a lot, share the old books together and spread knowledge among the poor.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore adventures.
Be it just goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and service with full dedication, and also made it for the feeling of joy and joy.
My dear countrymen, I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Satyagraha of salt in the freedom struggle, Dandi is a very important turning point.
I inaugurated a modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi of Dandi.
I urge you to visit a place associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere.
Whether it is Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha Ashram, whether it is associated with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And also write two-four words while expressing your feelings.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But in this context, one thing is very interesting, which I want to share with you.
Venice is a well-known art program called Byenal where artists from all over the world gather.
This time, a very interesting exhibition is being held at the Indian Pavilion of Venice Bay of Bengal.
The details of Haripura were particularly interesting.
You will remember that the Congressional session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected the President.
Gandhiji wanted that he should showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase his art work between the session.
This is the only Nandlal Bose whose artworks extend the beauty of our constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And his art equipment has made Nandlal Bose a immortal composition as well.
Nandlal Bose visited nearby villages of Haripura and then made some art paintings showcasing the life of rural India.
There was a lot of discussion in the Venice of Animal Arts.
Once again, the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I would like to conclude with all Indians.
For the country, for the society, something should be done for some merchant.
You will remember that in the last few years, we have launched the same service campaign in the country for nearly two weeks before the second October.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
During the campaign, we will come out of the house of ourselves and work towards Mahatma Gandhi through labour.
Whether it is houses, streets, chowks or drains, schools, colleges, and all the public places will have cleanliness.
This time there is a special emphasis on plastic.
Similarly, we have to foster the use of plastics that are being used at the same time.
This time, on the occasion of Bapus 150th birth anniversary, we will dedicate India to him, and on that day we will also lay the foundation stone of a new public movement against plastic across the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, every village, every city and every citizen of small towns and pray that this year we will celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way as a free from plastic waste.
To celebrate 2nd October as a special day.
The day of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti becomes a festival of special labour.
All the municipalities, municipalities, district-rural systems, rural panchayats, government-building systems, all the organizations, one civilian, all of them have been requested to make proper arrangements for collection and storage of plastic waste.
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are accumulated, they will come forward for proper removal and settlement systems.
It can be recycled.
This can be made a desert.
This way, we can also finish the work of safe removal of plastic waste till Diwali.
Just imagine.
There is no need to see such a thing for inspiration.
What could be more inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is a well-defined manner of knowledge.
We can find out what we need in life.
Now, my contact with them has been reduced.
But earlier my contact was very high.
Today, I want to touch a very important thing with a Sanskrit definition.
And it is written centuries ago but how important it is still today.
One of the best defined and he has said: The third Ratnani, Jalm Annam Subhasitam, Mudhai: the stone segments are the three Ratnas, the water, the food and the switched on the earth.
The idols are called stones.
There is a very great significance of food in our culture.
So far, the knowledge of food has also been changed into science.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborn children, because they are the foundations of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and interesting manner.
Once a thing was brought in my mind.
Muthibar Dhani has become a big movement in Nashik.
Anganwadi workers collect cereals in the days of crop harvesting.
These cereals are used for making fresh food for children and women.
The person who donates it becomes a citizen, a social worker in a way.
After that, he himself is dedicated to this goal and becomes a syphi of this movement.
We all have heard about the food processing culture in the corners of India.
This culture is done when the child starts feeding a fixed diet for the first time.
This is a very beautiful initiative which can be adopted anywhere.
In many states, people run Tithi Bhoja Abhiyan.
If there is a birthday, a good day or a memorable day in the family then the members of the family go to Anganwadi by making a nutritious meal, go to schools and the family members themselves serve children, feed, share their happiness and increase happiness.
There is a marvellous meeting of service and joy.
Friends, There are several small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
The entire country will be celebrated as a nutrition drive for the month of September.
I had never thought that in the hearts of our country and the youngsters of the world, I would have become such a place.
I never thought of how much diversity the youth of our country and the world pay attention to.
I had never thought that there would be any opportunity in my life to touch young Indians across the globe.
And that is how I went to Bhutan last week.
I have seen that as the Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to go from Jayar to any other person, and because of International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if anyone in the world meets and sits, then some five-seven minutes advise me about Yoga.
Discovery has organised this programme in 165 countries in their language.
Today, I am confident that this episode of the Discovery Channel will help in familiarizing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in the Sanskrit journey of India.
And people now want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But one more interesting thing is that some people ask me synonymously that Modi ji said that if you used to speak Hindi and Bir Greeles did not know Hindi, how would you have been interacting with you so fast
Or later, audited.
I ask you very carefully.
Juo, there is no secret in this.
If there is a question in the minds of many people, then I will declare this mystery.
It is not a mystery.
The fact is that technology has been immensely used in interaction with beer grills.
Sathas used to be linguistic and a small coordinate device was used in the ears of beer grills, so that it was used in English.
Although I used to say Hindi, but it used to be associated with English and this would have made dialogue more easier and this is the reason for technology.
After this show, a large number of people have been seen discussing about the GeM Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife nature and other creatures.
I have said before and I strongly tell you that Ishaan Bharat will definitely go to your life.
The world within you will expand.
From the Red Fort on 15th August, I had urged you all to visit at least 15 places in India in the next 3 years.
He also visited 15 such places with the aim of tourism. See, study, carry the family, spend some time there.
This diversity will fill you with diversity from within as a teacher.
Your life will be expanded.
Your thinking will be widespread.
And trust me that there are places within India where you will come through a new spirit, new enthusiasm, new zeal and inspiration.
Your family will also feel conscious.
My dear countrymen, the environmental care and concerns in India are natural.
Last month, I was fortunate to announce the settlement of tigers in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
A resolve was taken to express concern over the deteriorating settlement of tigers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India that we achieve the goal at a rapid pace.
We have doubled the settlement of tigers in 2019.
Not only the tiger settlement in India, but the number of bulk, reserved areas and community reserved places has also increased.
When I was proclaiming a tiger settlement, I also remember the lions of Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister, the dwelling area of lions was shrinking in the forests of Gir.
Their number was decreasing.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In 20000, it was decided to examine women guards.
Structural reforms have been made to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about protection.
But now you have to go ahead with the protection and also think about the compassion.
There is a great guidance in our scriptures.
My dear countrymen, who can forget this historic message of Swami Vivekananda Ji on September 11, 1983
The young sannyas of India, who surprised the humanity of the whole world, had left Indias glorious identity in the world.
Swami Vivekananda ji had seen the form of India, let us inspire him to live the capabilities that Swami Vivekananda ji had learned from India.
Everything is inside us, come out with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that 2nd August is celebrated as the National Sports Day.
On this occasion, we will launch a Fit India Movement-Coost India Function across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you, in Fit India on 2nd August, in the month of September, in the nutrition campaign, especially in the Swachhta Abhiyan from 11th September to 2nd October and for complete dedicated plastic liberation.
Let us come out with a new momentum, a new resolve and a new power.
My dear countrymen, this is the same in Mann Ki Baat today.
I'll get it again.
I will wait for your talks and your suggestions.
Let us all come together to make India the dream of the dreams of freedom fighters and to fulfill Gandhi's dreams.
Namaskar.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, at all times, the more important the rights are given, the more important the duties should be obtained.
The Indian Democracy can move forward at a rapid pace only on two sides of authority and taxation.
Yesterday is 30th January, our venerable Bapu's death anniversary.
On 30th January, we all pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping their lives silent for 2 minutes.
In the form of a society, as a country, on 30th January, it should be a comfortable feeling for 2 minutes on 11th.
Even if it is only 2 minutes, it should also express faith in collectiveness, determination and martyrs.
There is a simplicity of respect for the soldiers and the security forces in our country.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I extend my best wishes to the brave men and their families who have been honored with various bravery awards.
These awards include several categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal.
I urge the youngsters, especially those who are active in the social media.
You can do a job. This time, the brave men who have received this honor - write two good words related to your net and spread it in your partners.
When we know about their courage, valour and valour, we are surprised and pride and inspiration.
On the one hand, when we were happy with the news of the emergence and enthusiasm of 26th January, our soldiers who were engaged in the service of the country in Kashmir became brave due to the eclipse.
I salute all those brave men and bow down to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I have been continuously doing Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April is the month of Kasauti for every family.
There is an examination of one or two children in the house but the entire family is buried under the pressure of examination.
So I realized that this is the right time when I talk to the students friends, talk to their daughters and talk to their teachers because I have visited here for many years, the tests have been a cause of a great problem.
There is a strange psychological environment in every household where family problems, students are disturbed, teachers are distressed.
And I always feel that I should come out of this and that is why I want to talk to my young friends in some areas today.
When I declared this thing, many teachers, girls and students sent me messages, sent questions, expressed their pain and thoughts about the problems and I am thinking of what I want to talk to you today.
I got a telephone message from the world.
So I ask you so much if this atmosphere cannot be pleasant
The question has been asked by Creation but this question will be in your minds.
Observation should be an opportunity of happiness.
The whole year has worked hard, which has been the time to show, should be a festival of enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom exams are happy, but exams are a pressure for most people.
It is to be decided that you will be happy to believe that you will accept pressure.
The happiness that will be accepted will be achieved and the pressure that will be accepted will fall.
And that is why I believe that the exam is a festival, take the exams in such a way that when the festivals are held and the festivals are held, the best in us comes out.
The experience of the power of society also takes place at the time of the festival.
The best thing is that we generally feel that how much we are, but if we look at the arrangements for the Kumbh festival that runs for 40-45 days then we can imagine what is the Make-Shift Arrangement and what is the problem among the people.
This is the strength of the festival.
During the examination, a festival should also be built in the entire family, in the neighborhood of friends.
You will see that this pressure will turn into happiness.
Festivals will make it easier.
And I would like to urge my parents to create an environment for this three-four months.
It is our responsibility to make these three-four months every year in our way, by understanding our tradition, understanding the environment of our family and changing it to the festival.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you have seen yourself relaxed, you are easily relaxed and when you are relaxed, you will also be able to remember your years old things.
A year ago, what the teacher had said in the classroom would recall the entire sight.
And you should be aware that the power to recall the memory is the highest in the relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door stops, the outside does not go inside and the inside does not come out.
The idea process stops which becomes a boost itself.
It has also been seen in the examination that you remember everything. The skull recalls, the theme recalls, the skull recalls, the skull recalls, the leaf recalls that it is written upwards and it is also recalled downwards.
Why didn't you remember inside, there was pressure.
But what was inside came out immediately and came out because you were relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall the memory then it is a relaxation.
And I say on the basis of self-confidence that if there is pressure then we forget our things and if there is a relaxation then we have never imagined and suddenly those things which come to a great extent.
And it is not that you have no knowledge, it is not that you have no information, it is not that you have not worked hard.
But when tension takes place, your knowledge, your information gets lost and your tension is lost on it.
Therefore, it is necessary that A Happy Mind is the safe for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see exams in the true perspective.
It seems as if it is a question of life and death.
The exams you are going to give are the same tests that you have learned throughout the year.
This is not the story of your life.
How you live, how you live, how you live and how you want to live.
In your life, there might have been a chance of passing through a lot of hardships besides the tests taken by a notebook in classroom.
And therefore, with the success and failure of life, get rid of such burdens that there is any idea of testing.
Our former President Dr.
Hey.
Joe.
Abdul Kalam ji is a very inspirational example.
And some Ritcha Anand Ji has sent me a question: Today, the biggest challenge I can see is that education has become the center of exams.
The quality has become the most important.
This has resulted in a lot of competition and stress has also increased in the students.
So I want to know your thoughts about this present direction of education and its future.
However, they have given their answers, but Ritcha wants me to present my words here too.
Marx and Marksheet are very limited uses.
There is nothing that happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have achieved.
Whether you have tried to live with what you have learned or not.
Whether you have got the sensation of the commission, which is an ambitian of yours or not, there is no match between your commission and the ambitian.
If you believe in such things, then the Marx rising lion will follow you, you will not have to run behind the marks.
You will be able to get knowledge in your life, skill will be used, self-confidence will be useful.
You tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and every family member will go to him who is a family doctor.
There will be none of you who asked her family doctor how many qualities she had passed.
No one has asked.
Just, you felt that my brother is very good as a doctor, you are getting benefitted and you are starting to serve him.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case then do you see the mark sheet of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge and his successful journey.
And that is why the characteristics of these things sometimes stop us from moving towards the right direction.
But it doesn't mean that I say that it is not just to be read.
Its use is essential for our composition.
I was black and it is necessary to know where I am today.
Sometimes it happens and if you look closely at your own life then it will be remembered that if you fall behind the qualities, you will find a little way, you will catch some favorite things and focus on it.
But if you focus on quality then gradually you are shrinking yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get the mark.
Maybe even though there is a sense in the examination, sometimes the life becomes inadequate.
Richa ji has also said one thing - competition.
This is a very big psychological fight.
Indeed, the competition does not work to move ahead of life. And when I am competing, it means to compete with me.
How to stay better tomorrow from time to time
A special feature of the successful sportspersons is that they compete.
We take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
When you are going to give exams in every field of life, then think that if you can read peacefully for two hours, can you read for three hours
Shriman S.
Sunder ji has expressed his passion for the role of the brides.
He added that the role of the brides in the examination is very important.
He has written more. My mother didn't listen, but still she used to sit with me and tell me the example of counting.
Because the mothers are aware of the future of the children, they are active, they make things more easier.
Once you learn to accept it, most of the problems will end there.
Every guy feels that he will feel.
Volunteers are at the root of the problem as compared to teachers.
Acceptability opens the path of resolving problems.
The expectations make the wait difficult.
By accepting the situation, there is an opportunity to open a new way.
And therefore accept whatever is there.
I was present at that time and I saw that they came there and did not ask any questions about their health.
As soon as he comes, what is the situation, how is the disease, he has not talked about it.
In the first two-four minutes, the weather was lightened.
By visiting a sick person, we are afraid of him many times.
I would like to tell the girls that sometimes we do the same with the children.
Did you ever feel that during the days of examination give the child a smiling atmosphere
You see, the weather will change.
I have received a call from a team.
Namaskar, elderly Prime Minister, I cannot say my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
And when I tried to imitate myself, I got caught in it and because of me many friends around me suffered a lot.
You must have heard that many times don't shout, don't shout.
I also tell you the same thing again.
Once the temperament of the thieves falls, there will never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where can you reach
Their entire creativity, such a time that if you allow us to read in the preparation of the exam then perhaps you will not need to copy.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress we face during our exams and my second question is why it looks like a slight stress or not thank you.
If you want to develop all over the world then life is also beyond books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn.
Someone says I'll pass all these tests first, then you will.
So it's impossible.
So the rest of the body should also get physical activity.
Have you ever thought that when all this is in front of you, take a look at the sky for two moments, take a look at the trees and plants.
By doing so, you will again come in your room and your books with a freshness.
Put yourself down for a while, stand up and go to the kitchen, find out what you like, if you get a precious biscuit then eat it.
Just five minutes, but take a break.
There is no need to be closed in a room to breathe deeply.
Just go below the open sky, go to the bottom, take five minutes deep breath and then sit again to read.
You will feel that the body will become very light and the body will not only become light but will also make the brain light .
Some people feel that they will wake up late at night - I will read more.
Definitely take as much as the body needs sleep .
It's fresh.
Your efficiency will increase a lot.
When I hold meetings at the time of the election, sometimes my throat is sitting.
I came to meet a folk singer.
He came and asked me - How many hours are you sleeping
He gave me a herb.
So, indeed, if we understand the importance of these things then we will be benefitted, you will see.
But it doesn't mean that just keep sleeping.
Otherwise, the people of your family will be disappointed with me.
And the day your mark sheet comes, you will not see them, I will see them.
This is a very big medicine for keeping the mind, intelligence and body cautious.
But at the same time, he will also say, do not let it be stressed on what I have said.
So, I also appreciate the way I invite your family to not be boosted to your parents.
Remembering your commitment, go for testing and trusting yourself.
I have many good wishes.
Build a slum, a festival to get down from every slum.
And there's never a bit of bitch.
Push this mantra forward.
Dear Countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard (Indian Coast Guard) is completing forty years on February 2019.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among all its 126 ships and 62 planes built in the country among the world's four largest coast guards.
Last year, the people of Coast Guard had taken a big initiative to cleanse the beaches of our country along with their responsibilities and added thousands of people to it.
And very few people will know that in our country, not only men but women are also taking their responsibility equally in the coast guard.
The Coast Guard is also our female officer Pilot, Observer and also the Honor Craft.
Today, when maritime security is a matter of great importance in the world, I congratulate him on the fortyth anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard in the maritime security of India.
On 1st February, the Festival of Basant Panchami is held.
Spring has been accepted as the best season.
Spring is the queen of seasons .
The occasion of Vidhyana Ardha is celebrated.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the brave.
My Rang De Basanti Chola - This is the inspiration.
My best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of the Santhan Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in the matter of mind, Akashwani always fills new forms with his imagination.
Since last month, he has started listening to my heart in regional languages.
He has received a comprehensive approval.
People are writing letters from afar.
I congratulate Akashwani for his self-inspired work.
My dear countrymen, greetings and best wishes to all of you on Christmas.
Today is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Lord Jesus said that the poor are not our bonafide, we want to accept that Lord Jesus has not only served the poor but also mentioned the service made by the poor, this is the true empowerment.
There is a story associated with it which is very popular.
It has been said in the text that Lord Jesus was standing near the treasury of a temple.
Several Ameer people came there and they donated a lot.
After that a poor widow came and he donated two copper copper coins.
If you see that two copper coins are not a big donation.
It is very natural for the devotees present there to be enchanted.
The Lord Jesus said that this woman has donated the most because all others have donated a lot but this woman has dedicated herself to her all-round donation.
Today, 25th December is also the birth anniversary of the great Madan Mohan Malviyaji.
Malviya ji, who brought awareness of determination and self-confidence in the Indian people, gave a new direction to modern education.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Banaras, Malviyaji's temporary base.
I have laid the foundation stone of the Mahamahim Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre (BHU) in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre is being constructed in the entire region, not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand-Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Adarsh Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget Atal ji's contribution.
Under his leadership, we have honoured the nation by enhancing the energy sector.
Be it the leader of the party or the Member of Parliament, the Minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji presented an ideal idealism in every role.
On the birthday of Atal ji, I congratulate him and pray to God for his good health.
I was fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
Many memories along with them are swimming in front of their eyes.
Today, on the day of Christmas, as a gift, the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
In other words, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is a village or a city, whether it is trained or trained or not, how the cashless business runs, how can it be purchased without money, the atmosphere of curiosity is spread all around.
Everyone wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this, two new incentive schemes for the Government of India, the consumers and small traders are going to be launched from today to adopt e-payment habits to strengthen mobile banking.
One scheme to promote consumers - Lucky Grahak Yojana and other schemes to promote traders - Digidhan Trade Yojana
Today, as a gift of Christmas on 25th December, 15 thousand people will get anonymity from the Drop System and they will be filled with a thousand rupees each in the account of 15 thousand people and this gift is not just a day-long limit, this scheme will start from today to 100 days.
Every day 15 thousand people will get a reward of one thousand rupees.
In 100 days, lakhs of families are going to get gifts of crores of rupees but this reward will be made only when you will use mobile banking, e-Banking, Rupay Card, UPI, USSD and this digital payment system.
With this, there will be a day-long drop for such customers, including the rewards of lakhs and three months later, on 14th April.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar is born Jayanti and there will be a bumper dro which will have crores of rewards.
Digidhan Business Yojana is mainly for traders.
Traders themselves are connected with this scheme and make their business even cashless.
Such traders will also be given separate rewards and these rewards will be in thousands.
The traders will also have their own business and will also get the rewards.
This scheme has been built by keeping every section of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class in the center, and therefore, those people who buy something more than Rs. 50 and buy less than three thousand will get the benefit of this scheme.
Those who buy more than three thousand rupees will not get the benefit of this reward.
The poorest of the poor can also use the USSD and buy goods through mobile phones and sell goods and pay the money and every person can become the beneficiaries of this scheme.
Even in rural areas, people can buy and sell through AEPS and those people can also get the reward.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this Anonymous scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be enjoying this system and the youth around you will be aware of it, you can ask them.
Your family will also have children studying in the 10th-12th standard, those people will also be able to learn this easily.
This is a very simple task. The way you have sent a WTO-up message from mobile phones is that much easier.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know that how to use technology in the country, how to e-payments and online payments, the awareness is increasing rapidly.
In the last few days, cashless trade, cashless trade has increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The bigger the decision is, the traders can apply well.
The traders who will invest digitally, will develop online payment system instead of investment in their business, have been discharged from the Income Tax.
Everyone has forwarded this campaign in the form of their own self-reliance.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shriman Chandrababu Naidu has reviewed a committee which is considering several schemes in this regard.
But I have noticed that many state governments have also started and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Assam government has decided to give 10 percent of the discount on digital payment of Property Tax and Trade Licensing Fee.
The Branch of Rural Banks which will transact at least two digital transactions of their 5 shareholders in the mid-January to March, will receive 50 thousand rupees from the Government.
By 31st March, 2019, 100 Digital Transactions have been announced by the Government under the Uttam Panchayat for Digi Transaction.
Under the Digital Agricultural Scheme for the farmers, the Assam Government has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5,000 to 10 farmers, who will fully get digital payments for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate every government that has started this kind of magnificence.
Several institutions have also successfully experimented in promoting digital purchases among rural poor farmers.
I am aware that the GNFC-Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd., which is the mainly used for fertilizer, has set up a thousand POS machines where they sell their fertilizers to facilitate the farmers and 35 thousand farmers have been given through digital bags of 5 lakh fertilizer and this work has taken place in the last two weeks and the funny thing is that compared to last year, the GNFC has increased by 2 percent.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our system of life, informal sector is very large and most of the people are paid in cash, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money and money, and we know that this is why the laborers are exploited.
Where they get 100 rupees, they get 80, they get 50, and they are deprived of other healthcare facilities like insurance.
But now cashless payments are being made.
The money is being deposited directly in the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the informal sector, the exploitation has been stopped and the bitterness has been shut down and it has become possible for the workers, artisans and such ordinary people to get a complete turn.
They are also becoming enthusiastic to the benefits of other benefits.
Our country is the country of most youths.
We have access to technology.
The country like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youngsters have made great progress from start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
We should also link our youngsters with new ideas, with new technologies and innovative ways to make this region so strong, as well as with the campaign to liberate the country from black money and corruption.
Most of the other writers have taken note of the fact that such a good work, the work of the country's will, the sacred work, but how cow slaughter is happening, how to find new ways for misunderstanding.
And the third point is that in which people have supported what is happening, but with the help of this fight, corruption and black money should be destroyed, they should take more steps, such enthusiasm and writers are also there.
I am grateful to the countrymen, I have helped in writing all such letters.
Shriman Gurumani has written only on MyGov: "This step to curb black money is commendable.
We are suffering from the people, but we are fighting against corruption and we are happy with the support we have given in this fight.
We are fighting against corruption, black money etc. The same spirit is emerging in the corner of the country as Gaurumani Kabul ji has written.
We all are feeling it.
But it is also true that when people are suffering and suffering, then there is such a person who does not suffer
I am also suffering as much as you are suffering.
But for an excellent purpose, the people of the country remain in the midst of sufferings, sufferings and sufferings, while working with a good intention to achieve a higher goal.
In fact, these people are the foremost of transformation.
I also thank people for another reason that they have not only restricted the problems but have also responded to some people who are trying to mislead the people.
Somebody has said that the price of salt has increased, somebody has to expand, somebody has to register a note of 2000, somebody has to register a note of 500 and 100.
I also congratulate the people for this strength.
My dear countrymen, I am clearly feeling that it is impossible for the people of the country to grow up with you.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country and congratulate them that people have participated in this great joy in front of corruption and black money.
There will also be a comprehensive discussion in the House for political parties and for political parties.
If the Parliament had been going on, it would have been a good discussion.
Those who are spreading rumors that the political parties are all relieved, they are wrong.
Those who are unable to support open corruption and black money, they are constantly trying to find out the government's errors.
This government is for the welfare of the people.
The government is constantly trying to reflect the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the very first day, the eighth day said that this fight is extraordinary.
The power of the candidates who have been associated with the black business of BEIMAN and corruption for the last 0 years.
If I have decided to meet such people then those people also adopt new tasks everyday to defeat the government.
I would like to convey my best wishes to the people of the country.
How did this become possible
I have told her mystery.
The mystery is that I am getting all these information from the people.
More than the information received by the government system, we are getting more and more from the people of the country and most of us are getting success because of the awareness of the common people.
Can anyone imagine how many dangers the citizens of my country are being taken to open such elements
And most of the information that is being received is being achieved.
I am confident that the government has given an email address for this - you can also send it on whom you have asked for such a recognition.
You can also send it to Goa.
There is also a third group of letter writers and they are also in large numbers.
He says that Modi will not get tired, will not stop, and whatever hard steps have to be taken, but once we have taken the path, we have to reach Manjil.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who write such letters because there is also a certain belief in their letters and blessings.
And there is no question of returning to the work for which hundreds of crores of people are blessed.
We have expelled it and have made the law of a very strong Benami Property.
In the coming days, the law will also do its job.
For the countrymen, it is our priority to do whatever we have to do for the welfare of the people.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month, I had said that even among these problems, our farmers have broken the record of last year by doing hard work.
This is a good sign of agriculture.
Be it the laborer of this country, the farmer of this country, the youth of this country, the hard work of all of them is bringing a new color today.
In the past, India has engraved its name in many fields on the World Economic Forum.
India has jumped 32 in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have enhanced 16 locations in the World Banks Transport Efficiency Index 2016.
There are several reports that have been directed towards this direction as well. India is moving forward at a fast pace.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the inaugural function.
But in such things, sometimes some good things are made and then the mind gets a great satisfaction.
An excellent work has been done between the House of Parliament which has not been taken care of by the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am very proud to tell you that a legislative parliament associated with the campaign that my government had taken out of Divyang-Ja.
I express my gratitude to all the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to millions of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to the disabled.
I have also tried to make it more satisfactory by personally.
I mean, the Divyangjans get their huck and respect, which they are entitled to.
Our efforts and beliefs have been strengthened by our Disabled Brothers and sisters when they brought four lunar winners in Paralmipix.
He has not only enhanced the dignity of the country by his victory, but also surprised the people with his capacity.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, we have an invaluable heritage like every citizen of the country.
Today, I am happy that after the passage of this law in the interest of the Divyangjans, the Divyangs will have more chances of jobs.
For them, the limit of unemployment in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides special attention to the prevention of education, facilities and grievances of the disabled.
You can imagine how sensitive the government is for the disabled people that in the last two years, the central government has organised four thousand three hundred fifty camps for the disabled.
The government has passed a new legislation in accordance with the spirit of the nation.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there have been reports from the sports grounds that have made us all proud.
Being Indian, it is very natural for us to be proud.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four-four winners in the category of anti-England.
Some young sportspersons were eligible to work.
Virat Kohli of the test drive, along with the best batting, also led the best.
Indian Cricket Team Off-Spinner R.
ICC has declared Ashwin as the best cricketer and best test cricketer in 2016.
My best wishes to you all.
After fifteen years, good news came in Hockey's field.
Our junior hockey team captured the World Cup.
After fifteen years, this opportunity has come that Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
Congratulations to young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign of the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also earned a lot.
India's women hockey team also won Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days back, India's women hockey team concentrated in the Asia Cup competition for the players below 18 years of age.
I heartily congratulate all the cricket and hockey teams.
Last month, we were all enjoying Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again visited the border with China to celebrate Diwali.
I celebrated the height of the Himalayas with the soldiers of ITBP.
Not only this, the good wishes that the countrymen had sent, in their happiness, were a wonderful reflection of the security forces of the country.
And people had not just sent messages but they had joined their minds.
Someone made a video that means almost every house became the guardian of the soldiers.
And whenever I saw those letters, I was also surprised that how much imagination and how many feelings were filled and MyGov thought that by giving some select things, a coffee table book should be made.
Work is going on.
With the contribution of all of you, the imagination of the feelings of the soldiers of the country will be integrated into this scripture.
But this time it didn't seem like that.
This time there was no such thing that there was a festival and I wasn't at home.
It seemed as if we were celebrating the Diwali with hundreds of crores of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases by 125 crore.
Just a few days ago, I had come to meet all the Sarpanches of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with so much affection, these Sarpanches of the villages spoke so much that everything touched my heart.
I requested him to go and focus on the future of those children.
Today, I am glad that all those Sarpanches from the Kashmir Valley, who had fulfilled their promises and made people aware of them.
Just a few days back when the board was tested, about 95 percent of the students and students from Kashmir participated in the board exams.
The participation of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieve new heights of development through education for a bright future.
I congratulate him for his enthusiasm but along with his parents, his sons, his teachers and all the village Sarpanches.
Dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked for a message from the people for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that all the suggestions have come on one side.
Everyone used to say, talk in detail on the 500 and one thousand notes.
However, on 8th November at night, while addressing the nation, I discussed the launch of a great campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal and it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decisions are, the more important it is.
And I was supposed to have to face many new problems in our normal life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take 50 days to get out of its effect and then we can go towards normalcy.
The diseases that we have been suffering from forty-seven years cannot be easy to get rid of these diseases.
I can understand your problems and challenges in a good way.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation, many efforts are being made to illustrate you, even though sometimes the stunned incidents come out, you have well understood this path of truth, you have accepted this thing of the country's interest to shut down the notes of five hundred and thousand.
And such a big country, such a number of novels, Abjo-Khurwa Noats and this decision-making world is watching very finely, every economist is analyzing and analyzing it.
The whole world is looking at whether the lives of crores of people of India will also achieve success by tackling the difficulties and difficulties.
There may be questions in the minds of the world.
India has only faith in hundreds of millions of countrymen. It is believed that hundreds of millions of countrymen will continue to fulfill their resolve.
And our country will pursue, scatter and come out in every way like gold and the reason for this is the citizens of this country.
The path of success has also been made possible because of you.
All the units of central governments, state governments and local bodies across the country, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work in dedication and dedication.
In the midst of various tensions, all of these people are working with a very peaceful mindset as a sacrifice for the service of the country and a great transformation.
If you start in the morning then you will never know when the night will fall, but you are doing everything.
And this is the reason that India will succeed in it.
And I have seen that all the people of the Bank and the Post Office are working in the midst of such difficulties.
And if we talk about humanity then they are seen two times ahead.
Someone told me that an older brother was suddenly hit in the segment.
Suddenly money was needed.
I am happy to know that they have brought money to their homes and to help in treatment.
Such cases come out every day in TV, media, newspapers and interactions.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the colleagues who work hard in this greatness.
The power will be followed only when you cross the bottom.
I remember that the campaign for the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was underway and the way the workers of the bank had taken it on their shoulders and the work that was not done in the last seventeen years was shown by them.
Today, once again, he has raised this challenge and I am confident that the commitment of the millions of people and the collective support of all will make this nation a new power.
He is looking for ways to save his money.
It is a matter of sadness that he has also discovered the path by using the poor.
Some people are trying to save the money by illusioning the poor, talking about greed or greed, putting money in their accounts or doing some work with them.
I would like to tell such people today whether to improve or not, whether to adhere to the law, whether to adhere to the law or not.
But please don't shut yourselves down with the lives of the poor.
Do not do anything so that the name of the poor comes on the record and when it is checked then my dear poor people get stuck in trouble due to your sins.
And the laws of Anonymous Property have been made so hard that it is being implemented, it will create a lot of problems and the government does not want our countrymen to face any problem.
My name crosses Ashish.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Tirali तहसील, Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say several examples in Mann Ki Baat that people have welcomed this tough decision for the upliftment of their nation despite being uncomfortable, which will enhance enthusiasm among the people and I am with the entire nation that the Castle System is very important for nation building.
I am very happy that you have shut down a network of thousands and fiftys.
I am speaking from these villages of Koppal district of Karnataka, Yelappa Wellankar.
I would like to thank you because you had said that good days will come, but no one thought you would make such a big decision.
500 thousand notes have been received by black money and corruption.
Every citizen of India will never have better days than this.
I would like to congratulate you all for this.
Some things are known through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm to work increases.
There is so much joy, so much proud that my country has a wonderful potential for the common man.
Go back to the ground and get the opportunity to pass through this road then you will definitely pay the money.
And people go there and pay the money when they pass again after two-four days.
This is the strength of my country, including service feelings, feelings and authenticity of sacrifice.
I used to discuss in the election and this thing has reached the whole world.
Many people from across the world have also learnt to speak the word 'Chair Dialogue'.
But I didn't know that there would be a wedding in Chan Char Char Charcha.
I came to know that on 17th November, a wedding took place in Surat, which was held with Cha-Operations.
In Surat, Gujarat, a daughter had only given tea to those who came to the wedding and did not spend any other expenses.
Bharat Maru and Saksha Parmar of Surat, who have contributed to the fight against corruption through their marriage, have been inspired by the fight against black money.
When I was late at night, I saw that there was a small village named Dhekia Juli in Assam.
There are tea garden artisans who get money every week.
What did they do when they got a boat of two thousand rupees
Four women from the neighborhood gathered together and shopped around and paid a boat of two thousand rupees, they did not need a small boat because they purchased together and decided that we will sit and see the account when we meet next week.
People are searching for ways of self-reliance.
And also see changes.
A message has been received from the government and people from the tea plantations of Assam are saying that we should set up ATM there.
See how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefit from this campaign.
The country will get benefits in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each municipality gets fifty percent tax rate.
But this time, due to this decision of the eight-wheeler, all the people ran to submit their old notes.
About three and a half thousand crore rupees have been made in 47 urban units last year.
You will be surprised to know that 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in just one week.
Now it is natural to have four times the money in the municipality that the water system will be arranged in the poor population, the water system will be arranged and the Anganwadi system will be arranged.
There are several such examples in which its direct benefits are also seen.
Brothers and sisters, Our village and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new transformation of the economy, every citizen is enabling himself in the midst of difficulties.
In the midst of difficulties, farmers have also found ways.
The government has also taken several important decisions that have given priority to the farmers and the villages, but still there are difficulties, but I am confident that even if there is any difficulty or natural calamities, it will continue to be a stir.
The small traders of our country, who provide jobs, also increase economic strategies.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that even small shopkeepers of the village would now be able to do business for 24 hours, no law could stop them because I believed that if a large number of people get 24 hours then why should not the poor shopkeepers of the village get it
A major initiative has been taken towards granting loans to them from the Mudra Yojana.
Millions of crores of rupees have been transported to such small people because a large number of people do business and speed up their businesses.
But it is natural for them to suffer from this decision.
You can also download the bank's app in mobile phones.
You can also set up POS machines for credit cards. You can learn how to trade without a boat.
Technological routes are safe and quick.
I would like you to help in making this campaign a success and not only you will also lead the change and I am confident that you can lead the change.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of technology in the entire village business.
I also want to tell my dear brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a footpath on the paper and when it comes in hand, it is different.
Sometimes there is a complete footage and sometimes there is a rise outside, it has to give some shares and the labour force makes this exploit a part of life.
With this new system, we would like you to be in the bank, your loans will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum weight is followed.
Nowadays, your mobile phones also work as e-packets. You can also pay the money from the same mobile phones that you want to buy from the small shops in the neighborhood.
Therefore, I urge the younger brothers and sisters to become partners in this scheme because eventually, I have taken such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the deprived, the deprived and the victims of this scheme.
Today, I specially want to talk to the youth.
We say in the world that India is a country that has 65 percent of the population, less than 35 years of age.
Young women and youngsters of my country, I know that my decision would have been liked by you.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you are contributing to this thing in positive way.
But brothers and sisters, you are my true soldier, you are my true partner.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharati and we have the opportunity to take the country to the economic height.
Can my youngsters help me
I would like to assure you that you will not stop talking about it.
As much experience as you are in today's world, not as old generation.
Maybe your family does not know the elder brother and may not even know parents, Kaka-Kaki, mother-in-law.
You know what the app is, you know what the online banking is, you know how to book online tickets.
All these things are very common for you and you also use it, but today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream of 'Cashless Society'.
100 percent of the cashless society is not possible but will India launch the 'Lase Case Society'
Once today, if we launch the 'Lase Case Society', the keys of the Cacheless Society will not be far away and I will see your physical help in it, you will see your time and your determination.
And I am confident that you will never disappoint me because we all want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know that there is a lot of opportunity for digital banking or mobile banking for the cashless society.
Each bank provides online facility.
Wollet means e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards and after 8th, which was used very little.
The poor have started using RuPay cards and about 300 per cent has been increased.
Just as printed cards come in mobile phones, printed cards are available for spending money in banks.
One of the best platforms is the UPI which you can also buy, send money, get money, and it is easier for you to send it to Whatsapp.
How to send a message on Whatsapp to the people who are uneducated.
Moreover, technology will be so easy that there is no need for a big smartphone for this work.
Everybody has also got it and now the cost of online surcharge has also been deprived of it and it has also been given to other such cards that in 2-4 days, every cost has been ruined in Akhbar, so that the cost of cashless society can be strengthened.
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation who is unaware of it.
And as much as I know, everybody is active in this great work.
Just as the creative messages you have sent on the Wattspeed, I see all this, slogans, poems, poems, cartoons and new ideas, and how many of our young generations have the power to create these problems, it seems that this India is the speciality of the land that the Gitas had emerged in the battlefields of some age, similarly today we have been passing through such a larger transformation, the basic creativity within you will also be seen.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I want your help in this work.
Yes, I once again say that I want your help and I am confident that crores of young people of my country will do this thing.
You should do a job, from today itself, you will become a part of yourself for the 'Cashless Society'.
The technology that you have to spend online on mobile phones is available.
Not only this, what is this technology for at least 10 families, how to use technology, how to download their bank's app and how to spend the money spent in your account
How can the shopkeepers also learn or trade
You voluntarily have to undertake the campaign to bring out the casualty of this case society, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to free people from problems and problems.
Once people use the RuPay card, they will teach you how the poor will bless you.
If the common citizens have to learn this system then they will probably get rid of all the concerns and if all the youngsters of India get involved in this work then I do not believe that it will take more time.
Within a month, we can grow in the form of a new modern India in the world and this work can be done through your mobile phones.
You can go to 10 houses every day and add 10 houses to it.
I invite you, come, not just support but we will continue to be the servants of this transformation and change.
We will move ahead with this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and is a rich country in the world where youngsters have changed the lives of the nation and have to believe that those changes that bring youngsters, revolutionaries, youngsters.
He said that M-PESA has used the technology of a mobile system, which has been named M-PESA and today almost all the businesses in this area of Africa have come up in Kenya.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again request you to move ahead with this campaign.
I invite you to do this work in every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, collectively.
We will take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the best of the country, which is not to miss the opportunity.
Dear brothers and sisters, today is the day of the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country, Shri Harivansh Rai Bachchan ji and today on the birthday of Harivansh Rai ji, Shri Amitabh Bachchan has given a name for this cleanliness drive.
It may have been mentioned that the most popular artist of this century, Amitabhi ji, is moving forward the cleanliness drive.
It seems that the topic of cleanliness has spread in his nerves and at the same time he remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth anniversary.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
So, his son, Shriman Amitabh Ji, who is running a mission of cleanliness in his nurses, has sent me to write by using the poems of Harivansh Rai, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, Mara.
I salute Harivansh Rai ji.
I also thank Shriman Amitab Ji for connecting him with Mann Ki Baat in this way and pursuing the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, through your thoughts, your sentiments and your letters, Narendra Modi always connects me with you on MYGOV.
Now there are 11 wagons, but after that we will also start in regional languages.
I am grateful to the Akashwani, the new initiatives that those people have taken so that even where Hindi language does not exist, my countrymen will get the opportunity to connect with it.
Thank you very much.
Those who see from far flung places feel as if Indians are the second name of the Festival of Life and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been traditionally traditional in India since the Vedic times have been a festival that has brought about changes in time.
We have seen the courage to finish the tradition of external festivals from time to time and changes in the festivals as per the requirements of time and society have also been easily accepted.
And he does through this festival.
Our ancestors have accepted these things in a very scientific manner.
Today, the whole world discusses the environment and natural destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival tradition of India is brilliant to nature love and it is from children to every person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody has been a festival of responsibility.
Nowadays we keep lunch on Sunday, but those who are old generations, those who are workers, fishermen etc.
So far, we have also developed the tradition of connecting the lunch and science there.
Today, as we celebrate Deepawali, I said, every festival of ours is academic.
We all know one thing well, go to any corner of India, come from Amir to Amir's house, go from the poor to the hut of the poor, in the festivals of Deepawali, in every family, cleanliness drive is seen.
The corner of the house is cleaned.
But the need of the hour is not only to clean our house but also to clean the entire premises, to clean the entire palace and to clean the entire village.
We have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated in some form or the other in all the countries of the world.
Several governments of the world, the Parliament there, the rulers there have also started becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
Whether it is east or west, whether it is a developed country or developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, Deepawali's smoke is visible.
You all know that the US Postle Service of the United States has also released Deepawali postal stamp this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his television tweet on the occasion of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Britain organised this swearing-in ceremony to connect all the people in London for Diwali, he himself took part in it and perhaps the UN.
And what is Tasvir
16 women MPs from Singapore have worn out of the Parliament wearing Indian saddles and these photographs have been viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
Today, Deepawali festival is being celebrated in every streets of Singapore.
The Prime Minister of Australia has congratulated the Indian community on the occasion of Deepawali in different cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand had visited.
He said that I have to return so soon, I have to attend the Deepawali festival. I mean, the festival of Deepawali is becoming an inspirational festival to bring the world community from darkness to light.
On Deepawali's festival, along with good clothes, good eating habits, there is heavy smoke of flames.
And the children and the youth are very happy.
At times it is also not taken care of what is happening around .
During Deepawali, news of accidents, news of fire and news of misbehavior cause a lot of concern.
And it is also a matter of fact that in the days of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with a large number of parents.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in our country.
It is not just one day.
Govardhan Pooja says, brothers and sisters, beneficiaries and take them to the light of Kartik Purnima for a long time.
At the same time, we also celebrate the festival of Diwali and prepare for Chhath Puja.
Chhath Puja is a very big festival in the eastern region of India.
But one feature of this is that it gives deep messages to the society.
But it is said that the people of the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the setting sun is also worshipped .
A very big social message is in this festival...
I would like to convey my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Deepawali.
But there is also a special time for me.
I would like to express my gratitude, especially for the countrymen.
In the last few months, the events that have been taking shape, our soldiers are looting their services for our comfort.
The sacrifices, penance and hard work of the soldiers on my future world are continuing.
And one of these things was inspired to dedicate these Deepavali Defence Forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called the message to solvers.
But today I would like to say that there will be no human being in India whose days the unprecedented love for the people of the country, the pride of the army, the manner in which it has been expressed, gives strength to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine how much we cannot imagine to go to the peaceful forces, it has emerged as a message of yours.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor, traders, shopkeepers, politicians, sportspersons or filmmakers, fortunately anybody who has not sent a lamp for the country's people, has not sent a message to go to the country, broadcasting mediums have also turned this lamp into an opportunity to express gratitude to the army.
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Water Resources, Groundways, Air Force, Coast Guard, I cannot call everyone's name, but what kind of evil happens to our visit
I can imagine how proud this moment is for my countrymen.
All such works have been done on the message to solvers' healthcare, what will be resistant or what
I want to read that Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem.
Such sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message. Come, what do we say to the Fauji family
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I call Shiva's sight.
Our Fouzi brothers are encouraging the message that Deepawali has launched.
I am from a luxury family.
My husband is also an officer of Lashkar.
My father and father-in-law have been the officers of the army.
So we are filled with the entire family.
I want to say that along with the officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also give such a good sacrifice.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers are not only on the border but also on every stage of life.
Whether it is a natural calamity or a calamity of law and order, sometimes it is to show courage to bring back the youngsters who have gone wrong ways, our youngsters are working inspiring the nation on every aspect of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from open defecation free.
Now Himachal has also been formed and the first November Kerala is also going to be formed.
But how can this success be seen
Now our ITBP jawans had gone to the village in their holidays on their own.
So, perhaps the village council had to meet at that time, they had reached the village council and they were discussing the toilets.
It was found that some families could not make toilets due to lack of money.
This glimpse should be forgotten, and see their patriotism, it was not that he served the country only to leave the pills on the enemies.
He extracted seventeen thousand rupees from his checkbook and handed it over to the Sarpanch of the village and said, "Give one thousand rupees to every family from me, and make our village free from open defecation.
I would like to express my gratitude to the youth.
I am aware that in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no road, one can reach the village hardly walking all day long.
The tribal Panchayat Idmalakudi is difficult to reach there, that is why people used to not go there, in the nearby urban areas, the engineering students came to know that toilets are to be constructed in this village.
NCC's cadets, NSS youth, engineering students and students together decided that we will build toilets.
These youngsters took up their pillars and walked all day long in the Pella Jungle.
The youngsters made toilets in the village after their own hard work and freed a small village in remote forests.
This is the reason that Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat has also declared more than 150 municipalities free from open defecation.
10 districts have also been declared free from open defecation.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on November 1, and he has decided that within a few months he will open up the entire state.
So far, he has completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I congratulate the citizens of all these states for joining this great work and contributing to the elimination of darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of schemes in the government and after the first scheme, the first scheme has to be accomplished in accordance with it.
But generally no one pays attention to these things.
Old schemes are also going on and new schemes are also going on and they are also waiting for the coming schemes.
This is going on.
There is no need for kerosene for households in which there is gas connection and electricity in our country.
Those families who have gas connections, who have electricity, have been supplied with Aadhaar numbers and I have heard that in the present survey, seven or eight districts have been released from kerosene.
I am confident that the entire state will soon become kerosene free.
And the facility of the people will also increase. Yes, it will be difficult, the middlemen will be suffering.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always guiding for all of us.
Everything that should be done, what should the country be
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you make a plan, first of all remember the poor and weak face and then decide whether the poor will get any benefit from what you are going to do or not
You can decide on the basis of this criteria.
Now, we have to satisfy the hopes of the poor people of the country.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problems.
Whatever our old thinking, the society has to be freed from the discrimination of the daughter-in-law.
There should be 21st century and there should be darkness in the village.
And that is why in order to free the villages from darkness, the Mahavidhan of providing electricity to the villages is progressing successfully.
The time is progressing in the boundaries.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the health of the poor mother and 4000 cigarettes of smoke in the day by cooking a kitchen on the wooden cheek
Such five crore families are moving ahead with success to provide smoke free life and this is a corpus.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milkmen, niece shopkeepers, princely states, used to be stuck in the midst of trade.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 31st October, the great man of this country has made the unity of India the mantra of his life.
On the one hand 31st October is the festival of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb.
On the other hand, there is also the death anniversary of Smt.
We should also remember the purity of the great men.
But one of the people of Punjab, his pain and sorrow touched me, Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, I am speaking Jasseep.
From Punjab, sir, you know that on 31st Territory is the birthday of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel is such a wonder that spent his entire life connecting the country and I feel that he has succeeded and brought everyone together.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a single person.
One Sardar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done the work of uniting the country.
Successful efforts to bring Azad Hindstan down a flag, such a great Bhagirath work that the Mahapurusha has done is a 100th bowl to the great man.
But it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, was swinging for unity, because of his priority of unity, but never left the path of unity.
On the birth anniversary of the great man who lived for unity, and on the birthday of Sardar, we all suffer a lot from history.
But we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity between these links.
Unity in diversity is the strength of that country.
There are many languages, varieties, wears, eating and drinking, but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
The Prime Minister of unity lays strong foundations of the best India.
Sardar Sahebs lifestyle was inaugurated by a struggle for farmers.
The son of the farmer.
Sometimes many of us listen to the name of Amul.
People are also aware of every manufacturing of Amul today outside India and India.
But very few people would know that it was Sardar Saheb's divine vision which had imagined the Cooperative Milk Producer Association.
And Kheda district which was then called Kera district, and in 142 he emphasized this idea.
This is a living example of how Sardar Saheb had created happiness and prosperity for the farmers today.
I pay my respects to Sardar Saheb.
And on this solidarity day, on 31st October, whenever we are, remember Sardar Saheb and resolve unity.
My dear countrymen, this series of Deepawali festivals is also a festival of the Prakash Parv of Kartik Purnima (Deepawali).
Guru Nanak Dev, his intention is not only for the entire humanity, but for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the Prime Minister of peace, unity and harmony.
As we were at the top of the distortion of touch, casteism, tallness and deformity, Guru Nanak Dev was chosen as his partner.
Come, let us also showcase the knowledge that Guru Nanak Dev has given us, who inspires us to leave discrimination, if we have to move ahead with the mantra of 'Saath Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas', who can be our better guide.
I also salute Guru Nanak Dev, when this light festival of his birthday is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again the name of the people of the country is Diwali.
Thank you very much.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, we have lost 18 brave dreams of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir in the last few days.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay my tributes to them.
It was enough to surprise the entire nation.
There is also condolences and indignation in the country. And this loss has not only fallen to those families who have lost their daughters, brothers and sisters, who have lost their daughters.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
We have many opportunities to speak to the citizens and politicians and we also speak.
But the army doesn't speak, the army records it.
Today, I would like to talk to the people of Kashmir as well.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national impartialities.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have come out on the path of peace by mixing such elements with them.
Every mother-father wants to work as fast as school-colleges are concerned, the farmers are also feeling that their crops, fruits etc. have been prepared in the markets across India.
Economic activities are also going well.
And for the last few days, the cargo has started running well.
We are well aware that peace, unity and harmony are the solutions to our problems, our progress is also the path of development.
We have to reach new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that every problem will be solved by sitting with us, finding ways and guiding a better path for the future generation of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that rule.
In order to maintain law and order, the system has to take some steps.
And we will fully follow it.
Sometimes the ideas that we think, the people who think of Judah also present innovative ideas.
At present, I get the opportunity to know a lot in social media.
From every corner of India, there is a chance to know and understand the feelings of every kind of people, and it strengthens the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th standard had a different kind of thought before me.
He has written that I was very disturbed after the Uri terrorist attack.
But there is no way to do something, and what can be done by a small student like me
Out of this, I was wondering how I would also work for the countrymen.
And I conceded that I will study 3 hours a day.
The country will be the best civilian.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere of anger, at such a young age, you can imagine well.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that there is a huge value for the people of the country.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
But you would be aware that as the 165 war was fought, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was leading us and there was such a passion throughout the country, the spirit of patriotism.
Everyone wanted something or the other, and wanted to redeem something.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this feeling of the country.
He inspired the people of the country to work for the country by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
Another way to express the country's voices between Bomb and Banduk is for every citizen, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri said.
Mahatma Gandhi ji was also running the freedom movement, the movement was at a rapid pace and there was a need for stability in the movement, when he used to use the rapidity of the movement to move towards constructive work in the society.
All of us, the army, the people sitting in the house will fulfill their duties and if we contribute something constructively with the feelings of the countrymen, every citizen and every citizen, then our country will surely make a new progress.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the players who went to Paralympics have created history and their sight is a victory of human emotion.
Shri Varun Vishwanath has also written on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done a great job and you should mention this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only this, every person in the country has had an emotional link with our players of the Paralampik.
Perhaps the Paralampike and our sportspersons have completely changed our perspective towards humanity, our perspective towards Disability.
There is a great power in this sentence.
This time, 1 sportspersons including 3 women from our country participated in Paralympics.
In comparison to other sportspersons, physical ability, sports skills are more important than all these.
He won the second Golden Centre in the Golden Centre, Devendra Jhajria Bhalafanc and also won again after 12 years.
After winning the Golden Centre, the zeal also decreases a little.
But Devendra stated that the age of the body was not able to weaken his commitment and again after 12 years he brought the golden lunar.
And he was not disabled from birth.
He had to lose one hand because of the power cut.
You can imagine that the person who gets the first golden hub at the age of 23 and at the age of 35, he has done so much in his life.
He won the Golden Centre in a high jump.
And Thangawelu lost his left leg at the age of just 5.
Poverty also did not come under the influence of their culture.
They neither live in big cities nor from the middle class Ameer family.
In spite of passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, the country has been enhanced by commitment amongst physical problems.
With the name of Deepa Malik of sports, many kinds of winners have been honored.
Varun C.
Bhati received bronze medals in high school.
These monuments of Paralympics are of great importance, but these monuments have done a great job in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, in our divine brothers and sisters.
Our sensitivities are not only awake but our vision to look at these disabled people has also changed.
Very few people will know how these disabled persons have performed in the periphery of this time.
Just a few days back, the Olympics competition took place in the same place.
This time it has been built.
The 1500 meter race in which the Olympics contest was won by the Golden Centre, Abdeltif Baka of Algeria established a new Vikram for a short span of 1500 meter competition for the disabled.
Not only that, I was surprised that the fourth among the Divyangjans who had not received any lunar as a race contestant, but they had also run shorter time than the Golden Chunder winners in the general race competition.
Once again, I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving towards making a smooth plan for the development of Paralympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in the Navasari of Gujarat.
There was a very passionate moment for me.
A Mega Camp was organised by the Government of India for the disabled and it was set up by many people.
On that day I also got the opportunity to dedicate a book, which has collected some of the successful stories of the Divyangjans in the book.
Very inspiring events.
The world record was built on the soil of India and innovators, which I consider important.
Within eight hours, it was successfully used to give ears to six hundred disabled persons who could not hear.
He was ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us to set up three World Cups by the Disabled one day.
My dear countrymen, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Pujay Bapu two years ago.
And that day I had said that cleanliness should become our nature and every citizen should become the fervour.
When the next two years are taking place on October, I can assure you that awareness has increased in the minds of millions of people of the country towards cleanliness.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness. Today we can all say that everybody has tried to move one step ahead.
That is, the country has moved towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is true.
Its results are so good and some such efforts have also seen what happens.
Be it bus stations, railways, school or colleges, religious places, hospitals, hospitals, Harkoi, from children to old people, villages, poor, farmers, women, all are contributing to some cleanliness.
The media friends have also played a positive role.
However, we still have to move forward.
For health, for the dignity of the citizens, especially for the dignity of the mothers and sisters, the practice of going to the trees should be stopped.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in a very close future towards liberation from open defecation habit.
Recently, when I went to Gujarat, the officials told me that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will fully achieve the goal of the ODF.
I want to present a scheme especially for young friends who use technology today.
Everyone has the right to know what is the situation in your city of Swachhta Abhiyan and that is why the Government of India has given a telephone number - 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
By calling these 16 numbers, not only will you know the situation of construction of toilets in your city but will also be able to come up to make toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Moreover, a Swachhata App has been launched to find out the situation of cleanliness related complaints and disposal of complaints.
The Government of India has also called upon the corporate world to come forward in this regard.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
This cleanliness drive cannot be done only by keeping it limited to Sanskrit.
If cleanliness becomes a nature then it is not enough.
This waste waste waste waste waste waste has also been started by the Government during the policy process.
Further companies have been asked to buy the compost-central fertilizer produced from the waste.
And the farmers who want to go to Savikheti can reach this fertilizer.
Those who want to improve the health of their soil, worry about the health of the soil, those who ask for the prevention of such damage due to chemical fertilizers, if such fertilizers are required, then the companies will give them such assurances.
And Shriman Amitabh Bachchan is contributing greatly to this work as a brand ambassador.
I also invite youngsters to create new start-ups in Kanchan Jhumbash from west to wealth-waste.
This year, from 25th September to 2nd October, a special event - Indonesian India Swachhta Parishan is also being organised.
Throughout the country, the ministers, chief ministers, mayors, commissioners of the cities, all of them have to concentrate deeply on cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
What can be the economic infrastructure
How can people participate
How to increase employment opportunities in this
All matters are to be discussed.
And I am seeing that there is a new news about cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University have launched a awareness campaign to build toilets by visiting 10 villages.
He himself laboured and contributed towards making about a thousand toilets.
Just a few days ago, you must have seen that under the leadership of Vingakmandar Param Vir Singh, a team swimmed away from Devprayag to Gangasagar, 2800 kms of journey and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made an entire year calendar timetable in the Department of Personnel.
Every department will focus on cleanliness in particular for 15 days.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development will work together to enhance sanitation in the field of autonomy from 1st to 15th October in the next month.
And within the last two weeks of the month of October 16 to 31st October, the other three departments, the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and the Department of Consumer Affairs, will conduct a cleanliness drive in the areas connected to them for 15 days.
It may have been mentioned that now cleanliness is also being carried out.
Once again, the report was presented to the people of the country as to what is the situation of cleanliness by doing the survey of 3 cities.
Now there are 5000 cities in the country with more than one million people and this makes a belief in every city that let us remain behind, but for the next time we will do something better.
Cleanliness is an atmosphere of competition.
I hope that all of us can contribute to this campaign.
The next October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is also taking two years.
I urge Gandhi Jayanti to buy something from Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali.
This time too, I urge that every family should have some kind of khadi so that the light of light can be lighted in the house of the poor.
When this is the second October, how can we connect ourselves in the work of cleanliness as a citizen
If you're a widow, send a video.
If our efforts in the entire country will once again strengthen this movement, new momentum will be achieved.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
And I have seen that in the past, I have said to leave gas subsidy and the revenge given by the countrymen itself is a very inspiring event of national life.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the ceilings and used to ask for the old sportspersons who had their families and those sportspersons who used to pay their bets to the poorest of the poor.
It would be like this to see the marvellous joy that the poor kids were enjoyed by watching Pella sports.
Millions of workers like me, who have been working on political thinking, have been working to interpret the political thinking, the political aspect of Indias roots, the ideals that have tried to reward the cultural heritage of India, the only human philosophy that Pandit Deendayal ji's martyrdom is being started today.
Public Grievances: The responsibility of Sarvajan Sukhai Antyodaya is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the people of Hawada.
How can the fruits of development be achieved by the poor man
He had given the entire economic work to every household, water to every field, in two words.
We can liberate the country from poverty only when the country celebrates their centenary year as a poor welfare year, the governments of the society and the people of the society get focused on the benefits of development.
As a part of this, where the Prime Minister's residence and the path that was known as the Rescuers Road of the current British, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay has been named as the Lok Kalyan Marg for centenary year.
This centenary year's poor welfare is a symbolic form of the year.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijaya Dashmi, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
I have been making a commendable effort in this regard that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to guide those government works.
How has the people of this country been inspiring me
This is the hopes and aspirations of the common man of the country .
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the beneficiaries for the manner in which Mann Ki Baat appreciated the manner in which he had improved his blessings.
I also express my gratitude to the Akashwani who has made a decent efforts to spread these things not only to me but also to deliver it to all the languages.
I also express my gratitude to the countrymen who wrote the letters after Mann Ki Baat, informed the government and highlighted the government's errors and Akashwani made a glimpse of the problems by calling the government representatives on these letters.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not only a message of 15-20 minutes but also a new opportunity for social transformation.
What else can be the reason of satisfaction greater than this for anyone
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja next week, the festival of Vijaya Dashmi, the preparation of Deepawali are a different kind of atmosphere in the entire country.
It is a festival of possible synthesis and the unity of society is possible in the country.
Then it is a Navaratri, how can the festival of the worship of Durga Puja, the worship of that saint and the unity of the society be celebrated
How to make the festival associated with humanity .
And when we become the means of realisation, we can celebrate victory by gathering together.
Come, let us take the mantra of unity.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 28 August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, tomorrow is the birth anniversary of Hockey's magician Dhyanchand Ji.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I salute Dhyan Chand ji and I also recall his contribution to you on this occasion.
He played an important role in giving Hockey Golden Centre to India in 128, in 132, in 136 Olympic Games.
We also know the name of cricket lovers and breadmen.
He said, "He is a living example of Goal Like Rans, Dhyanchandji Sportsman Spirit and Deshbhakit.
Once during a meeting in Kolkata, an anti-Team player hockeyed Dhyanchand ji's head.
At that time, only 10 minutes were left to complete the match.
And Dhyanchand ji had made three rounds in ten minutes and said that I had turned back the wound.
But I saw that this time, everybody called upon me to talk about Rio Olympics.
I look forward to such an attachment to the Rio Olympics of the common citizens, such awakening and pressurizing the country's big Prime Minister to say something on this.
Besides cricket, India has so much affection for citizens and sports.
Reading this message for me has also become a cause of great inspiration in itself.
A Sriman Ajit Singh has written on the Narendra Modi App. Please call the girls on their participation in education and sports in Mann Ki Baat this time, because they have glorified the country by winning medals in Rio Olympics.
Any Shriman says that you are instructed to mention Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
These daughters brought the luminaries that we got.
Our daughters once again proved that they do not descend from anywhere.
These daughters are from North India, then from South India, and from East India.
Someone is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of entire India have strived to make the country proud.
Summit on May Goa has written that we could have performed well in Olympics.
He has written, Hon'ble Modi sir, the first two medals we won in Riya, but I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, was our performance really good
And the answer is: No.
We need to cut a lot of distance in sports.
Our parents still ask to pay attention to reading.
Even today, sports is considered to be the width of time in the society.
We need to change this idea.
The society needs inspiration.
Thus, thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
No one can deny that we cannot exhibit our hope.
It was also happening that the exhibition that our players used to play in India could not even reach the sports here.
And only two medals can be found in the motto.
But it is also true that even if you don't get the lunar, then for the first time in many sports, the players of India have shown great skills.
But why can we forget that she is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics and for the Olympics Final
Something similar happened in the text of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babur made a cool breeze for the track fild file.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, women hockey team reached the Olympics.
Indias players, the coming time will definitely be good for us.
Many players, such as Ajiti Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal and Atnu Das are many names.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do what we have done then we will be re-expected.
I have announced a committee.
We will create a work map of how we can do better.
Think about how Rajya chooses one or two games and makes it an excellent performance in it.
I also invite the sports-social associations that they can also be neutralized.
And I urge every citizen of India to send a message on the Narendra Modi App that those who are interested in it.
Write to the government.
Association will discuss and give its invitation to the government.
The State Governments will discuss and send their suggestions.
But we are fully prepared and I am confident that we have to move ahead with the determination that 65 percent of our countrymen are younger.
My dear countrymen, this is the Teacher's Day on 5th September.
I have been spending a lot of time with students on Teachers Day for many years.
But if we want to go to the G-20 Summit for this time, then I am happy that today I will express my emotions in my heart.
As much as the mother's place in life is of teachers and we have seen teachers who are more concerned about their students than themselves.
He dedicates his life for his disciples, for his students.
Nowadays, after Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichandra is being discussed.
He is a sportsperson but he is a good teacher and has presented an example of this.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on Teacher's Day, I congratulate Pullela Gopichand ji for his penance, his dedication to sports and his way to enjoy the success of my students.
Teacher's contribution to our friendly life is always felt.
Former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnan Ji and the country calls it Teachers Day.
He may have reached anywhere in his life but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only that, he always used to say that good teachers are those whose students inside never die.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has shown such a marvellous life to live as a teacher and to keep an inner student alive in terms of being a teacher.
I think that I remember many things of my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
But today I can say with joy that even though one of my teachers is now 0 years old, his letter comes to me every month.
Because of this, even if I see somebody's good letters then there is a lot of respect in my heart.
It is our responsibility to grow the pride of our teachers in society.
If you have any inspirational talk with your teachers, your photographs and your teachers on the Narendra Modi App.
See, it is also valuable to see the contribution of the teacher in the country from the eyes of students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesha Festival will come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a learner and we all want that our country, our society, our family and every person's life remain uninterrupted.
But as we talk of the Ganesh Festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak Ji.
The tradition of Public Ganesh Festival is a gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now, not only Maharashtra but also in every corner of India, public Ganesh Festival has started to take place.
Establishes competitions and colourful competitions.
The exhibitions that are also showcasing the issues touching the society in a very artistic manner.
This massive campaign of public education runs through the Ganesh Festival.
Surajya is our birth-sufficient authority, now we move towards Surajya, Surajya becomes our priority - cannot we recommend this mantra through the Public Ganesh Festival
Come, let me invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are possible for the society.
This time, many people have also sent me a lot of writing the Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Why do not you use the statue of Ganesha built with the soil of the village pond
The idols made of POP are not unfair to the environment.
The protection of the environment, the protection of our rivers and streams, the protection of these small organisms from the pollution caused by it is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is a scholar.
We should not make such a Ganesh ji who creates a law.
I don't know how you will take these things, but I don't just say this, many people say and I have heard about many - one idolater is Shriman Abhijit Ghondfla.
An unfair Ganesh festival to the environment - this is also a social service.
Durga Puja is still time.
Now we decide that the old family that makes the statues.
If the statue is purchased from them then they will also get employment and if these statues are made from the pond or the soil of the river then they will be found again.
I wish you all the best for the Ganesha festival.
My dear countrymen, India-Ratn Mother Teresa will be celebrated on the 4th of September by the Saints.
Madhur Teresa dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when the mother Teresa, who served the poor people of India throughout their lives, gets the title of saints.
In the event that will be held on September 4, the Government of India will also send a seventy-seven-year delegation under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj.
From the saints, from the sages, from the great men, we have to learn something or the other every moment.
Let us continue to achieve something, learn something and keep doing something better.
My dear countrymen, how much change comes when development becomes a mass movement.
Jansh Kitt is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India has made a successful effort to connect people with the help of five state governments, for clean Ganga and for clean Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, the Sarpanches of the village that had come across the Ganges in Allahabad were invited.
The village will not let the Ganga river be dirty and no one came from Uttarakhand for this imagination.
Someone came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody from Bihar, somebody from Jharkhand, some from West Bengal.
I congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India, and thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in the sanitation of the Ganga by linking the peoples power.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me sometimes and those who are imagined, they also have special respect in my heart.
On 15th July, more than seventeen school students in Kabir Dham district have written a letter to their parents in a collective manner.
This was done by children from seven to seven years of age.
Congratulations to those students who made this effort and especially congratulated the parents who decided to make their children's letters seriously to toilets.
There are things that inspire us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, a 16-year-old daughter Malamma respected Satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become a dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have been resolved.
Some Indians have made it their target.
But everybody is associated with it in some form and everybody is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about how new efforts are being made.
There has been an idea in the Government of India and has urged people to make a film of two minutes and three minutes on cleanliness and this Short Film sent to the Government of India.
You will get the details on the website.
The competition will be held and the victory on the day of Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
I also call upon the channels to compete for such films.
creativity - creativity can also give a strength to the cleanliness drive.
New ways will be learned, new inspiration will be achieved and all this will be done by the common artists from the participation of Jantar Mantar.
It is not necessary that there should be big studios and good cameras to make the film.
A very important thing has happened in the past.
Our respected President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitri Channel - now some people will have to inaugurate a radio chain
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So, on this side, the Akashwani friendship and on the other side, Bangladesh Betar will share their mutual commodities and both the Bangladeshi people will enjoy Akashwani.
I also thank the Bangladeshi people that they joined us for this work.
I congratulate the friends of Akashwani that they are also contributing to the foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even if you have given me the task of a big Prime Minister, then I consider it as yours.
And sometimes all the incidents touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also give new energy and inspire new inspirations, which inspire the people of Barath to do something.
In the past, I got a letter that touched my heart.
A mother of about 84 years, who is a retired teacher, wrote to me this letter.
If he had never persuaded me to declare his name in this letter then today I would have spoken with his name.
In the letter, he wrote that when you had requested to leave gas subsidy, I had left the subsidy and then I had forgotten it.
You must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives will go to Rubru.
My efforts are to write a letter to more than one crore people.
He wrote a letter to me that you are doing well and the campaign to liberate the poor mothers from the humiliation of the election is better and I am a retired teacher.
The question is not of fifty thousand rupees but of the mother's passion and it is the blessings of such Kotikoti Maa Baheno, which gives me trust and strength for the future of my country.
I salute those mothers and salute those daughters of India who always wish for someone by suffering themselves.
My dear countrymen, last year we were suffering from misery, but this last month was constantly filled with floods.
There were floods in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the local NGOs, the social institutions and the citizens could do whatever they could.
But among the news of this flood there were also some news which had to be remembered more.
The next month of this year will be remembered for the strength of unity and how big results can be achieved by walking together.
In August 2016, many parties of the country, including nearly 0 parties, members of the entire country, all of these political parties, together crossed the GST bond.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country spoke of Kashmir in a single voice in respect of the situation of Kashmir.
If it has to be said in the shortest words, I will say that unity and mumta - these two things have been in the original mantra, and we all have the opinion of 125 crore countrymen, from the village Sarpanch to the elderly, if anyone dies in Kashmir, then he is a young man or a security worker, this loss belongs to our own people, it belongs to our country, those who are trying to contribute further to Kashmir, they will have to let the innocent children go.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
It is the responsibility of all of us as a citizen to tied up the country with diversity, as a society and as a government to give more emphasis on the strength of unity and to bring it out, only then will the country create a bright future.
My sages are confident of the potential of millions of people.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Today morning, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi and I am sure that in the days to come, the color of sports will enhance every young man in the country.
We all know that in a few days, the greatest sports events in the world are going to be hosted.
The word Rio will repeat in our ears.
The whole world will be playing.
Every country in the world will keep an eye on the performance of its sportspersons.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much but those who have played in Riya are working to increase the enthusiasm of the sportspersons.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India organised the Rain for Rio, Khelo and Geo, Khelo and Khelo.
We all do something for the promotion of our sportspersons in the coming days.
There is no desire for food, but everything has to be left.
Even if there is a sweet humidity in the winter, one has to leave the bed and flee to the ground and not only to the player but also to his parents.
Sportspersons don't get overnight.
I am also ready to do this work from you.
The country is ready to become a major postman to deliver your messages to these players.
Let us glorify every player in the days to come.
And today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem lover of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay has sent a poem.
Maybe there will be many other poets who have sent poems, maybe they will write poems but some will also make them self-confidence.
Technologies are changing every day, they form new forms everyday, they are changing everyday.
You cannot catch technology.
If there is no research and innovation then the way the damsel water spreads dirt, technology becomes even worse.
And if we continue to live without research and innovation, we will become out of the changing era in the world tomorrow and therefore in the new generation we have to create a sense of research and innovation towards science.
The NITI Aayog is promoting Atal Innovation Mission.
One goal is to create an eco-system, innovation, experiment, antar-prenciple, and to enhance the scope of new employment through the AIM.
Similarly, innovation has a direct connection with the Incubation Centre.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then the government has also thought of giving a huge amount of Rs. 10 crore.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We face problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And by Atal Grand Challenge, the young generation of the country has been invited to find, research and innovate with the help of technology to solve the problems faced by you.
The Government of India invites special rewards to the technology that has been searched for solving our problems.
And I am happy that when we talked about the Textile Lab, about thirteen thousand schools have served and when we talk about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand educational and non-educational institutions have come forward for the Incubation Centre.
I am confident that Abdul Kalam ji will work as much as our new generation for simplifying the problems of research, innovation and simplification of our daily life.
My dear countrymen, some time back we were worrying about the drought and now we are also enjoying the rains and news of floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Union Government are working together to help the flood victims in accordance with their efforts.
Everybody's minds, everybody's mind gets confused due to some problems due to rain, because the centre of our entire economic activity lies in the rains.
Sometimes there is a disease that keeps us busy throughout the life.
But if we are aware, be cautious and tried then the way to avoid it is also very easy.
Leave the dengue.
Dengue can be avoided.
Take care of cleanliness, be careful and try to stay safe, pay special attention to the children and it is thoughtful that such a disease occurs in the poor population but the case of dengue does not come.
Dengue comes first in happy prosperous areas and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen the public news on TV but sometimes we are very sad to take care of it.
The government, the hospital and the doctor - they will do their jobs but we will also not enter the dengue in our homes, in our regions, in our family and will be cautious of the disease caused by water.
I want to take care of you, dear countrymen, towards another problem.
Life has become so busy and has become so busy that we never have time to think for us.
If you have fallen sick then you feel that you are recovering at the earliest and for this we take any antibiotic and take it to the body.
But the bacteria that are present in them are tied up with these medicines and then medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria and then they spend years fighting, creating new medicines, scientific discovery etc. and till then these diseases create new problems.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing about such changes in itself that there is no effect on the medicines.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic respiratory systems and therefore the rules of using antibiotics are necessary.
When it comes to health, I ask for one more thing.
However, in the last one decade, the maternal corpus death rate has decreased, but still a large number of pregnant mothers cannot be saved.
During pregnancy or deficiency of blood, infection related to pregnancy, HyBP, it is not known when its life is ruined.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, free checks will be conducted at all pregnant women's health centres every month on 9th.
Can my doctor brother and sister not give this work for the poor for twelve days in a year
In the past several letters have been written to me.
Thousands of doctors have moved ahead with my point of view.
But India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should join this campaign.
I am confident that you will definitely add it.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is very concerned about the challenges of climate change, global warming and environment.
Its concern is collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized for centuries in India.
During the war of Kurukshetra, Lord Shri Krishna also discusses the tree.
In the Gita, Lord Shri Krishna says, "Swath: Sarva Vrikshana" means I sat in all the trees.
In the Shukracharya policy, it has been said that there is no medicinal properties in the vegetation that has no medicinal properties.
The Anushashan Parva of Mahabharata - There is a lot of discussion in it and it has been said that the trees which are planted are according to the trees.
There is no doubt.
Those who donate trees, they also strive in parallel to the trees like children.
Just a few days ago, one daughter of Pune, Sonal, was found to have touched my heart.
It is said in the Anushaasan Parva of Mahabharata that the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the children in Paralok.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, married his grandson Sonal in a very inspiring way.
And when I saw his explanation in the social media, it was surprising that there were no animals in the wedding but the plants were seen all around.
The sight of Tasvir was heart touching.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an incomplete story of nature and I extend my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatrejee for this innovative endeavor.
And many people use this.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims visit the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrava.
And I would like to tell them that if you look at this mother-in-law's palace then you will be blessed by mother-in-law.
And lakhs of pilgrims used to come and lakhs of plants were distributed this year.
The temples can also start the tradition of planting instead of prasad in this rainy season .
There can be a simple mass movement - plantation.
I have repeatedly told the farmer brothers that if we make our land barbarous on the banks of our fields, why don't we afford Timber instead of that harvest
If we plant trees beside our fields that are furniture and homework, then it can also be cut and sold after fifteen-twenty years with the approval of the government.
And you can also become a new source of income and India can also be saved by visiting the Timber.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan - Desert - He has done such a big festival and has resolved to plant around 50 lakh plants.
Fifty lakh plants are not small in Rajasthan.
The people who know the land of Rajasthan know how big a beacon has been raised.
We have resolved to increase our green cover by 50 percent.
The Central Government has launched the Green India Mission, under which the Railways have swiftly worked.
Gujarat is also a very exciting tradition of the Forest Festival.
This year, many projects like Amruvan, Ekta Van, Shaheed Van in Gujarat have been taken up as a forest festival and have launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they are also eligible for congratulations.
But for me the journey of South Africa was a way of pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When this word of non-violence, love and forgiveness falls in the world, Gandhiji and Mandela are swimming in their faces.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited Finics Satellitement, which is known as Mahatma Gandhi's residence.
I was also fortunate to visit the train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that had planted a mohandas to become Mahatma Gandhi, the Peter Maritsburg Station.
But this time I got the opportunity to meet such dignitaries who hosted their lives for equality and equal opportunity.
He had spent his life with Nelson Mandela in jail for twenty-twenty-twenty years.
In a way, he honoured the entire youth and I am fortunate to see the glorious feelings of Shriman Ahmad Kathada, the friend of Nelshan Mandela, Shriman Lalu Cheba, Shriman George Bezori, Roni Kasarils.
The symptoms of the duties mentioned in the Gita were absolutely true.
My heart will remember that visit forever.
Equality and equal opportunity cannot be a greater mantra for any society and government.
The priority will be different but the path is the same and that path is development, equality, equality, equality, equality and equality.
Come, let us proud of our Indians who have also shown the basic mantras of our lives in South Africa.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Verma.
That those who have conveyed to me and their concerns are very natural.
I am sorry to be a woman for her family.
And some people are illusioned and stuck in the face of money.
A new way of robbing this technology is spreading around the world.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a few moments, he realized that everything has been looted.
But recently I felt a pleasant feeling.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
The artistic pictures are drawn at the station.
If you also go to Aligarh then definitely look at the station .
Today, I am receiving such news from several railway stations in India and local people are presenting their areas on the walls of the railway stations by their art.
An innovation is being felt.
This is an example of how the changes can come from the people's participation.
Congratulations to all those who do this kind of work in the country, my colleagues of Aligarh.
And you must also be associated with the festival even at home and outside.
We have a special significance in the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Like last year, cannot you give a huge Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of our country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Think, give him such gifts that they are really safeguarded in life.
And today is social security.
Today is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born after Independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in independent India.
The entire country will be painted in the color of freedom fighters, the fragrance of freedom will once again be felt all of us and the Freedom Festival should not be the programme of the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you will do something related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Whatever you want, your words should also be kept in such a bright way from the Red Fort.
Nowadays, the platform of technology is so easy that you can easily send things to me.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everyone makes several programs in the holidays.
And in the holidays, orange is also seasoned, so it feels like enjoying orange.
And sometimes it feels that if you get a chance to sleep for some time in the afternoon then it will be better.
But the extreme heat of this time has spoiled all the fun around.
But I have seen that citizens also make great efforts.
In many villages, awareness is seen and what is the value of water is those who are suffering from water.
And that is why there is also a sensitivity about water at such places and there is also the activeness of doing something or the other.
Just a few days ago, somebody had told me that the city of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra has taken the water as a very sensitive question of the village.
The crops which used to be the most water, the sugarcane, the bananas and the crops have been decided to leave the farming.
It looks very simple to hear, but it is not so easy.
And all of them went on the farming of gardens and vegetables which require minimum water.
He has taken all the initiatives like Fountains, Drip Erigation-Tapksinching, Rainwater storage, water conservation, that today the village has grown up on its own strength to meet the constraints of water.
It is true that even though I talk about a small village in the market, there will be many such villages.
I also thank all such villagers for their best work.
Someone told me that there is a Gorava Gram Panchayat in Dewas district in Madhya Pradesh.
The Panchayat has driven a campaign to build swords by making efforts.
Although the water remains survivors, but as water falls on the surface, the quality of water also improves.
Sometimes it seems that when the Government of India brought water to Latur by train, it became a news for the world.
It is true that the people of Pella village are eligible for the same congratulations that the railways have done this thing at a fast pace.
I will say that more than the railways are congratulating.
But many such schemes which are run by the citizens are never similar.
It is the nature of the person, however many problems can be overcome, but whenever good news comes, it feels like the entire crisis has gone away.
This year, the possibility of rainfall from 106 per cent to 110 per cent has been announced, as if a message of great peace has come to light.
Now it is time for rain to come but good rain news has also brought a new warning.
It provides an opportunity to all of us as much as the news gives us enjoyment as well as challenges.
Can we run a campaign to save the water from the village
Farmers need soil and those crops are used in the fields.
This time why do not we take out the soil from the ponds of the village and take it to the fields
This will improve the field land and also increase the water conservation capacity of the ponds.
Sometimes in the cement bags, sometimes in the empty bags of fertilizers, stones and soil, the water coming from where there is a path to water can be stopped or not
If the water stops for five days, it stops for seven days then the water will come down in the ground and the water will be lifted in the ground.
There will be water in our wells.
Water should be stopped as much as possible.
Today, even if there is a crisis of water, there is a situation of drought, but we have time for the next one and a half months.
And I always say that whenever we go to the birthplace of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, there is also a place where we see how two hundred years old toilets have been constructed under the house to save rain water and how much water remains pure in it.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Many governments have come up with several schemes, several schemes have been spent, therefore it is very natural to raise these questions in the minds of crores of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna.
Ganga Mokshayani is for those who are religiously devoted.
I will accept this Mahatma, but more than that, I feel that the Ganga is life-saving.
Ganga gives us a new strength to live.
Just like the Ganges flows and gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
We have brought the Ganges to a bhagirath but to save crores of thousands of devotees.
This work cannot be successful without a public participation.
And that is why we all have to reiterate the fact that for cleanliness, for cleanliness and for transformation.
Many efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from the states that are situated on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organizations too.
Several steps have been taken to stop the dream and industrial pollution of Patna.
Everyday, a large number of canals are flown through dense waste and drained inside the Ganges.
In order to clean such waste, Trash Skimmer works to clean the swimming waste in water at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
These machines have been distributed to all the local NGOs and have been requested to run them continuously and clean garbage from there.
And in the past, I have been told that there is a lot of effort that is being made to remove waste from three to 11 tons daily.
The garbage or black liquid coming out of the pulp and paper industry is almost completely closed.
All these are indicatives that we are moving ahead in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person meets not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung south then he definitely says that if Saheb, Ganga will be cleaned
So, the people who believe in this thing will definitely succeed in cleaning the Ganges.
People are also giving donations for Ganga Swachhta.
This system is being run in a very good way.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Diwas in India.
Today, Panchayati Raj was started in our country.
And today, gradually, the Panchayati Raj system is working successfully as an important unit of our democratic system.
Therefore, in collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India launched the India campaign from 14th April to 24th April, 10th April.
And today on 24th, I will celebrate the Panchayati Raj Diwas in Jharkhand or where our maximum tribal brothers and sisters live.
And I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country once again on the occasion of Panchayati Raj.
This campaign has done a great job of awakening.
How can democratic institutions be strengthened at the level of the village in every corner of India
How can the villages themselves become self-reliant
How do the villages themselves plan for their development
The birthday of the daughter should be a festival of the village.
There are several such schemes.
In some villages, food donation programmes were organized.
Perhaps in all the villages of India, this kind of programme has been going on together for 10 days.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the Sarpanches of the villages for this.
In a very geographical way, with innovation, this entire opportunity has been transformed into an opportunity for the welfare of the village, for the development of the village and for the strengthening of democracy.
The awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of India.
Prime Minister's Office
I speak from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
I am a question about education in school colleges.
For the last several years, the need for improvement in education sector has been seen.
For example, lack of adequate schools or colleges or lack of quality in education.
Today, if parents have a first dream in every family then they are of good education for children.
The ideas come after the house, the car and everyone.
And this feeling of mass mind for a country like India is a great power.
There should be an increase in the worry about education and better education to save children.
And the children are also aware that I go to school for this work.
And that is why I would first appeal to all the girls and parents to talk to the child in detail about the activities being taken in the school.
And if something is noticed then go to school and talk to the teachers.
This technology can also reduce many evils from our education system.
So, in a way, the effort to spread education all around was the priority.
And that was also necessary.
But more important is the improvement in our education than the importance of spreading.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
We have to make good education a priority from the literacy campaign.
Entry, Entrance and Entrance Mantras continued to shout, but now the children who have reached school will have to concentrate on good education, proper education.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize good education.
But Sharmila ji is true that we need to improve the possibilities.
You must have seen this time in the budget that the cheese has been cut off and worked.
In the Budget, ten Government Universities and ten private universities have been asked to be free from government closures and to come on the path of challenge, let us tell you what you want to be the highest university.
The scheme has been implemented with the intention of providing full freedom to them.
Universities of India can also become global competition units.
The more important is education, the more important is skills.
Similarly, technology will play a very important role in education.
Different distance education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I am confident that in a very close future, the results will be seen.
People have been asking me on one subject for a long time.
Some people write on the web portal My Gov.
Some people write me on the Narendra Modi App, and most of these youngsters write.
In today's era, sports is also very important for the youth as well as for the youth.
So one day I also met that I will interact with you all before that.
The result was that I just called a meeting in which NCCs were elders, NSS was elders, Scouts and Guides were from Red Cross, Neru was from the Youth Centre.
And when I asked him when I met him earlier, he said that my brothers and sisters, this kind of first meeting has been held after our country was freed.
And I also believe that these organisations should provide a new life and create a new power.
This time I have put some topics against them.
I have told them, brothers and sisters, why shouldn't our youth, all the organizations do a great job of water conservation in this season
Which such programs can be constructed to connect the country
What can be the common youth songs of all our organizations
What new things can be added to their work style and programme
If you write on my Narendra Modi app, then I will deliver it to the right place.
Such a situation will be created.
My dear countrymen, I have told you that today we are compelled to think of it.
I also look at it as a shocking thing to the people.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that in the last few elections, how many side gas cylinders would be given
And every political party felt that if it is possible to reach the middle class society, it is a big problem of gas bottles.
On the other hand, the economists used to pressurize them to reduce the subsidy.
And there were several committees that had a huge demand for reducing gas subsidy, and suggestions were made.
Crores of rupees were spent behind these committees.
But the thing used to stay there.
This experience is for everyone.
But it was never thought out of it.
My countrymen, today I am happy to announce that I have adopted the third path.
One crore families voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy layer.
But it was learned that more than 80 percent of these crore families were those who opened the seller there, grew up in lines and in writing, they supplied themselves.
This incident has forced the economists of the country to think newly.
And if this happens to the world's economy then it will be the result of this kind of economic equation.
And for them, this is the outcome of their ideas and sometimes they have to think about it.
I specially appeal to the entire political class today that we need one thing that trusts the people everywhere.
You would never have thought that this kind of results would be available to us.
And we should go in this direction.
Please trust those who are sending the marks by giving their tests.
Sometimes I feel that we can make some announcements that there will be no ticket chakra in the route that the railway pays today.
Every braking news is bad news in every newspaper and news channel.
Is not there any improvement near us in the country with a population of Rs . 2500 crores
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that only positive news is printed on the first leg of the paper.
They used to talk about this continuously.
A few days ago, he also wrote a letter to me. He said, We have decided that on Monday we will not give any negative news.
This is the biggest reason for inspiration to improve good news.
However, it is true that as much as we emphasize goodness, the place for evils will be reduced automatically.
If the lamps are lighted then the darkness will be removed and it will happen.
You can also contribute to it.
Rabi Ji has made a good announcement but please don't regret me.
We all try to compete together and try to speak positively.
The speciality of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh can also be a center of attraction for tourism.
Very few people of the world will know that for such a long time, crores of people come to the bank of the river.
For the last two days, I have been witnessing that many people are uploading the details of the Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India to compete with the tourism department of the state government.
Photos competition and people ask you to upload beautiful photographs.
And people will also know how much diversity is being faced in the corner of the Kumbh.
So it can be done.
Jews, it is true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and he used to say that we have given special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that cleanliness is there.
From there people also take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh may be a religious and spiritual fair, but we can also make it a social opportunity.
We should also use this Kumbh Mela in the message of water conservation, how this Kumbh Mela will increase the love for water, how it will increase the belief of water.
My dear countrymen, I am going to meet you once again in the evening on this important day of Panchayati Raj.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You will remember that last time I had discussed a book of Premchand ji's narratives and we had decided that whatever book we read, we will share some things with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was watching that a large number of people have shared information about several books.
I am happy that people are discussing and discussing the books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyle.
Okay, I will talk to you about some other books.
But I have to accept one thing that now I cannot give much time to read books.
But one of the benefits is that I am getting the opportunity to know about several books that you have written and sent.
But from the experience of the past month, I feel that we have to move ahead.
Why should we create a permanent Book coorner on the Narendra ModiApp And whenever we read new books, write and discuss it there.
And you can also inform the best name for this Book coorner.
I want this Book's Coorner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
You keep reading, write and share it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
There are several effective efforts in water conservation across the country.
People have already told about traditional methods and methods.
The media is also proud of many new swings on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, all the wars are doing something or the other.
It is heartening to see the potential of collectiveness, it is very satisfying.
As far away from Ranchi in Jharkhand, the enthusiasm that the villagers have shown about water conservation has become an example for everyone.
You will also be happy to know that Ishaan Bharat's beautiful state Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to prepare its water policy-water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the crop farming is encouraged which requires less water and the farmers are also not harmed.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for interacting with the farmers and inspiring them for less water harvesting from traditional farming.
The time has come for the festivals.
Many fairs are also organized on the occasion of festivals.
Why don't we use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some of the things in our lives give us a new energy, especially the achievements of children, their activities, and that is why today I want to talk about some children and these children are: Nedhi Baipottu, Monish Joshi, Danshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Prati Nag, Arthurva Deshmukh, Arunitesh Ganguly and Haritik Ala-Manda.
Whatever I say about them, you will also be proud and zealous.
We all know that cancer is a word with which the whole world is scared.
It seems that these ten children are standing on the entrance of death, but not only have they defeated a fatal disease like cancer in their lives, but have brightened the name of India in the whole world with their perseverance.
In fact, the World Childrens Winners Games was organised in Moscow this month.
This is a unique sports event in which the Young Cancer Service (Yang Cancer Service) or those who have been fighting cancer in their lives are participating.
Competitions like shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and table tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won the moon in this tournament.
Some of them won the sportspersons in more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that you must have been proud of the success of India in space, across the sky.
Sanjay Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga, Kolkata, P.
Aurobindorao, from different parts of the country, many people have written me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged them to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, the perspective of space was very good for India.
Our scientists had left A-SAT in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
There was not much talk of big and important news like A-SAT at that time in the election rally.
We had the potential to break the satellite at a distance of three hundred kilometers in just three minutes from A-SAT missile.
India, achieving this achievement, became the fourth country in the world and now on 22nd July, the entire country was proudly seen that Chandrayaan-2 took its steps from Sriharikota to space.
But if you ask me what two big challenges have been received from Chandrayaan-2, then I will say that these two are- Feath and Firelessness, that is, respect and fearlessness.
We should be dependent on our talents and capacities, we should have faith in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely in Indian colour.
It is Indian as a purpose and feeling.
It is completely an indigenous mission.
The way our scientists launched the Chandrayaan-Both by addressing all the technical problems by simultaneously working day and night, it is unprecedented.
The entire world saw this great penance of scientists.
We have to face temporary setbacks or temporary problems in our lives, but always remember that we have the power to overcome them.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
Finally, science is the path of development.
Now we look forward to awaiting the month of September when the level of the moon will be transformed into Lander Vikram and Rover Pragyan.
Today through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the students of the country along with the young friends and invite the youngsters of the country for a quiz competition.
These quiz competitions will be the main subjects of space sciences, Indias space mission, science and technology, like what to do for planting rockets.
How satellites are installed in the room and what information we get from satellites, what happens to A-SAT is a lot of things.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this quiz competition and make them enjoyable, interesting and memorable with my participation.
I urge schools, colleges, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their schools victorious.
The most thrilling thing is to encourage all the students to join it is that the Government of India will take the highest quality students from each state to Sriharikota at their costs and in September, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment that Chandrayaan is descending on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event of their lives for these victorious students.
But for this, you will have to take part in the quiz competition, you will have to achieve the highest mark, you will have to win.
Friends, you must have lost my suggestions.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
The words of our minds have accelerated the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and the efforts made for sanitation have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, which started five years ago today, is creating new standards for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved ideal conditions in cleanliness, but the way the cleanliness drive has been achieved from ODF to public places is the strength of the determination of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen, but we do not have to stop it.
This movement is now moving towards the beauty of cleanliness.
Just a few days back, I was watching the message of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is the engineer of the army and has left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother Bharati.
He said that a few days ago, the fear of making Delhi clean is not only speedy but it is also very fast.
He started with his team with the rubbishes of Lodhi Garden.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated and decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of over bridges and schools to the huts, they started decorating their towns, people got together and this sequence started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street painting during Kumbh.
I know that brother Yogesh Saini and his team played a very important role in this.
Whether there is any sound in the colors and lines, but the message of the indiscriminate manufactured by it proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also realize this in the beauty of the cleanliness mission.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making the West to Wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making the waste a waste.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting pledge on MyGov.
This comment was from the brother Mohammed Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He added: "Mann Ki Baat" programme is like to be heard.
I am happy to note that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility programme-Back to Village in my state, Jammu and Kashmir.
The programme was organised in June.
I think such programs should be organized every three months.
At the same time, there should be online monitoring of the program.
I think that was the first such event in which the people interacted directly with the government.
After reading the message sent by brother Mohammed Aslam ji, my enthusiasm to know about the Back to Village programme increased and when I got to know from the area, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
The people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic it is.
The programme lasted for weeks and in almost four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state government officials informed the people of the village about the area of government schemes and programmes.
How to strengthen Panchayats
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of the common man
Friends, It was not just impossible for the program that the officers would return to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in Panchayat, which gave them the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added several other things to make the program enjoyable.
Under Khelo India, sports competitions were organized for children.
Further, Sports Kitts, Manrega's job cards and SC-ST certificates were also shared.
The people of Kashmir became participants in this festival of development.
It is a matter of great pleasure that the Back to Willage programme was also organised in remote villages where government officials had to travel on a day and a half-day walk through remote roads.
These officers also reached the border panchayats, which are always in the border areas of the border, and also in the areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag where the officers reached without any fear.
Some officers were so impressed with their welcome that they stayed in the village for more than two days.
Such programmes and the participation of the people in this show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want good governance, it also proves that the strength of development is always heavy on the strength of the Bomb-Bandook.
It is clear that those who seek to spread hatred in the path of development can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra has presented the glory of the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he said... that is, the composition of rainwater and the stream of water is unique and the earth is immersed in its beauty.
In the entire India, people of different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Shravan as their own.
Whenever we look around us in this season, it seems as if the earth has covered the green sheet.
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of the brother and sister.
You will be happy to know that this time most of the devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
Since 1st July, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
In 2015, more than the number of pilgrims who had participated in the 60-day journey, this time only 28 days have been included.
I also congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey become a fan of the spirit of zeal and spirit of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham since the four Dham Yatra has been started this year in Uttarakhand.
After the severe disaster in 2013, this number of pilgrims have reached there for the first time.
My brother has requested you to go to those parts of the country whose beauty glows a lot during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and tourism, perhaps no other teacher can be more than that.
My best wishes to you all that this beautiful and vibrant month of swamy is to transmit new energy, new hopes and new hopes in all of you.
Similarly, the month of August brings the memory of Bharat Leave.
However, when we look at the TV, we see the same aspect of rains - floods, floods, traffic jams on all sides.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am also concerned as much as you are concerned about the test of your children.
But if we change our way of seeing the test, then perhaps we can get anxiety free.
In my last Mann Ki Baat, I am happy to note that you have your experience on the Narendra Modi App.
The teachers, who have been successful in doing business, have sent me a lot of things by the parents and some thinkers of the society.
I will also talk about what I have read and what I have been told.
I am happy to note that I am indeed amongst you.
I would like to tell you the messages they have sent to the Indians who are proud of...
You must work but make a real achieved goal for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was playing cricket, I also had many expectations.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
So I thought I would expect a vote and fulfill my goal.
But it is fulfilling my goal and fulfilling it, then I am doing something good for the country.
And I always tried to achieve this goal.
My focus was on the words and the goals were gradually achieved.
I would like to tell you that your thoughts are very positive.
Why competing
Why not competition
Why should we work hard to compete with others
Why don't we compete with us
Why don't we decide to break all our old records
You people, you will not be able to stop moving ahead.
And when you break your old records, you will have a satisfaction for happiness and satisfaction, no one will expect it.
Friends, Do not consider examination as a game of statistics.
Don't stay stuck in the accounts of those who reached the catalo.
Life should be linked with a great objective.
We should walk with our dreams and should be determined.
Whether we are going to be right or not, our speed is correct or not.
And that is why if the dreams are huge, the test will become a joyful festival.
Each exam will be a step to fulfil this great objective.
Every success will be a key to achieving that great objective.
And for this reason, do not be limited to what will happen in this year's examination.
Take a very big goal and if it is less than expected then it will not be depressed.
And there will be a lot of strength to make efforts.
Thousands of people have written to me a small phone call on my app.
Shreyan Gupta has emphasized that the healthy mind remains in the healthy body.
Students, take care of your studies as well as your health so that you can write well in the examination.
Now today, I don't want to say that you should start a discussion on the last day and go to run three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that in the days of examination, how is your daily life
Our 365 days of our daily life should be in line with our dreams and commitments.
I salute Shriman Prabhakar Reddy ji, who has requested him to sleep on time and revision on whale in the morning.
One should reach the test centre by taking the entrance and other things before time.
This has been done by Prabhakar Reddy Ji. Maybe I do not have the courage to say because I am a little sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends also complain that you sleep very little.
And this is possible.
We are not talking about sleeping.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if there is a slight problem in our body .
Not only this, our daily routine is also lost.
And that is why we don't consider any cheese as small.
You are not able to get yourself in the habit of compromising with the guys who are determined.
Make sure you look at it.
Friends, Sometimes I have seen that the students who go for examination have two kinds of students.
You must have seen these two types of students.
If anyone can do this better than me, then he is among those who have mastered it and those who have checked the world's largest players.
The Champion of Tewa Chase, Vishwanathan, will express his happiness.
Come, let us learn from them how to check in this examination.
Hello, I will inaugurate my speech by commemorating my best wishes for the first time.
I will talk about my tests and experiences.
Observations are like problems in life later.
When you play, you dont know what tiredness will come now, even in classes, you do not know what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, you are healthy and have sufficient sleep then you will get the correct answer that will give you the brain.
Therefore, stay quiet.
Do not put too much pressure on yourself, do not keep too much expectations, it is very important.
See it as a challenge. I recall what I have suffered during the year, I can create problems.
In the last minute, the things that you don't really remember, pass through important things.
Some questions you can remember with teachers or students, which will help you in writing in the examination.
If you repeat the difficult questions then it will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write it well in the examination.
Therefore, be quiet, take a lot of sleep, don't feel very confident and don't get depressed, initially I can cross these tests successfully.
Therefore, keep complete faith in yourself.
Vishwanathan Anand has actually spoken very importantly.
Sometimes we used to listen to the impact of Arjun's life.
Your heart cannot be calm if you are pushing books in the last minute.
Have a lot of laughing, keep on talking to friends, you see, the atmosphere of peace will be created by them.
You can imagine that you grow up on a pond, and beneath the pond are beautiful things.
But if suddenly someone throws stones in water and melts in water then what will be the beautiful things that were seen in the lake
If the water is peaceful then things are not so deep that they are seen.
But if the water is disturbed then nothing can be seen below.
And I feel that if I don't feel slightly light then I will feel good.
So I have developed my own technology.
Maybe it is my experience that you will also be benefitted.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
He writes on my app: We have experienced slightness with friends, family members every day, and my father has said this very important thing because most of us want us to know how wrong we have done when we come here with an exam.
We are stuck in it.
Friends, do not do this.
Just come out of it and spend half an hour .
Rajat ji is really like understanding.
While interacting with him in the present context, Ramcharitmanas, he is trying to reach this culture of the country and the world.
Such devotee Muraribabu has also sent a very important drop to the students.
And he is also a teacher, a thinker and that is why he has a mixture of butter.
I feel that we can be very happy and happy to accept the situation.
In your exam, if you go ahead with stressless and happy mind, you will definitely get success and even if success is not achieved, the galaxy will not be lost and the pride of success will also be achieved.
I also express my gratitude to Pujayshree Muraribabu, who gave us a good message.
Friends, Today I want to tell you another thing.
I am seeing that this time, those who have told me their experiences have definitely discussed Yoga.
Friends, Today I will make it clear that if you start doing yoga from tomorrow morning then it will be wrong with you.
But it is true that Yoga is a big challenge in the development journey of space.
There is a simple key.
Look, if you can.
I am very confident about it.
This is not the case.
But if we read the suggestions then perhaps we coup ourselves that yes, yes, well, let me go like this.
And I would like to invite you that even if you go to it for five minutes, you must read the suggestions.
The first time I read it, I felt that it doesn't come to me, but when I read the same thing again, I noticed that no questions have been asked otherwise, but that is what I don't understand the questions.
Rao, he stressed on courage.
In very few words, a very good message has been given to all students.
Let us listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
It is from Bangalore to C.
En.
R.
Raw says.
I believe that it is natural to worry about exams.
And this is also a competitive test.
Don't worry, you do well.
I say the same to my young friends.
Always remember that there are many opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees you also have the right to be here .
You must have strength, determination and penance.
With such quality, you will be successful in every test and other efforts.
Goodblace, how is it a scientific way
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
This is what they have spoken - Nishtani, Tapni - Dedication, Determination, Diligence.
If you are busy then you will also be afraid.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do good work.
Now a message has been given about the experience of the right-wing exam on my app.
He said that there is a continuous effort to create a positive environment during the examinations in his family.
It is true that Sachinji also said and positive approach, positive frame of mind.
We read in our curriculum about Thomas Elva Addition, the discovery of electric rounds.
But friends have thought of how many years they took to do this work. How many times they have been finished, how much money has been spent, how much disappointment has been made due to failure.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates our lives.
It is said that the possibility of success is hidden in failure too.
Who does not know Shrinivas Ramanujan
Their formal education did not include the topics of counting, but they did not have any special training.
But he contributed deeply in various sectors such as methemetical analysis, number theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved at any time.
The Hairy Potter Category is popular all over the world today, but it was not like that in the beginning.
They had to face many difficulties.
Rolling said that in difficulties, he used to work with full energy which was indeed important for him.
Today, the examination is not just for the students but for the entire thoughts and for the entire school and the teacher.
But it is not good for the students to be alone without the guys and teachers.
If there is a teacher or a lawyer or a senior student then the examination becomes easier by making a team together and going forward in a similar way by becoming a unit.
Shriman Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App. He has complained that parents should never pressurize them to bring more marks on their children.
They should be encouraged only to prepare.
If the child is talking to his friend then do not stop him.
Make a light environment, create a positive environment, your daughter or daughter, see how many confederations come.
You can also see these coffins.
Friends, One thing is certain, especially I want to tell my young friends, the life of our people has changed much more than our old generations.
Every minute new discovery, new technology and science can be seen as a colourful colour.
And that is not just what we feel.
We also like to join it. We also want to move ahead with the speed of science.
I am doing this because today is the National Science Day.
The country's Science Festival is celebrated as National Science Day on 28th February.
28 February, 128 Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery of the Raman effect.
He received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country celebrates on 28th February as National Day.
The curiosity is from the people of science.
And without science and technology, new discovery is not possible.
Today, on National Science Day, the emphasis is on innovative research in the country.
Knowledge and technology should be the simplest part of our development journey.
This time, the theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Drive Innovations.
Friends, sometimes successes are achieved after a long time and when success is achieved, the vision of the world changes.
If you are very busy in exams, then you might have been able to note a lot of news in your mind.
But I want to tell the countrymen again.
You must have heard that there has been a very big and important discovery in the world of science.
The scientists of the world laboured, generations came and did something and almost a hundred years later, a success was achieved.
It was our scientists that the discovery of the Gravitational Waves emerged.
This discovery is a far-reaching achievement of science.
This discovery not only authenticates the theory of our great scientists in the past century but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire humanity will be used for the entire world.
But as an Indian, we are happy to note that our country's sons were associated with the honourable scientists in the process of entire research.
Our scientists will continue to move forward in the future too.
India will also become a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, we have made an important decision in the past.
In order to achieve greater success in this discovery, the government has decided to open it in India in the Laser International-Wave Observatory Tunnel.
The combination of India will provide a new energy and a new momentum to this process.
India will surely become an active partner in this great scientific research process of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again I warn all the scientists and greet them.
From tomorrow, you can listen to my 'Mann Ki Baat' by doing a mess call on that number.
You will also be able to hear in your mother tongue.
The number of messocolates is 8108-8108 and I say again.
81908-81908 lists, your exams are being started.
Hey, my brother is a budget tomorrow.
On the occasion of Param Diwas, we all celebrated Christmas and now preparations for the new year are going on.
India is full of diversity.
In a way every festival waits for another festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where it is a traditional economy.
This becomes the reason for the economic activity of the poor people of the society.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Christmas (Natal) and many congratulations on the new year of 2016.
The year 2016 will bring you a lot of happiness.
The new zeal, new enthusiasm and new resolve will bring you to a new height.
Shri Ganesh V.
Savelishvarkar has written to me that this season is the season of tourists.
A large number of tourists from the country and abroad come.
People also go to celebrate the holidays of Natal.
The more clean our tourist destinations will be the image of India in the world.
I welcome the thoughts of Ganesh Ji and I am conveying the message of Ganesh Ji to the countrymen.
However, we say guest Dev Bhav. We have to visit a guest.
And, at our tourist destinations, on our visits, indeed, this is a special emphasis on our tourist destination.
He is an ordinary worker and works hard, works hard.
He has done such a wonderful thing that he has often published his message.
And when I got this thing in my mind, I felt that I had brought it to you.
In Bhojpura, he has made 100 toilets so far by considering that this work is a sacred task without labour.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we listen to the depression of the country.
And this is the thing that pushes the country forward and then it is very natural for him to take dignity for Dilip Singh in Mann Ki Baat.
The result of the intense efforts of many people is that the country is moving forward very fast.
75 crore countrymen are moving forward in one foot and are also moving forward in the country.
Besides, new opportunities for education, better skills and employment.
It is a big task to provide simple credit under the Mudra Yojana to the people of the ordinary family who cannot reach the windows of the bank.
Who can forget the relevance of Yashoda Mata and Krishna when Balkrishna opened his mouth and visited the entire universe to Lord Yashoda.
The event of Yoga has contributed to India.
The talk of cleanliness is swinging in the house in a way.
The participation of the citizens is also increasing.
After all the years of independence, the villages which have access to electricity cannot be imagined by the extent to which the zeal and emergence of the villages gets lost by the darkness can hardly be imagined by the people living in cities.
But I am confident that the media will definitely reach such villages and the biggest benefit will be that the employees of the government who are doing this will be so satisfied that they have done something that will bring about a change in the lives of any village.
Whether it is a farmer or a poor man or a young man or a woman or not, should all these services reach or not
Therefore, it should not be possible to see what government has done and what government has not worked.
But it should be ensured that if they are enthusiastic then do not let them go.
Should they also get information for their rights
We all should try that the true thing, the good thing, the human beings, the more people can reach.
This is also the work of service.
I have also made a small effort to do this thing in my way.
I can't do anything alone.
But should I do some of what I am doing
A common citizen can also connect with me by downloading the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone.
And I keep sharing such small things on it.
And it is a matter of joy for me that people also tell me a lot.
How can I reach without your help
Come, let us all talk about the interests of the common man, in the language of the common man and inspire them to get their goods.
This was followed by all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India will launch the entire Action Plan of Start-up India, Stand-up India.
And in this programme, IIT, IIM, Central Universities, NITs and youngsters from all over the country will be connected by the Live-Connectivity.
Be it digital world or IT profession, this startup is for them.
Yes, we have to bring about changes in the requirements of India.
The market will be available.
Similarly, is the intellectual property of our young age limited to some cities
This thinking is wrong.
The youngsters have talent in the corners of India, the Chem should get the opportunity.
This startup should not be limited to some cities of India, Stand up India.
And I also appeal to the state governments that we should take this forward.
On 16th January, I will urgently interact with you in detail and will always be acceptable to your suggestions.
Friends, The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanand Ji is on 12th January.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekananda Ji.
On 15th to 12th January, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival.
This year, it is scheduled to be held in Rampur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January.
And I have come to know that this time their theme is because their organisation is based on theme, that theme is very good, the Indian Youth: Development Skill and Harmony, I have been told that more than 10,000 youth from all the treasuries of India are going to be gathered.
The sight of young India is to be decorated.
In a way, the dreams have to be fulfilled.
Concept is to be realized.
Can you inform me about this young festival
I specially invite young friends that I am the Narendra Modi app.
So I would like to wait for you to know your thoughts about the Youth Festival on the Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan of Ahmedabad Gujarat, who is a Visually Challenged Teacher, celebrated the Academic India Day at his school.
He has expressed his feelings by calling me, sir, and academic India humble in my school.
We enjoyed the school and encouraged children to help the disabled in the society.
I think you were the first to do it.
Thank you very much.
And you are working in this sector yourself.
You understand these things very well and if you give it then there will be many problems.
Sometimes there is a chance to meet such a person in the society and some thoughts come in our minds.
We also express our vision to visit them according to our thinking.
And many words have been used in the world for such people, but there has always been contempt towards words.
Every time people feel that they don't like identifying this word, it doesn't seem proud.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I had to go to that programme.
However, in some districts of Tamil Nadu and especially in those areas, I had not been able to attend the programme on that day.
But he had to go to the program, he used to keep some thoughts in my mind.
So at that time I had come to my mind that those who have lost their lives, those who have lost their lives, those who have lost their lives, those who have lost their lives, those who have been working properly, those who are also called disabled and are also known as disabled.
But whenever we come to their familiarity, it is known that we see a lack of their eyes, but God has given them some special results.
After that my thoughts came to my mind that we feel that he is a disabled person, but it feels that he has an extra power special.
And when I went, I realized that why not use the word Disability instead of the disabled in our country
These are those people who have such an organ that there is one or another organ in which there is a sense of divineness, the communication of the Divine Shakti, which is not with the ordinary body.
I like this word.
Our countrymen, can we popularize the habit of divyang instead of disability
I am confident that you will take this forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, it will make it easier for the people of the Disabled by improving the physical and indirect interface in both ways.
Whether it is a school, a bus station or a railway station, it has a ramp, easy parking, easy lift, braille lip.
In order to simplify their availability, we need innovative searches, technology, systems and sensitivity.
We have taken the responsibility of this task.
Peoples participation is also being received.
Those files should not have die.
In the past, the Government of India has made an effort to achieve the benefits of the schemes easily.
In our country, gas cylinders are subsidized.
The government made some changes in this.
Benefit Transfer Scheme is the worlds largest, the largest, the largest, the largest, the largest banking bank account of the beneficiaries.
The scheme is known by the name of the first and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore cooking gases have become beneficiaries of the first scheme.
14 crore people have started going straight into the bank account.
No intermediaries, no recommendations, no possibility of misconduct.
On the one hand, the campaign of Aadhaar cards, on the other hand opening of Jan Dhan accounts, on the third hand, the Government of India and the Government of India together prepare a list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiaries account through various schemes.
I am confident that around 35 to 40 projects are being directly covered under the Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, a golden moment of the Republic of India on 26th January is also a pleasant coincidence that this time the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
There was also a special discussion on the constitution of two days in Parliament and it was very good.
All the parties discussed the importance of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the correct understanding of the Constitution etc.
We should take this forward.
Can the reproductive day connect the people with the system in true sense
Our constitution gives us a lot of authority and the official is discussed in a social way and should also be there.
But the Constitution also emphasizes the duty and duty.
But it has been observed that the discussion of duty is very low.
Whenever elections are held, there are public news all around, it is written on the walls, hoardings are placed that voting is our sacred duty.
At the time of voting, there is a lot of talk of frustration, but why not even talk about frustration in social life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, can we celebrate on 26th January, in schools, colleges, in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, organisations, competition, poetry competition, vocationalism etc.
If one hundred and fifty crore countrymen go through the duties of duty then how much history can be created
Can you send me that
I want to know your thoughts.
Send it to me at my portal Maya Gov.
I would like to know exactly what do you think of the youth duties of my country
There is a need to make a small suggestion.
On 26th January, when we celebrate the Republic Day, we have the idols of great men in our city by the citizens, by the children of school colleges.
And I am not saying this for the sake of government.
As a society, as a country, can we make it our simplicity
On 26th January, we all try to glorify the statues of such great men, the cleanliness, the premises and all this can be done easily by the people and the citizens.
Ladies and Gentlemen, once again many good wishes for the New Year 2016.
There must have been an opportunity to go.
And trade has also been started with new zeal and enthusiasm.
On the other hand, the preparations for Christmas would have been started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
There is constant news of natural calamities from every corner of the world and it has never been heard that it is not thought that there is news of natural calamities.
People are also feeling how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
Many people have died.
I express my condolences to all those families in this hour of confusion.
The State Governments are able to work with full potential to save relief.
The central government is always working with a betrayal.
Now a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But as we want to talk about hatred all around, we need to make a lot of changes.
Even today, 15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the agriculture sector because at that time more and more natural calamities were limited to drought.
Today, its form has changed.
At every level, we have become very important to work for our capacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens and every small institution will have to work in a very scientific manner to build capacity.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had spoken to Pakistan Chief Minister, Shri Nawaz Sharif.
And I had suggested that we should jointly make a joint venture for the prediction of the disaster.
I am glad that a tablet of SAARC countries exercises and best practices were completed in Delhi.
A good start.
Today, I got the phone call from Jalandhar, Punjab.
(Yes, I speak from Jalandhar, Punjab district.
We make organic farming here and guide many people.
I am very happy to hear your message.
Moreover, you are aware of the problem of farmers.
And your concern is true, but this is not the case only in Punjab Haryana.
This is our habit in the whole of India and in a traditional way we walk on the path to burn the remains of our crops.
But the pain you have expressed is true.
The first solution is to teach our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves are a biological fertilizer.
We put a widfying on it.
Moreover, if its small pieces are cut then it becomes dry fruit for animals.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the ground is burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a moment, think that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidneys should be good, but if the upper skin of the body burns then what will happen
Heart cannot live even if it continues.
The upper layer of our soil burns, which pushes our fertile land to death.
And therefore, we should make positive efforts.
Once again, this thunderstorm is buried in the ground, it becomes bitter.
Otherwise, if a piece of saliva is poured in a bay then it becomes a good type of organic fertilizer.
And our land is also saved, not only that, if we put the fertilizer produced in the land then it benefits twice.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who made agriculture.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier, he used to cultivate bananas and if the banana crops were finished then he had to spend Rs. 5,10,15,000 per hectare to clean it.
And as long as the people who picked up the trekker-backer were not brought, they used to lie like that.
But some farmers have proved that they have broken six-six-eight-eight-inch pieces of this piece of piece of piece and buried them on the ground.
The water that is in the thunder keeps the crop alive.
Dear Countrymen, on December 3, the world will remember International Day of Persons with DC Ability.
Last time I had discussed my part donations in my heart.
Helpline of My Noto for Organ Donation was also discussed.
Indian Organ Donation Day was held on 2nd November.
Several well-known people including film actress Ravina Tandon joined it.
Organ donation can save valued lives.
When the organs go from one body to another then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life .
I am confident that there will also be widespread awareness in this sector and in the true sense, the needy will get better help because no one can get this help until they get it from anyone else.
I said earlier and on December 3, it is celebrated as a disabled day.
Physically and mentally handicapped persons also have an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes there is pain when they are joking.
Sometimes the feelings of compassion and mercy are expressed.
But if we change our vision and change our vision towards them then these people can inspire us to live.
Something can inspire you to get rid of.
We start crying even if there is a small problem.
Then it is remembered that my problem is very small, how do they feel
And therefore, these are the source of inspiration for us.
Their lifestyle is commendable to transform the way and contradiction with their life.
Jawed Ahmad, I want to talk to him today.
40-42 years old.
In 16th century, Jawade Ahmed was shot by the traitors in Kashmir.
The ability to live on his feet has always gone, but Javed Ahmed has not been defeated.
They couldn't even defeat the wounds of treason.
The body does not support, but for twenty years they have been drowned in the study of children.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for handicapped people in government offices at public places
They are working on it.
He also turned his studies into this direction.
He got Master Degree in social work and became the messenger of the disabled as an awakening citizen.
Is it not enough for us to inspire Jawadez's life in every corner of India
I specially remember Jawed Ahmad's life on December 3, his penance and his dedication.
In the absence of time, even though I speak of Javed, the lamps of such inspiration are spreading in every corner of India.
A new light of life is spreading, showing ways.
There is an opportunity to get inspiration from them by remembering all of them on December 3.
Whether it is a middle class person or a lower middle class person, a poor person, a poor, a poor, afflicted, afflicted, deprived and deprived persons, they have to constantly maintain government arrangements with the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes sometimes somebody gets bad feelings from the government Babu.
And that only a bad experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout the life.
Many times we do not even know because it is so simple that we dont know that any government system, any government servant is doing this thing.
Asha workers in our country who are networks across the country.
We have never heard of discussions about ASHA workers amongst the people of India.
But, as the World Heritage Family Enterprises of the Bill Gates Foundation, his success in the world has become a vision.
When we had conveyed Padma Vibhushan to both these Bill Gates and Millinda Gates.
He works very socially in India.
Whatever he earns, the time of his retirement and life is being used for the work of the poor.
In the last days, the Government of Odisha has honoured a hope worker on Independence Day.
On the basis of the primary arrangements they have been taught, they should be taken up for treatment.
Emphasis on every household using insecticides.
Just as your child sleeps well and as much as care should be taken, Asha Varkar Jamuna Mani Singh is working with full dedication to save the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he fought against malaria and prepared to meet the entire village.
If you come then how much money will be there.
How many lakhs people will be around us.
We will look at them with pride.
Such people become so much possible in our country.
How many big brothers of the sadness of the society become
I salute all such hope workers through Jamunamani.
About the inspirational events of an e-book Swachh Bharat, the ideals of the Parliament, about the rural and health sector.
I urge you to look at it.
Not only this, show others too.
Read it and maybe you will feel like adding such things.
So you must migov.
Please send in.
Such things do not come very fast in our minds, but it is true for the society.
The positive potential is the largest energy.
You should also share the best events.
So you can actually become a social teacher.
The Earth's temperature should not be increased anymore.
It is also the responsibility of everyone, it is also the concern.
And it is the first way to save the temperature.
14 December is the National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Bulb schemes are underway.
I once said that on the night of the full moon, one should bath in the full moonlight by blinding the lights of the cerebral lights of the ceiling.
He should experience the light of the moon.
Some friend had sent a link to me and I got the opportunity to see it.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur doesn't seem to have been lucky to learn more.
But they are doing a job that perhaps no one thinks.
He is working to provide light to the poor by using solar energy.
He has created a committee of women and has established a platform of Fans running with solar energy.
And he pays a loan of Rs. 100 per month.
People take the fun in the evening and come back in the morning and give it for charging.
I have heard that 5000 households come.
Now see what the world's largest people will do for climate change, but a noorjee is inspiring everyone.
And Noorjahan means to publish the world.
He is spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Nurjahan and congratulate GTV because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the nation and the world.
Thank you very much.
I have received a phone call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh.
We ask from the elderly Prime Minister to know that in what way are these mudra banks going on , the adventures like us are helped .
MUDRA encourages traders.
Mudra creates affordable opportunities.
And the mudra empowers in true sense.
This mudra scheme is going on to help small adventures.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginnings are good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that there are about 24 lakh women in 66 lakhs.
And most of these helpers are those of the SC, ST and OBCs who try to run their families with respect to their own hard work.
Abhishek himself has spoken about his enthusiasm.
There are many news coming to me.
Someone has just told me that there is a challenge in Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, he received a loan of Rs. 8.
He started the business of Suez Dress Safai.
During my cleanliness drive, I said that cleanliness drive is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhonsle did it.
They have brought a tank and they have been working and I have been told that in such a short time they have paid Rs. 2 lakhs to the bank.
This is the objective of our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier he used to get more money.
And earlier, due to the reasons and other reasons, the money that was spent was now being spent in their hands has started saving more than one thousand rupees per month.
And a good profession of his family also started growing slowly.
But I would like the scheme to be more propagated.
All our banks become more sensitive and help more and more small people.
Indeed, these people run the country's economy.
Only those who do small jobs are the economic potential of the country.
We also ask for emphasis on this.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Sardar Patel Jayanti, I had talked about an India, an excellent India.
These are the things that should be constantly awakened in social life.
What should be the structure of the program
What is Logo
How to increase public participation
I had said for all these suggestions.
I was told that many suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
I expect a lot of chocolate schemes.
And I have been told that the participants have to get the certificates.
Any major schemes have been announced.
You can also show your creative mind.
How to make this mantra of unity integrity a mantra of unity, an India, an excellent India, a mantra of connecting this mantra to an Indian.
Whether it is life-loving or glorious or life-loving or easy to connect everyone, what do the government do
What does society do
What does civil society do
There can be many things.
I am confident that your suggestions will be useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter has come.
I would urge you to keep your body healthy for some time to use this good season for exercise and yoga.
And create an environment in the family, there is a festival of the family, one hour is to do all this together.
You can see how consciousness comes and how much the body gives the whole day.
If there is a good weather then you will also get a good habit.
My best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind...
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you.
Once again, I have been fortunate to join you with my heart.
Today, the fifth day match between India and South Africa is going to be held in Mumbai.
This category has been named Gandhi-Mandella Category.
Therefore, the importance of the final match has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of Akashwani.
I would like that if such Akashwani centres across the country look at such aware and active people in the field of Petroleum then the objective of running the country will get a new strength.
Therefore, I congratulate all the colleagues of the Kannur Akashwani Centre.
Students from St. Mary Upper Primary School of Chittor have written a letter to me in Kerala.
The letters are special in many ways.
First of all, these children have made a picture of Mother India by marking their thumb.
The picture of the map of India has been sent to me.
Earlier, I was very surprised to know why he built the map of India with his thumb.
But when I read his letter, I understand how good resistance he has delivered.
These are the children who have tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is launching a public life campaign for organ donation.
He has also laid the foundation stone of the drama at several places so as to understand the contribution of people.
Organ donation becomes a trend and activity.
These kids have written to me in the letter that you appeal to people about your organ donation in your mind.
He says, Angan donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I have a lot of messages on the phone call.
Devesh ji of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
Every ten lakh person is a very fruitful step taken by the government towards the aspirational goal of donating organs.
I feel that this is very important.
More than two and a half lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in the country of 125 crore, we can only achieve only five thousand transplants.
Every year one lakh eyesight is required.
And we can only reach the caval forty five thousand.
We can only give one in front of the requirement of four eyes.
The princes have also tried to give guidance in this direction.
Some princes have tried their best to reduce the text and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront of organ donation.
Several social institutions and many voluntary institutions are doing well in this direction.
National Organ and Tessue Transplant Organization-NOTO has been set up to promote organ transplantation.
A helpline of 18001140 services is also available for 24 hours.
And we have been told there that Tektan Bhunjitha.
The excellent description of the pleasure of sacrifices is in the Mantra of Tekaten Bhunjitha.
Just a few days ago, we all saw on TV that Delhi's G.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Organ donations should be done by us to reflect the spirit of Tekaten Bhunjitha and we must give it a boost.
We have recently celebrated the festival of Navaratri and Vijaya Dashmi.
And a few days later, we will also celebrate Deepawali.
Eid is also celebrated by Ganesh Chaturthi.
The India-Africa Foreign Summit is being organised in New Delhi, the capital of India between 26th and 2nd October, 2018.
For the first time on the soil of India, such a large scale is being organized.
The leaders of the Choppen African countries and the United Nations have been invited.
Outside Africa, a packey conference of African countries is being organised.
The relationship between India and Africa is deep.
The population of India is as much as the population of African countries.
And if we meet both then we are the third part of the world.
And it says that lakhs of years ago this was the same land.
Later these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
Our good deeds are in the natural resources.
And about 2 lakh people of India have lived in this country for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural and political relations.
But India plays a very important role in training the youngsters of the most African countries.
More than 25 thousand African students are studying in India.
And today the leaders of many African countries are those who have read in India.
So we don't have so deep
And in that sense, the Summit is very important.
Generally, as the Summit is found, the heads of different countries are found.
Similarly, there is a meeting of the Chiefs at the Summit.
But it is our endeavour that there should be equality among the people.
About 1600 schools participated in this.
There were also schools outside India and India.
Thousands of schoolchildren have written a boost to India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition called 'Memories of Mahatma' from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is reaching Delhi from Porbandar on 2nd October.
Millions of children of the school witnessed the exhibition.
The people of the village saw how Mahatma Gandhi played an important role in the relations between Africa and India and how Mahatma Gandhi had an impact on both the landscapes.
The children of schools in our smaller spaces are also very excited, their vision is broad and their deepest thoughts are seen.
However, this Summit is of India-Africa but we can clearly see the opportunity to connect the people.
I congratulate all the children participating in the competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time I had made a proposal for the Parliament Adarsh Gram Yojana on 15th August.
After that, many MPs have supported this work.
He was very fond of it.
A workshop was organized in Bhopal last month.
Where the ideals are becoming villages, the Sarpanchs, the collectors there, some MPs there, the Government of India, the state government, all of them together discussed the issue of Adarshgram scheme.
Several new things have been taken into account and a lot of enthusiasm has been discovered.
I want to take some of these things into consideration.
Jharkhand is a very big state and tribal area.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to be an ideal village.
It was difficult for government employees to go there too.
I congratulate the respected Parliamentarian, Shriman Kriya Munda Ji.
And, in a way, the school provides education to children in the morning and to make children teachers in the evening.
And about five hundred fifty observers were fed by these children, they were reading and writing.
We can see how big a transformation can be brought from the will of the people through the village panchayat.
This village is well known for manufacturing of sugarcane and Kurtai jaggery in the state.
Shriman Ruwala ji inaugurated the Kurtayi Goal Sherdi Festival on 11th March in this village.
People of old public life also came here.
An exhibition was also organised to enhance the sale of sugarcane products.
He added that how to make the village a centre of economic activities, how to sell the products of the village.
Shriman Ruwala ji is actually congratulated for his efforts to build an ideal village as well as a self-reliant village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be a matter of mind and not a matter of cleanliness
Mumbai's Savita Rai has sent a message to me by telephone. "We clean our houses every year for the preparation of Diwali.
This Deepawali will make our homes clean and also the outer environment and maintain its cleanliness even after Diwali.
He has taken care of the truth.
My dear countrymen, last year, after the festivals of Diwali, our country, especially the media played a bigger humor and after Diwali, wherever the garbage was rubbished, she said that this is not good.
All the middlemen had launched a campaign for awakening.
And the result was that after Diwali, a cleanliness drive was launched.
So, Savita Ji is true that you should do the same thing as we are doing before the festival.
Every public event should be done.
And today, I especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I am fortunate to attend the cleanliness gathering organized by the India Today Group.
He gave Clean India Awards and I was also looking at how many activities are going on.
For this, however, people themselves are working as One Like One Mission.
How are the places that have been kept so clean in our country
All these things came to light and I thanked the commendable work of the Indian Tu De Group at that time.
Through e-TV, for the last one year, they have been encouraging cleanliness.
He has added more than 51 lakh children of about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana.
Whether it is a public place or station or a religious place or a hospital or a garden or a large campaign of cleanliness has been launched in many places.
Now this news shows itself the power to realize the dream of a Swachh Bharat.
The Mission Clean India is the hundreds of chains of our country, thousands of prints and I cannot take the name of all because of lack of time but everybody has launched this campaign.
Therefore, according to the suggestions made by Savita Raiji, today the entire country is accepting this thing and pushing it forward.
I have written a letter to my prince Shanmuganath from Meghalaya.
And through this letter, I have mentioned the village of Mavalyannong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years, this village has taken the challenge of cleanliness and almost every generation is completely dedicated to cleanliness.
And they say that a few years ago, they had received the reward of the cleanest village in Asia.
I am happy to hear that there is also a village in Meghalaya in the far-flung North East that has been in the field of cleanliness for years.
This has become a habit of the citizens and the culture of the village has become.
Just this is what makes us believe that our country will definitely become clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we can proudly say that Jews have liberated our mother India from dirt, my dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said that some things have been done by such a corruption house.
When the poor person goes for small jobs, he does not know how many problems he faces, how the money of the poor people gets stuck in their money.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who examines a person completely in a two-minute interview.
And I had announced this idea that why don't we ruin the interview system for small jobs
My dear young friends, today I am proud to say that the government has completed all the procedures and the central government's Group D Group C and Group B Non-Gazetted posts will no longer be taken into account.
The rules will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
We will not interfere in the ongoing process, but it will come into effect from January 1, 2016.
I wish you all the young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget we had announced an important scheme.
Sonny has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold is considered as a medium of economic security.
It is believed to be the keys of the nectar period.
This tradition has been going on for centuries throughout the society.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the gold bank and the bank will pay you interest on it.
Earlier we used to keep gold in the locker and we had to pay the locker.
Now I will put gold in the bank and the bank will give you money as a wage.
Speak, the countrymen can no longer become the wealth of gold
Whether gold can be converted into a living power or not from the dead coins .
Just this is what we have to do.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
Its safety and satisfaction. Two benefits.
Take sure advantage.
There is another scheme. Sovereign gold bonds don't have access to gold, but a paper comes.
But the price of this paper is almost the same as one gold. On the day when you return this paper, you will be paid the same amount of gold that day.
So we are starting these projects.
Therefore, we do not need to buy gold now.
So, this scheme with security guarantees will be presented to the countrymen next week.
I am happy to note that we are also bringing gold coins with Ashok Chakra.
Nearly 0 years of our independence, but we have been using foreign gold coins, or even gold boolean bars, or even around.
Why should not our country have indigenous marks
Therefore, in the coming weeks, more density will first come out and will be available to the common people from Dhanteras and Indian gold coins with Ashok Chakra of five grams and ten grams are being started.
Besides this, 20 grams of gold boolean will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new transformation in the direction of economic development and I will help you.
My dear countrymen, Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the birth anniversary of 31st October.
The map of Akhand Bharat emerges while remembering one India, the best India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
He has introduced his capabilities as Iron Man.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but he had the dream of uniting India, which he had done geographically, but this mantra of unity should always become the medium of our thinking, behavior and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Several sects, many sects, many sects, many tribes, many dresses, many possibilities, our country full of diversity, and this is the diversity of our splendor.
If there was no diversity, we might have been proud of the beauty that we couldn't take.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last few years, 31st October has been organised by Run for Unity programmes across the country.
I have heard that this time too, it is being organized all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for the race of unity.
The race of unity is a race of development in true sense.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a race of unity.
Let us pay tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Push the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I am going to visit Briton.
I am very excited about my visit to Briton this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such sections of society, whether it is a rebel or tribal or backward children who are going to learn abroad.
I am confident that when such children of India go to study in Britain, this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them.
And so I am saying that I am very excited about my visit to Britain.
And now that building is becoming the wealth of hundreds of crores of countrymen, with which the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar can be envisaged by the people like me.
I am going to get another opportunity in London and the unveiling of the statue of Lord Basweshwar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Basweshwar for democracy and women empowerment is indeed a studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of Lord Basweshwar's statue to the household of London is an excellent example of how many great men of India used to think about those centuries ago.
You know that when such incidents have been linked, the minds of all of us get thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, your letters are also discussed on the sky.
There is talk of calling the government officials.
Some people write their problems and also try to solve problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
However, a good thing has been tied up between us.
Last time I was completing one year.
Today we are entering the new year.
My best wishes to the countrymen once again.
Jai Hind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, greetings to you.
There is a fundamental idea in my life and because of this my immense belief on the strength of the people, but the word Mann Ki Baat has taught me what I have understood and I can say that more peoples power than we think.
Our ancestors used to say that Janta Janardan is a part of God.
I can tell my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that there is a great power in the thinking of our ancestors, it is a great truth because I have realized that I used to ask for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and every time I could talk about two or four suggestions but millions of people used to be active and inform me, this is a great power.
Yes, these lakhs of letters gave me a big message too.
Different departments of the government have analyzed public letters and what is the matter of policy and what is the personal question that is not in the minds of the government.
Who thought that the source of these information would be Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that Selfie With Doctor and the whole world were surprised.
Perhaps somebody in all the countries of the world has achieved the glory of Selfie With Doctors and daughters in lakhs.
And when he used to do Selfie With Doctor, he used to enhance his daughter's enthusiasm but also resisted himself.
Whenever people used to see, it seemed that the neglect towards the daughters would have to be neglected now.
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in mind the tourism of India, I told the same citizens that if you go to Incredible India or if you have any good experience then send it to me.
However, in the number of lakhs of people from every corner of India, the tourism department of the Government of India, the state government has never thought that we have such a beautiful heritage.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Is it not time to ask for ' Khadi for Fashion'
Today, I am very satisfying that in the last one year, the sale of manure has almost doubled, this work has not been done due to some government news.
On a TV channel, I saw that a retired teacher was standing in a widow lady line, to leave the subsidy.
The common middle class, the lower middle class, for which it is difficult to leave the subsidy, but these people have left.
Isn't this silent revolution
Have you not seen this manpower
The governments also have to learn that the work done in our government offices is a powerful, powerful and determined society of a larger mass democracies outside the gallery.
He made every small thing his own and tried to connect himself for the betterment of the country.
What can be greater satisfaction than this
In Mann Ki Baat this time I thought of doing a new experiment.
I had prayed to the citizens of the country to telephone your questions and reports.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a pleasant experience.
All the elderly people have conveyed the message.
I liked to hear some messages myself.
My team is working on the rest.
You might have taken a minute or two minutes but your phone call for me, your message is very important.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
But one thing was surprising for me and was joyful.
It seems as if there is negativeness all around and there is negativeness.
But my experience was different.
Thousands of people had spoken their own words.
But I am surprised that all things were similar in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat.
Completely positive, indicative, creative.
People have said that more than 0 percent of the remaining one energy-filling and enjoying things.
They must have heard radio.
I am aware of the importance of radio for the blind people.
I am seeing a new idea and have said such good things and these people and the government are also sufficient to sensitize them.
I have delivered this message from Alwar Rajasthan.
Listen, what they ask - Surely listen - my name is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
I am confident that like wind, your feelings will definitely reach every corner of India.
It has been suggested that the soil is not only rooted, but also the soil lamps are sufficient.
On the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, my dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers.
Whether it is our naval personnel, land, air force, Army, Air Force, Navy.
The war of 165 was completed with Pakistan for 50 years.
He has constructed a Shauryanjali exhibition near India Gate in Delhi.
If we learn a lot from the perspective of history and look for inspiration in life, perhaps there can be no greater inspiration to serve the motherland.
Whether the fight is from Hajipira or from the north, whether it is from Chamanda or Hajipira, it is thrilling to see the scenes of the wind and we are proud of our soldiers.
My visit to these brave families was also to meet the families of Balidan and those who participated in the war are now in the north-eastern part of life.
If you want to make history then it is important to understand history deeply.
I have come back in two and a half hours but you will definitely take three-four hours.
A small child has instructed the Prime Minister, but he has forgotten to call his name in a hurry.
We should also make the nature of cleanliness and make arrangements for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction with the message of this child.
I have to listen too.
I see the best thing that the Parliament of the country is also discussing Indias cleanliness.
And on the other hand, on the one hand, the Parliament and on the one hand the children of this country talk about cleanliness - what can be the fortune of the bigger country
The movement that is going on is the atmosphere of nefariousness towards dirt and awakening towards cleanliness. It will also despise the governments to work.
Even if there is a shortage, we have to move forward and in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say.
Once he said: If I want to choose one of the two independents and cleanliness, I would like to like cleanliness first, and after independence, it was more important for Gandhi to have cleanliness.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi has delivered a message on Maya Gave.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the life of great men always remains the cause of inspiration for us.
And it is not our task to assess the idea that the great man had done.
And you will find the name of some great man from the glimpse of history.
In the days to come, let us remember all these great men, let us deliver their message to the household and let us also try to learn something or the other.
I would like to invite you once again for 2nd October.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of the revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
I also said last year that you will have all kinds of fashion clothes, every kind of fabrics, several things but one Khadi should also have a place.
I once again say that from 2nd October to 1 month in Khadi.
Its benefits should be taken.
And handlooms should also be given equal importance along with khadi.
And therefore, in this Deepawali, we must give Khadi a place in our house and give it a place in our body.
And when we saw it, we almost doubled the sale.
How many poor people have benefited.
You have done the job that the government cannot do with the publicity of the unemployed.
This is the manpower and that is why I once again appeal to you for this work.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very happy with one thing.
You must also get some taste of this pleasure.
I had visited Kolkata in the month of May and had come to meet the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
His nephew Chandra Bose had organised everything.
I had the opportunity to spend a long time with the family of Subhash Babu.
You can imagine how happy moment will it be for me
The family members of Netaji may have come to visit the Prime Minister's residence for the first time in their lives.
But it is also a matter of great happiness for me that such hospitality has never come to the place of the Prime Minister's residence, which I am going to meet in October.
More than 50 people of Subhash Babu and the entire family live in different countries.
I got a message from Bharagvi Kande and listening to it, I felt like it would be a leather and perhaps it would be a leather.
My name is Bhargavi.
I would like to assure the elderly Prime Minister that you should awaken the younger generation about water registration so that in the coming days, the participation of the younger generation increases and in future, the government is being chosen and run.
Every voter is fortunate in the democracy and this awareness is growing gradually.
Some years ago, we used to see that our Election Commission has been working as a single controller, but in the last few years it has brought about a major change.
Today, our Election Commission has not only been a controller but has also become a facilitator in a way - a voter friend and in all its ideals, it has changed a lot.
The voter should continue to be upgraded and we should also keep cheating.
I am telling you during the election that after the first vote, water consumption was done.
Everyone should do the sacred work.
On the last day I visited Kashi.
I got a seventh standard student named Kshitij Pandey.
He is the seventh edition of the Central University at Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is of very strong intellect.
But I have seen his interest in the research of physics in such a young age.
How the sensitivities came in robots, what they were saying, it was very strange, brother.
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child .
How
When
These children should ask their minds.
Similarly, I had to meet a very small girl from Sonam Petal.
9 years old.
She is the daughter of a very poor family of Sadabriz Patel, a resident of Sunderpur, Varanasi, and I am surprised that the entire Gita is convinced of her.
But the biggest thing I felt was that when I asked him, he used to say, he used to define it, used to define it in English and used to define it in Hindi.
Only Geeta reads or else also reads .
If we take history then it is all face to face in the evening.
We all are surprised, how is it so talented in the entire family
I was really very impressed.
Some children are enjoying celebrity but Sonam had nothing like this.
Besides reading in the news papers, we do a lot of things and sometimes such things are also enjoyed.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that in Mann Ki Baat some people bring a lot of work for me.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
I have to work as much as I have to do once a month, the time has to be done so much.
Sometimes my colleagues of our Akashwani have to wait for half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
I am grateful to you for your suggestion.
Now it is just a month.
Mann Ki Baat has been completed one year.
Do you know how much used to use Subhas Babu radio
He started his radio from Germany and respected the citizens of India through continuous radio in respect of the freedom movement.
He launched the Azad Hind Radio from a weekly News Bulletin.
He used to run these radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto and Urdu all languages.
It has been a year since I was talking about Mann Ki Baat on Akashvani.
I am also talking about you and this is my satisfaction.
The next month we will meet again for Mann Ki Baat.
You keep sending instructions.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
The reforms begin.
Your contribution is valuable for me.
Once again, my best wishes to you all.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
Once again I have got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
People are celebrating Onam in remote areas and yesterday the whole country celebrated the sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan.
In collaboration with social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we will give this protection scheme to our sisters.
I am told that since the beginning of this scheme, 11 crore families have been associated with this scheme.
Moreover, I was also told that about half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider it a good sign.
I extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a large scale.
Whatever work has not happened for eighteen years will happen in such a short time that why
I also saw the poor.
We had to open accounts from zero balance.
But the poor saved the amount of Rs.
Young people have got jobs.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, one lakh gatherings of Financial Leaders Campaigns have been set up to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Only the accounts are not to be opened and stopped.
And now thousands of people have become officers to get overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And it was believed that the poor could get money from the bank.
I have brought it to you and it is your job to maintain it now.
All of us should be active.
I am confident that you will do that.
In the last few days, the incidents of Gujarat made the whole country bachelor.
But in a very short span of time, all my well-known civil brothers and sisters of Gujarat have taken care of the situation.
Before the situation worsened, he played an active role and once again walked on the path of Gujarat peace.
Peace, unity, brothers and sisters - this is the right path.
And we have to walk on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
There was an opportunity to listen to them.
And I am telling the truth that I got the opportunity to listen to them in a way as if some music was playing.
I was very happy.
Perhaps it has become the most important thing to realize the true nature of Islam in the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition, which is associated with love, is blessed with generosity, will bring this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also tell others that even if we believe in any sect, sometimes the Sufi tradition should be understood.
In the coming days, I am going to get more opportunity and I consider this invitation as my fortune.
In India, the scholars of the Buddhist tradition of many countries of the world are going to visit Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru visited Bodh Gaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these widows around the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you something specially today.
Earlier, I had mentioned this in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me in Parliament, you must have heard me in public meetings, you must have heard in Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I have been telling you that the Government is open to the debate about the land acquisition act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the benefit of the Kisans and I have been repeatedly saying that.
But today, my farmer brothers and sisters, I have to say that the reform of the Land Acquisition Act came through the states, it was insisted that if we want to do the work of the village, the poor farmers, the canals to provide water to the fields, the roads to the villages, the houses for the poor people, the system for the employment of the poor youth of the village, we have to leave the law from the election of this unemployed state.
And then there was a proposal for reform.
But I saw that so much fear was spread, the farmer was so frightened.
My farmer brothers and sisters, my farmer should not be illustrated or feared.
And I don't want to give any opportunity to anyone who fears and misleads the people.
We presented an ordinance.
Ordinances are scheduled to be completed on August 30, 2019.
And I have decided to let it end.
This means that the situation that was before my government was formed has now been re-established.
But one thing was incomplete.
And that is why we brought them to the Ordinances, but due to these disputes, the matter has also been lost.
And my farmer brothers and sisters, I assure you that Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan is not the slogan for us, it is our mantra.
The welfare of the village, the poor farmer.
Therefore, on August 15, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Welfare.
And when it comes to the war of 165, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
It is also natural to recall Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan mantra.
It is also very natural to remember the Tricolor Flag of India and all those martyrs who maintain their pride and pride.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 165 war.
I am happy that India is doing a very good job in many directions in science.
Our scientists are actually doing the best.
Now we have the opportunity to reach these researches to the masses .
How to transform principles into equipments
How to connect the lab with the land
It has to be pushed forward as an opportunity.
I got some new information.
I can say that it was also an extremely inspiring for me.
And when I had said last time in Mann Ki Baat, our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there is a lot of opportunity and there is a lot of potential.
I get many letters from the citizens.
We have written about skill development.
Shriman Prakash Tripathy has stressed the need for good teachers for primary education from Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu.
We have emphasized upon reforms in education sector.
I have also told my young friends one thing.
On 15th August, I had told the Red Fort that why the interview for the lower level job
And when the Interview calls, where will every poor family, widow and motivation be available
The poor will not have to run for implementation.
There will be no exploitation, no taxation.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially for the loss of maternal mortality and infant mortality, the call-to-extension has been reflected on the soil of India by twenty four countries of the world.
This was the first time in any other country outside the US.
However, there has been a lot of improvement.
India's praise at the international level, yet these figures are not small.
Just as we got rid of the police, we also got rid of the tetanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Today the news of dengue continues to come.
It is true that dengue is dangerous but it is very easy to save.
And it is directly connected with the Swachh Bharat that I am talking about.
We need advertising on TV.
There is widespread public education in this regard but we do not pay attention.
I would urge you all that we should not make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Being careful about water, sadness about sanitation - it is not true that it becomes the cause of death.
Dengue free check-up facilities are available at around five hundred Choud Centres across the country.
Cleanliness should be given a lot.
These days, there is a festival in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali in a way.
Why should not our every festival be joined with cleanliness now
You see, Sanskrit will become a habit
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, but in his heart, the spirit of service to the tribals of India is bright.
These two brothers have enhanced India's pride.
This year both the brothers won the race.
Indias honour increased.
I extend my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am extremely happy that his entire campaign is being done with the intention of redemption of Tim India Vision for Tribals.
See how every person is making efforts in the form of a self-sufficient country.
And that is why when we hear such incidents, the chest flourishes.
Sometimes because of perception, we commit injustice to our youngsters.
My experience in the youth is different.
Whenever we talk to the youth, we also learn a lot.
I have met many young people who say, "Brother, I have taken a pledge in my life that "Sande on Cycle".
Some people say that I am keeping a cycle-day on one day of the week.
Today, I especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now Babasaheb Ambedkar will be the magnificent, divine and inspirational memorial.
The memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar will now be an inspirational place for the Maharashtra government when Indians traveling around the world will go to London.
I extend my best wishes to the Government of Maharashtra for these two efforts to honor Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
After a long gap, once again, we are launching Mann Ki Baat, peoples talk, peoples talk and peoples talk.
In the light atmosphere, 130 crore people used to listen to, repeat and sometimes our words became inspiration for us.
You can imagine how this mid-term period might have gone.
Maybe it wasn't an uninterrupted program.
I was doing something missing every moment and when I am doing Mann Ki Baat, I am speaking, I am probably mine, but the story is yours, the Purusharth is yours, the record is yours.
I used to use my words and my words and because of this, I was not doing this thing, but you are doing it.
One was feeling indifference.
But this Sunday has a lot to wait.
Well, we have finally got the opportunity.
Mann Ki Baat, Small, Small, Social, Life, which is the cause of change in a family environment.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new feeling and in a way supports the spirit of a New India.
I feel myself.
Sometimes I feel that this is my journey of satisfaction.
This is a journey from my soul to my soul.
My close interaction with you was also part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people have asked me how I was going to Kedarnath in the race for the election.
Most people have drawn political meanings from it.
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
The rest is your curiosity, I think we will discuss it.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in the same way, your efforts to strengthen a positive thing, I am constantly feeling in your speeches.
The letters which are received for Mann Ki Baat are very different from the regular government functions.
Sometimes the task of pushing my thought process forward makes some of your words.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is also showing his neglect towards dirt but also explains the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone talks about the environment, he feels pain, but at the same time he also tells the experiments he has seen and also paints the thoughts he has in his mind.
That is, I am reflecting in your point of view how to solve problems in a way.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the country and society.
He shows us that there is no dearth of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It requires strengthening and inclusion of talent, giving opportunities and implementing it.
Mann Ki Baat also tells that all 130 crore countrymen in the development of the country want to connect with strength and proactiveness and I would definitely say one thing that in Mann Ki Baat I have so many letters, so much telephone calls, so much messages are received, but the elements of the complaint are very little and those who have asked for something, they have not come to me in the last five years.
When I analyze such things, you can imagine how much enjoyment my heart will be, how much energy will I get.
Accountability, I haven't come, you have brought me, you have settled me and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, we will move forward the line of Mann Ki Baat.
When the country was hampered, its opposition was not limited to the political sector, it was not limited to the politicians, the movement was not confined to the jail square.
There was an outrage in the hearts of the people.
There was a thirst for the lost democracy.
When we eat at the time of day and night, we do not know what hunger is, in the same way, what is the enjoyment of democratic rights in normal life, it is known when somebody snatches democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country had started feeling that something has been taken away in Katokati.
Perhaps everybody in any country of the world has voted not only for democracy but for the rest of their rights and requirements for democracy.
Recently, the Maha Parv of Democracy, a massive election campaign was organised in our country, from Amir to the poor, everybody was happy to make a difference to the future of our country.
Whenever any thing is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, its amazing effects are also ignored.
This number can seem very common to us, but if I say that if we leave a China then more than any country in India had voted.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost doubled.
The number of voters in India is more than the population of entire Europe.
This indicates the vastness and widespreadity of our democracy.
The election of the 2019 Lok Sabha was the world's largest democratic elections in history so far.
You can imagine how large quantity of resources and human power would have been required to complete such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees can be selected by day-to-day hard work.
In order to fulfil this greatness of democracy, where nearly 3 lakh security personnel of the paramilitary team took their responsibility, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also executed their efforts.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more votes have been made than the previous time.
You can imagine about 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 1 lakh VVPET machines across the country.
All this has been done so that it can be ensured that no voters are deprived of their voters.
Polling station was set up for only one female voter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel there for two-two days - this is the true respect of democracy.
The highest number of polling stations in the world are also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 1500 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides this, there is a more proud fact in this election.
Maybe for the first time in history that women have voted like men.
In this election, the percentage of votes for women and men was almost equal.
One more enthusiastic fact is that today the Record 8 is a female member in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and bow down to the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth many times that Books will not Books, I was insistent on giving books instead of flowers in welcoming.
Since then, people have started giving books to many places.
I am very happy that somebody has given me a book called Premchand Ki popular Kahaniya.
Though I couldn't get a long time, I got the opportunity to re-examine several times during my visit.
My heart was also touched by his narratives that express human condolences in a simple and simple language.
His text includes the feelings of the whole of India.
When I was reading his story of addiction, my heart used to go on the economic problems faced by the society.
I remember the days of my youth, how discussions were held on this subject by night and night.
This statement of the brother of the landlord, Ishwari, and the brave family of the poor, learns that if you don't care then the impact of the bad world will never be known.
The second time that touched my heart was Idgah.
The sensitivity of a child, the sensitivity of his grandmother, the sensitivity of such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his grandmother with a chipio from the fair, the human sensitivity is really at its peak.
In this context, a live picture of the problems faced by the poor farmer's life was seen.
Despite their crops being destroyed, the small farmers are happy that they will not have to sleep in the fields in the extreme cold.
Though this story is almost a century ago, its relevance is similar even today.
After reading it, I felt a different kind of experience.
When it is a matter of reading, in a media, I used to read about the letter library of Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village settled amidst the dense forests of Idukki.
Teacher P.
Chinnathampi, both of them have worked hard for this library.
There was also a time when books were brought here by tied in a potla and laid on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
Gujarat's Vanche Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment.
Every age group of millions participated in this campaign to read books.
During the time of Google Guru in today's digital world, I would also appeal to you to take some time to place books in your daily daily daily route.
You will really enjoy it and write it on the Narendra Modi App whichever books you read so that every source of Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the issues that are not only present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides the Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf, many people have written about the challenges related to water.
Water is very important in our culture.
Rigveda's 'Ap:Suktam' says that water is the source of life and energy.
Give your blessings like your mother, your blessings will be on us.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are affected every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water received from the rainy season is saved in our country.
Just 8 percent.
Now the time has come to solve this problem.
I am confident that like many other problems, we will also resolve this crisis with the strength of the people, with the strength of the people, with the strength of 1.
In keeping with the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country.
It will take decisions on every subject related to water at a fast pace.
Just a few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanches across the country, to the rural Prime Ministers.
I had written to the rural Prime Ministers that to save water, to save water, to save water drops and drops of rain, they will talk to the village council by sitting with the villagers.
I am glad that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month crores of people laboured in thousands of panchayats.
In villages and villages, people resolved to collect one-on-one drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat program, I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
My best wishes to every village Prime Minister and every Sarpanch for their activism.
There are several Sarpanches across the country who have taken up the fight for water conservation.
In a way, this opportunity of the entire village has become.
It seems that the people of the village are now engaged in the competition to build water temples in their villages.
As I said, a lot of positive results can be achieved in the collective effort.
There can be no formula for coming out of the water crisis across the country.
Several efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this.
But everyone's goal is the same, and it is to save water, water conserve.
The drainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
With this effort, water logging is getting rid of the problem.
The life of the people of the village is changing due to the construction of a tank in Thimipalli, Telangana.
There has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields in Kabirdham, Rajasthan.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working well on Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we work together and steadfastly, we can make the impossible possible.
When people join, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I request the countrymen 3.
My first request is: Just as the countrymen made cleanliness a mass movement, let us start a mass movement for water conservation.
We resolve to save every drop of water together and I am confident that water is the palace of God, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier it used to be said that iron becomes gold from the touch of Paras.
I say that water is transparent and a new life is created by touching water.
Start an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell them about the problems related to water, as well as spread water conservation measures.
I specially urge the people of different regions to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is a film industry or a sports sector or a media partner or a people associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, people who are narratives, every person should lead this movement in a way of self-reliance.
Make the society a place, connect society with the society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My second request is that many traditional methods have been used for the protection of water in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to the birthplace of Porbandar, the venerable Bapu, there is another house behind the house of Bapu, there is a 200-year-old water tank and even today there is water and there is a system of stopping rain water, then I always used to say that those who go to the Kirti Mandir should see this water tank.
Many such types of experiments will be at every place.
Come, let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and inspire people to save water.
You can share your content using JanShakti4JalShaktiHeshTeg.
My dear countrymen, I am also grateful to you for one thing and thank the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again, on Yoga Day, three-thirds of each family, four-four generations came together and celebrated Yoga Day.
Yoga Day is growing in the wake of awakening for health care.
Every corner of the world, if a Yoga lover welcomes it as soon as the sun rises, then it is a complete journey till the setting of the sun.
Perhaps there will be a place where there is humanity and not associated with Yoga, it has taken such a large form of Yoga.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to the Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from AC gyms to the ongoing desert, from the villages to the cities wherever possible, Yoga was done not only at all places but also collectively celestially.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers and well-known personalities of many countries of the world showed me how he celebrated Yoga in the country of Petroleum.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We are well aware that healthy and sensitive persons are required for the creation of a healthy society and Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
It was a matter of great satisfaction for me that the announcement of the Prime Ministers Awards for giving excellent contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga in the year 2019.
This award has been given to organizations across the globe about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several institutes and training courses or so many of the Ms.
Take the name of Antonietta Rozi, who started the Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
It is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a matter related to yoga then can Indians remain behind it
The Bihar Yoga College, Munger was also honored with the dedication of Yoga for the past several decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honored and he established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Both the dignitaries of Yoga and the honour of those who delivered the message of Yoga at home made this Yoga Day special.
It is a big journey for me to connect with your thoughts.
Let us continue to meet and talk.
Keep listening to your feelings, keep believing and understanding.
Sometimes he tried to live his feelings.
Keep getting your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Let us enjoy Mann Ki Baat and also fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India has lost her virtuous dreams.
We have sacrificed these valiant heroes for the protection of hundreds of crores of Indians.
Our brave sons had united day and night so that they could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the brave martyrs in Pulwama's treason, people and people across the country are shocked and angry.
The sensitivities of the martyrs and their families are overwhelmed.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who have saved their lives by protecting Mother India.
We all have to face the challenges faced by the nation by forgetting communalism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences, so that our steps against terrorism become even stronger than before.
Our armed forces have been continuously introducing unique courage and valour.
He has shown a wonderful ability to establish peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also been responding in their language.
It may have been noticed how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The army has resolved to destroy the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational matters of his family members have been brought out by the medium of broadcasting and strengthening the entire nation.
Ramniranji, father of Shaheed Ratna Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, inspires us all in this moment of sadness.
He said that he will also send his other daughters to fight against the enemies and go to fight themselves if needed.
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena Ji, wife of martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagat Singhpur, Odisha.
He has also sworn in to recruit one of his sons in the CRPF.
When Shaheed Vijay Soren's Parthiva Deh jumped into the Tricolor and reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his daughter-in-law said that I will also join the fountain.
The zeal of this Monsoon shows the feelings of one child in the entire country.
Such feelings are being seen in the house of our brave martyrs.
I urge the younger generation to know and understand the passions they have shown by these families.
We dont need to go towards the ancient event of history.
Shri Omkar Shettyji of Karnataka, who is flying on the Narendra Modi App, expressed his happiness over the formation of the National War Memorial (National War Memorial).
I was surprised and suffered that there was no National War Memorial in India.
This is a memorial that can save the bravery of the brave soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided that there should be a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, we will dedicate this National Army Memorial to our soldiers.
The country will make such a small effort to pay its loans.
Delhi's heart is that place where India and Amar Jawan Jyoti have come and just a little closer to it, this is a new memorial.
I am confident that we will be sure to go to any pilgrimage to visit the National Army Memorial for the countrymen.
This National Soldier Memorial reflects the gratitude of the nation towards those who sacrificed the highest after Independence.
The design of the memorial demonstrates the indomitable courage of our soldiers.
The martyrs of Amar Chakra reflect the immortality of the soldiers.
The second circulation is of Veerta Chakra, which expresses the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
Thereafter, there is a departure chakra.
These circulations showcase the sacrifices of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the best sacrificed soldiers for the country are written in golden letters.
After this, the defence cycle demonstrates security.
This circulation is marked by dense trees.
The National Soldiers Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come here to study their gratitude to learn about the great martyrs of the country.
Those who have neglected their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and develop.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country.
In the month of October last year, I was fortunate to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be gratitude to the men and women who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will definitely visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, my thousands of letters and comments are being read through different mediums for Mann Ki Baat.
This time when I was reading your comments, a very interesting drop of Atissa Mukhopadhaya ji came to my notice.
He has written that when the British had arrested Birsa Munda on March 30, he was only 25 years old.
Yoga Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshed Ji Tatt.
He added that these two personalities have come from different family backgrounds, which have enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
Birsa Munda and Jamshed ji Tatt in Mann Ki Baat are equally bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great wonders have illuminated the name of not only Jharkhand but the whole country.
The whole country is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youngsters need an inspirational personality for guidance then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
When they were asleep, the British had hid themselves and caught them with a lot of drive.
Do you know why the British resorted to such a vibrant activity
Because the British who had grown such a large empire were also afraid of them.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda had only distracted the British rule decorated with guns and cannons from his traditional thirst.
In fact, when people get an inspirational leadership, people's collective willpower is overwhelmed by the power of handicrafts.
Lord Birsa Munda did not confront the British only for political freedom.
But the tribals also fought for social and economic rights.
In his short life, he has done all this.
In the dark life of the deprived and exploited, he shines like the sun.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at a young age of 25 years.
Bharat Mata like Birsa Munda has been born in all parts of the country.
There should not be any corner of India, where no one has contributed to the freedom struggle for centuries.
But unfortunately, the words of his sacrifice, valour and sacrifice have not reached the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda gave us the pride of his existence, then he gave the country a great institution like Jamshedji Tata.
Jamshed Ji Tata was a vision in true sense, who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation.
He knew very well that it was his vision for the future to make India the centre of science technology and industries.
As a result, the Institute of Science was established which is now called the Indian Institute of Science (Indian Institute of Science).
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarjibhai Desai was born on 2nd February.
You all know that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, the master of comfortable and peaceful personality, was one of the most distinguished leaders of the country.
Moorarjibhai Desai's name is the record of presentation of the highest budget in the Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai undertook a skilled leadership of India in such a difficult time as the country had a threat to democratic tensions.
Morarjibhai Desai jumped into the campaign against bitter defence of democracy.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price in old age too.
The government of that period had arrested him and put him in jail.
But when he won the Janta Party elections in 1, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The amendment also envisages that the fundamental rights obtained under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be defrauded.
For the first time, such arrangements have been made that only after the written recommendations of the Cabinet, the President will announce the criteria and it has also been decided that the criteria of criteria cannot be increased more than six months at a time.
In this way, Moorarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which Katokti Ladi was assassinated in the 15th century cannot be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my tribute to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, this year too, people were very excited about Padma Awards.
Today, we are moving ahead on the path of a New India, we want to respect those people who are doing their job at the level of the foundation.
On the strength of their hard work, those who are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
In fact, he is a true workman, who remains unemployed in public service, social service and in front of all of them.
I want to tell you about some such people.
Talking about Abdul Ghafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he worked as a marvellous revival of the traditional rogan art of Kutch.
He is doing a great job to bring this rare painting to a new generation.
The Tire of Life Culture, built by Abdul Ghafur, was presented to former US President Barack Obama.
Shabbid Said of Marathawad is known as the servant of Gomata in getting Padmapuraskar.
The way he has delivered his entire life to the service of the goddess is indeed unique.
You will be surprised to hear about the Tao Porchan-Lynch of America. Lynch has become a living institution of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he has been training the people around the world and has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers so far.
Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Tarzen in Jharkhand, worked boldly to meet the wealthy and nepotists of Tember, not only saved 50 hectares of forests, but also inspired ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
Despite self-divorce, it is difficult to get the example of the work they have done for the upliftment of the disabled women and by establishing an institution called Pragyachakshya Mahila Sevakunj, they are working to make the eyeless children self-sufficient.
He has presented an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture profitable.
Kisan Chachi has inspired more than 300 women in their area to join the self-sufficient group and to make them economically legislative.
My dear countrymen, I want to talk about the experience that touches everyone's heart for the last few days.
Today, I have been trying to get some of the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana PMJay.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I have seen a great change in the lives of the poor.
If you all know any such poor person who cannot be treated because of lack of money then tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time of examination in schools is initiated.
Different education boards across the country will start functioning for the examination of the 10th and 12th standard board in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the students, their volunteers and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a big event of the Pariksha Pe Charcha was held in Delhi in the form of a townhole.
The specialty of the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme was that there was an open-day interaction on different subjects related to the examination.
Some aspects have come up which can definitely be beneficial for students.
All students can see the entire programme on their parents and teachers on YouTube and greet all my test fighters for the next exam.
My dear countrymen, there is no talk of India and not a festival.
Perhaps there should not be any day in our country which has no importance.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivratri will come and this time the Shivaratri is on Monday and when the Shivaratri is on Monday, it has a special significance in our hearts.
My best wishes to all of you on this sacred festival of Shivaratri.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend time with Divyang brothers and sisters.
He said, I am the Prime Minister's Memory.
I am extremely impressed by the power of the disabled youth.
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through the medium of radio, I meet millions of families in a way every month.
Sometimes, while talking to you all, listening to your letters or listening to the thoughts sent on the phone, I feel like giving me the share of my family.
This is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Electoral Elections are a big source of democracy.
For the next two months, we will be busy in the race for the elections.
And for years, we will continue to talk to you.
Once again, I thank you all with my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. On the 21st of this month, the country received a very sad news.
Shiv Kumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to society.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us: "It is equal to Lord Shiva's residence in Kailash Dham to fulfill his responsibility while working hard.
He was a well-known scholar who had wonderful stance on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He put his entire life behind the aim of providing food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
The farmers had every kind of welfare, they used to be the priority of Swamiji's life.
Siddhaganga monastery was regularly organising cattle and agricultural fairs.
I am fortunate to have received the blessings of the most venerable Swami ji several times.
On this occasion, Kalamsaheb had narrated a poem for revered Swami ji.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shri Shiv Kumar Swami Ji and the Mission of Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I pay my tributes to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
There is no scope for ensuring that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, gets the opportunity to vote.
When we hear that a polling booth is set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15 thousand feet from sea level, a polling booth is also arranged in remote islands in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Only for a voter
When we listen to these things, it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
In view of a voter, the voter gets an opportunity to use his vote, the entire team of Election Commission employees goes to remote areas and arranges for voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission for its continuous efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure free and unsupported elections.
This year, the Lok Sabha will be held in our country, this will be the first time that young people born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
The opportunity has come to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now he is going to become a part of the decision making process in the country.
It is time to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation that if they are eligible to vote, they will recognise themselves as voters.
Everyone of us should realize that becoming a voter in the country, getting the right to vote is one of the important achievements of life.
It is my duty to vote - this feeling should be consistent within us.
If we cannot vote for any reason in life then it should be very painful.
Sometimes it should be sad to see something wrong in the country.
I urge the country's well-known clients to make people aware of whether we have to register voters together or vote on the day of polling.
I am hopeful that a large number of youngsters will register as voters and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great soil of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some unforgettable work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated their lives with a different style.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the brave men who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You know that many rooms and buildings have been closed since Independence inside the Red Fort.
The closed Red Fort rooms have been converted into beautiful museums, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army, the museum, Yad-e-Jalia, and the first freedom struggle of India in 1985-India, and the entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
In each brick of these museums, the aroma of our glorious history is settled.
Anyone in the museum inspires us to go inside the history of our freedom struggle.
At this place, British rule had filed a case against Bharat Mata's brave sons - Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was portraying the memories associated with Netaji in the Kranti Mandir in the Red Fort, the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special hat.
Netaji used to wear this cap.
I kept the cap in the museum so that people visiting there also look at the cap and inspire the patriotism.
In fact, the valour and patriotism of our actresses are required to continuously reach the new generation in different ways.
Just a few months ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In a program, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose launched the Tricolor at the same place 5 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is such a tradition on August 15.
This was the occasion of the completion of 5 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled associator.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with Oajswini sources like Dilli Chalu, Tum Muse Khun, My Tumheen Azadi Dunga.
For many years, we have been demanding that the files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked together with Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places related to the greatsters of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road connected to Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or the Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must visit these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I call you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always believed that Netaji had a close relationship with the radio and he also chose the radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu launched the Azad Hind Radio and through the radio, he interacted with the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and the people of the country.
I was told that it also broadcasts radio stations, weekly news bulletins, which used to live in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Maratha, Punjabi, West and Urdu etc.
Residents of Gujarat in the operation of this radio station.
Vyas ji played a very important role.
The programmes being broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular amongst the common people and their programmes also strengthened our freedom fighters.
A visual art museum has also been built in this Kranti temple .
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture very attractively.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 paintings and artworks of the three centuries old.
Excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avindranath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Seloz Mukherjee have been exhibited in the museum.
And I would especially request you to see the work done by you and the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you must be wondering that there is talk of art and I am talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made pictures on several topics.
He has also made pictures of animals and birds, he has also made pictures of many beautiful scenes and then he has also worked to bring human characters to Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to most of his work.
He believed that those who see their pictures themselves understand the pictures and see the messages delivered by them in the pictures from their perspective.
Their pictures have also been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will definitely visit their pictures in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed their message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such saint was Saint Ravidas.
Ravidas Jayanti is on 1st February.
The story of Saint Ravidas ji is very famous.
Saint Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every person, it is not appropriate to share them on caste, religion and other social bases.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the sacred land of Varanasi.
Through his message, Saint Ravidas ji tried to understand the importance of labour and labour during his entire lifetime.
It will not be wrong to say that they have realized the real meaning of the destiny of labour to the world.
He used to say, "Man Changa and Kathauti, if I mean Ganga, if your heart and heart are sacred then Sakshat God resides in your heart.
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced every level, every class, whether the Maharaja and the ueen of Chittor or the Meerabai, all of them were their followers.
I once again bow down to Saint Ravidas Ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I have highlighted Indias space programme and its aspects related to the future.
He also wanted me to enjoy the students in the space program and to think of going ahead of the sky, and to take some interest in the space programme.
A few days ago, I was Ahmedabad where I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sadbhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud of the fact that satellites and sounding activities developed by our students are reaching space today.
The Kalam-Set launched by our scholars on 24th January.
The Sounding Rockets built by the University students in Odisha have also made several records.
Since the country became independent, the space mission has been started almost the same in the last four years since 2014.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously with one spacecraft.
We are going to recall Indias presence in the Chandrayaan-2 mission in a short span of time.
Our country is using Space Technology in a beautiful way in protecting the lives of people.
Whether it is a challenge or rail and road safety, all of these are getting a lot of support from space technology.
The National Devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their safety and economic progress.
We are using Space Technology to improve the delivery of government services and responsibilities.
About 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been given Geo-Tags in this scheme.
At the same time, about three and a half crore wealth has been tagged under Manrega.
Our satellites are a symbol of the growing strength of the country.
It has a great contribution in our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Settlements has been a unique initiative, which has also provided development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through our border competitive launch services, India launches satellites of not only developing countries but also developing countries.
The sky and the stars are always attractive to the children.
Our space programme provides children with great ideas and opportunities to move beyond the borders which were considered impossible so far.
It is a vision for our children to watch the stars as well as to inspire them to find innovative stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that whoever plays will play and this time many young and young players have emerged in Khelo India.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
When the player performs the best at the local level, he will also perform the best at the global level.
This time, in Khelo India, the players of every state have performed well at their own level.
The lives of many players who won medals are inspiring.
In Muktabaji, young player Akash Gorakha won the silver lunar and I was reading that Ramesh Ji, father of the sky, works as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shade with his family.
Soonali Helvey Satara, the son of Maharashtra's Under 21 Women's Kabbadi team.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali's Hunar.
Many times it is seen that girls are not encouraged in such sports like Kabbadi.
Yet, Sonali chose Kabbadi and performed excellent exhibitions.
ASSOL's ten-year-old Abhinav Shaw is the youngest Golden Moon in the Khelo India Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter Akshata Basawani earned a golden lunar in VETLIFTING.
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is the resolve of the youth power that is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India are showing that not only the people of big cities are contributing to the creation of a New India, but also those coming from small towns, villages, young people, young people and talents.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of a number of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard about the competition to shine the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have also taken part in a unique competition that lasted nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is - clean beautiful toilets.
Besides keeping their toilets clean, they are also making it beautiful by making some paintings in colour and you will also get to see from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Kamrup on several photos of the clean beautiful toilets social media.
I urge all the Sarpanches and the rural Prime Ministers to lead this campaign in my Panchayat.
Definitely showcase your clean toilets on social media with MyIzzatGhar.
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we started a synonymous journey together to free our country from clean and open defecation.
With the help of the people of India today, India has moved towards becoming open defecation free long before 2nd October, 2019 to pay tribute to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The sportspersons of Mann Ki Baat have also played a very important role in this remarkable journey of Swachh Bharat and therefore, it is heartening to note that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 6000 districts have declared themselves free from open defecation and cleaning coverage has crossed 8 and about 9 crore families have been provided with toilet facilities.
My young friends, the days of examinations will come.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about the challenges of examinations and examinations.
Anshula ji, thank you for raising this issue.
Yes, the first part of the year is the period of examination for many families.
From their parents to teachers, many people are busy doing exams.
I extend my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to discuss this matter today, but you will be happy to know that I am going to interact with the students from across the country at the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme on January 21, after two days.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this programme.
All aspects of the exams, especially my young friends, will be associated with stress-free exams in this exam.
I had requested people to send inputs and ideas and I am very happy that a large number of people are keeping their views on MyGov.
I will keep some of these thoughts and suggestions in front of you during the town hall programme.
You must share this program...
You will also be able to see its live broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, on 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
The entire country pays homage to the martyrs at 11.
We must pay tributes to the martyrs for two minutes wherever we are.
Let us move forward with this resolve to recall the revered Bapu and to fulfill the dreams of revered Bapu, to build a New India, to fulfil our commitments as citizens.
This journey of 2019 will be successfully forwarded.
My best wishes to you, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do to bring about a transformation in our lives and contribute to the progress of the country and society.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
You all must have thought of how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to recall how India will remember it as a country, as a strength of a million and thirty crore people.
It is an honor to all of us.
In 2018, the worlds largest health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat, was launched.
Electricity has reached every village in the country.
The world's eminent institutions have acknowledged that India is liberating the country from poverty.
With the adventive resolve of the countrymen, the Swachhta coverage is moving towards crossing 5 percent.
For the first time from the Red Fort after Independence, the Tricolor was hoisted on the 5th anniversary of the Government of India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who served the country in the list of unity, got the highest statue of unity in the world.
The name of the country is high in the world.
The country was honored with the highest environmental award of the Champions of the Earth Award.
India's efforts in solar energy and cleaning chains have been ranked in the world.
The country's self-determination has achieved a new strength.
This year, our country has successfully completed the nuclear triad, so now we have become immensely powerful in water, space and river three.
The daughters of the country have proudly visited the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has resulted in a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The country's longest rail-road bridge Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the nation. The first and the first airport of Sikkim and the sixth airport of the country, Pakiyong, was inaugurated.
India won the World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India won a large number of ચંદ્રaks in Asian Games.
India has also performed well in Para Asian Games.
However, if I keep talking about the mandate of every Indian and our collective efforts, then our minds will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this has been possible by the efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
I hope that this journey of progress and development of India will continue in 2019 and our country will be able to scale new heights more firmly.
My dear countrymen, in this December, we lost some extraordinary countrymen.
Dr. Jayachandran was known for providing cheap treatment to the poor.
People say they were always ready for the treatment of the patient.
He used to pay rent to the elderly patients who came to him for treatment.
I'm thabetterindia.
He has read many such works that inspire society on com websites.
Similarly, on 25th December, the demise of Sulagiti Narasimha in Karnataka was found.
Sulagiti Narsamma was a helper in delivery to pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was honored with Padma Shri.
There are many inspirational personalities like Doctor Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narsamma who dedicated their lives for the sake of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to discuss the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the past, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors from the city take free treatment by putting camps.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these postal friends associated with service with selflessness is truly eligible for appreciation.
Today, I am proud to say that due to collective efforts, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
When we got the opportunity to learn about Jayachandran, we got the opportunity to get the opportunity.
I am trying to know such inspirational things by visiting the comm
I am glad that today there are many websites that are introducing us from many stories that inspire us from the lives of such people.
Like thepositiveIndia.
Com is working to spread positiveness in society and to make society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who bring about a transformation in society.
It is easier to spread negativity but many good works are being done around us in the society and all these are being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Every society has the importance of playing games.
When the games are played, the minds of the auditors are also filled with energy.
We realize the names, identity and dignity of the players.
But sometimes there are many things behind him that are more than sports, which are more than sports.
I want to talk about Hanya Visar, a daughter of Kashmir, who has won golden lunar at Karate Championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hanaya studied Karate with hard work and perspective and showed her a very slight observation.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for a bright future.
Many good wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussion in the media about a 16-year-old girl's wedding.
You must have read it too.
Rajni won the Golden Jubilee Centre at the Junior Women's Mukkabaji competition.
Rajni drank a glass of milk on a stall of milk and a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni put his lunar into a cloth and put it in the bag.
You must be wondering why Rajni drank a glass of milk
He has done this in honor of his father Jasmer Singh Ji, who sells luxury on a stall of Panipat.
Rajani said that her father has made a lot of sacrifice in bringing her back here.
Jessemer Singh used to go to work even before he got up in the morning and his brothers and sisters.
When Rajani expressed her desire to learn boxing before her father, her father encouraged her to achieve all possible resources for her.
Rajini had to start a scheduled study with old moods because at that time his family's economic situation was not good.
Despite all these methods, the royal interests were not lost and the royalty was taught.
He also won a lunar in Serbia.
I extend my best wishes and blessings to Rajini.
And I congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting her and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian tourist cycle in the world.
He used to run around 300 km of cycles every day for 15 days.
Do we not get inspiration by knowing about this kind of achievement
Especially my young friends, when we listen to such incidents, we also inspire ourselves to show something in the midst of difficulties.
If it is capable of imagining, enthusiasm is full then the obstacles are destroyed automatically.
Difficulties can never be interrupted.
If we listen to many such examples then we also get a new inspiration every moment in our lives.
My dear countrymen, many festivals with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in January are like Lohadi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magha Bihu, Maghi
During this time, the Sun descends and enters Makar rashi.
After this day the day starts growing gradually and cold crops start getting cut.
My best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
Unity in diversity is one India - the spirit of excellent India. Our festivals are concentrated in itself.
We can see how close our festivals and festivals are connected with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered different, and there is only one person and society here.
There is a good example of our engagement with nature, the Calendar based on festivals.
There is also a list of planetaries along with festivals.
This traditional calendar shows how old is our relationship with natural and astronomical incidents.
The date of festivals and festivals is determined according to the moon and suncaller based on the speed of the moon and the sun.
It depends on which calendar is considered.
Festivals are also celebrated in many areas as per the conditions of the planets.
All these festivals are celebrated in accordance with the Sun Calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishak, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakhi, Bihu.
In many of our festivals, the feelings of saving rivers and water are particularly inherent.
Six Festivals - Rivers and Lakes are connected with sunrise.
Even on Makar Sankranti, millions of people drown in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals also give us understanding of social values.
On the one hand, it has an ancient importance and on the other hand every festival is taught very easily to live with each other.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the 2019 and wish you all the best for the coming festivals.
Share the issues taken on these festivals with everyone so that Indias diversity and beauty of Indian culture can be seen.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of respect in our culture that we can proudly and showcase the entire world with pride and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Even in films, we must have seen a lot about its magnificence and enormity and it will be true, the form of Kumbh is as magnificent as the divine.
People from all over the country come and join Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, the people of faith and devotion are celebrated.
Millions of people from the country and abroad join together.
The tradition of Kumbh has been reflected and reflected in our great cultural heritage.
This time, the World famous Kumbh Mela to be held in Prayagraj on 15th January, which is perhaps awaiting you all with great enthusiasm.
For the Kumbh festival, the silos have been started to reach the saints and the monks.
Its global importance can also be estimated from the fact that last year UNESCO has identified the Kumbh Mela in the Integrated Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the princes of several countries witnessed the preparations for the Kumbh, where the national flags of many countries were flagged off.
More than 150 people of the country are likely to come to the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.
With the divineness of Kumbh, Indias magnificence will spread its color throughout the world.
This can be a very big learning experience especially for youngsters.
I myself had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago. I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are going on from Jorshore.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh.
There I dedicated the Integrated Commonwealth Centre and the devotees will get a lot of support.
This time a lot of emphasis is being laid on cleanliness in Kumbh.
If there is cleanliness along with faith in the organisation then its message will reach far and wide.
This time every devotee will also be able to perform Akshayvad after the sacred bath in the Sangam.
This Akshayvad, a symbol of peoples faith, was closed in the fort for hundreds of years whose devotees could not see.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for everyone.
My brothers and sisters, whenever you come to the Kumbh, you must put yourselves on different aspects of Kumbh and the social media so that more and more people get inspiration to go to Kumbh.
The Kumbh of spirituality becomes the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh of faith is also a Kumbh of nationality.
This Kumbh of the devotees also becomes the Mahakumbh of the global tourists.
This Kumbh of artisticity is also a great Kumbh of creative powers.
Pujay Bapu and South Africa have had an unbreakable relationship.
He was South Africa from where Mohan became Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood firmly against the discrimination.
He also established Finics and Tolstoy Pharmaceuticals, from which he resonated for peace and justice all over the world.
2018- Nelson Mandela's birth is also celebrated as a centenary year, which is also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of a conflict against diversity all over the world and who was the inspiration of Mandela
He had the power to live in the prison for so many years and inspiration from Pujay Bapu.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspirational for the entire world, but their ideals also encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the world's highest statue is the Statue of Unity, there was a positive discussion with the police personnel of the country.
What kind of steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen are discussed in detail.
In the meanwhile, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for national unity. This award will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He has always been trying to keep India's integrity untouched.
Sardar Saheb believed that India's strength is in diversity here.
I salute Sardar Patel Jis passion through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, on 13th January, Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary is sacred.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For a long time, his workplace was North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi in Patna, Karmabhoomi in North India and the last minute of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India received his blessings.
If we look at his lifetime, it shows a glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji had gained the position of Guru in a young age.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus in Varanasi.
He had a quiet and simple personality, but when an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak people, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and therefore he says that one hundred and a half million young friends, Chidio Son-man-Baj Tudunteb.
He said strength cannot be shown by fighting with the weaker sections.
Shri Govind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to overcome human sufferings.
He was a divine man full of bravery, valour, sacrifice, religious purity, who had an unbiased knowledge of both science and science.
He was not only a trident but also a scholar of several languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again bow down to Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
That is, it is happening by Food Safety and Standard Authority of India.
Several programmes are being organized across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this series, F.
Under the Eat Right India Abhiyan, healthy India tours are coming out across the country.
The campaign will run till 2nd January.
When India is clean and healthy, India will also be prosperous.
The most important for good health is nutritious food.
You will also participate in it and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
The important education of food is from childhood itself.
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, talk of mind, life of the person, life of the nation, life of the society, inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, let us move ahead and change ourselves, change our country too.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October 2014, the auspicious festival of Vijaya Dashmi, we all started a simultaneous journey through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, 50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat have been completed.
Similarly, today it is Golden Jubilee Episod - Golden Jubilee Episod.
The letters and phones that you have received this time are mostly related to this 50th episode.
Similarly, Manika Jain, Bardwan, Presenjit Sarkar of West Bengal and Sangeeta Scientist from Nagpur, on the Narendra Modi App have asked about one kind of questions.
He says that many times people connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile apps, but why did you like radio to connect with people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today's era when almost the radio had gone wrong, why did Modi come with the radio
I was nine months old and I was going to some other place traveling in the evening.
In the mountains of Himachal, when they get cold in the evening, they stayed for tea on a dhaba on the way and when I ordered for tea, they were a small dhaba, a single person used to make and sell tea themselves.
There was no clothing on top.
Similarly, he was standing with a small lari on the bank of the road.
He said, No, you don't know what, it is a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand anything, he said, "See Saheb Radio, there was talk of it on the radio.
No one can compare the reach and depth of the communication.
This thing has been done in my mind since then and I had realized the strength of this thing.
So when I became a big Prime Minister, my attention towards the most powerful medium was very natural.
And when I assumed office as a Prime Minister in May 2014, I wanted that the unity of the country, its magnificent history, its valour, the diversity of India, the serenity of our society, the supremacy of the people, the supremacy of the people, the supremacy, the sacrifice and penance of all these things should be brought to the people of India.
From far-flung villages to cities, farmers to young businessmen...
Recently, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these aspects which are very interesting.
Out of those who have been surveyed, approximately 0 percent are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is that it has enhanced the spirit of positiveness in society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, mass movements have been encouraged in a big way.
There has been a comprehensive discussion on India-Position.
It is also a glimpse of the spirit of positiveness and positiveness in the minds of our countrymen.
People have also expressed their feelings that Mann Ki Baat has increased the feeling of doing something with volunteering i. e.
With the radio, mobile, internet, Facebook लाइव and Pariscope, Narendra Modi is also connecting Mann Ki Baat through App.
I am extremely grateful to all the members of the Mann Ki Baat family for expressing their faith in it and becoming part of it.
Your chance is true.
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and listens to the number of millions and millions then what should be needed
Some young friends made a study on all the topics in Mann Ki Baat, they analyzed the words of all the episodes and studied how many words were spoken.
Which words were spoken again and again.
One of their points is that this programme has been unpopular.
When Mann Ki Baat was started, I had decided that there should not be any political support or admiration of the government, there should be no Modi or any of you, and the biggest strength and the biggest inspiration to reflect my commitment.
Modi will come and go but this country will remain intact, our culture will remain intact.
130 crore countrymen will always live these small things.
This country will take new inspiration and enthusiasm to new heights.
Any government will have the power to start with a small village in Haryana, not only in the entire country but also abroad.
Every section of the society, the celebrity, all are connected and in a new, modern language of thought change in society, which today's generation understands.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat is also joking, but in my mind, 130 crore countrymen are always living.
Their heart is my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government matter - it is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
India's original life is not political, it is not India's original life-style.
The original life of India is society and society.
There are thousands of aspects of society and one aspect of it is Rajkaran.
This is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes incidents of politics and politicians get so defeated that other talents and other men of the society are suppressed.
This is the collective responsibility of all of us and Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort to ensure that the talents of the common man get proper place for the bright future of a country like India.
Your question is a question of self-reliance in a way.
I believe that the greatest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking a big Prime Minister but asking questions to a close friend of yours.
If I reply directly to the questions you have asked, you will say, nothing.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Every time people's letters come before Mann Ki Baat.
People tell their views on May Goa and Narendra Modi Mobile App. There is also a toll free number of 18001180.
People also record their messages by calling them there.
When the episode of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, I read the thoughts and information sent by you during the tour.
And that is why when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with myself.
Later, I would like to note some facts like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
In fact, my voice is in Mann Ki Baat, but for examples, feelings and feelings are of my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not yet been named in Mann Ki Baat, but they keep sending their letters and their comments without disappearance - your thoughts and your feelings are very important in my life.
I am confident that you all will be able to get many times more than before and make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
It has also been tried that the letters which are not included in Mann Ki Baat also pay attention to the letters and suggestions.
With his hard work, Mann Ki Baat reaches more and more people.
The team of Akashwani prepares each episode for broadcasting in many languages.
Some people efficiently listen to the voice of Modi in regional languages and Mann Ki Baat in the same town.
Similarly, he becomes Narendra Modi for just 30 minutes.
I also congratulate those people for their talent and skills.
I would like to urge you all to listen to this program in your local languages.
I also congratulate my friends of the media who are regularly broadcasting Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
Any political media is never happy, it feels that it gets very little coverage or the coverage that is available is negative, but the media has made several issues raised in Mann Ki Baat.
There are several topics like Swachhta, Road Safety, Drugs Free India, Self-with Doctors, which the media has worked as a new mission.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
In fact, I have no secret.
What I am doing will continue to happen in all the families.
In a simple language, I try to put myself in the youth and put myself in that situation and put myself in a harmony with his thoughts and try to make a welfare match.
This is the old bag of our lives when it does not come in between, it becomes easier to understand anyone.
Todays youths are very much that they do not do anything that they do not believe in themselves and when they believe in any thing then they leave everything behind them.
Many times people discuss the Communication Gap between older people and youngsters in the family.
In fact, interaction with youngsters in most families is very limited.
In most of the times, the words of reading or the habits of lifestyle or the words of such a tax are not being stopped, the words of an unexpected mind have gradually started decreasing in the families and it is also a matter of concern.
Instead of expediting and dismissing, dialogue will be effective.
My efforts are to continuously interact with the youth through various programmes or social media.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or thinking.
They always have a store of ideas.
They are extremely powerful, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I urge the youth to share their efforts and their words as much as possible.
Many times there is a complaint that the youth asks a lot of questions.
I say that it is better that youngsters question.
This is a good thing because it means that they ask to check everything from the roots.
Some people say that there is no patience in the youth but I believe that the youth do not have time to widen. This is the same thing that helps the youth to become more innovative because they ask for things faster.
We feel that today's youngsters are very ambitious and think of many big things.
It is good to see big dreams and achieve big achievements.
Finally, this is the New India.
Some people say that the young generation asks for many things at the same time.
I say what is wrong in it
He is synonymous with multi-skilling, so he does this.
If we look around then whether it is social interpretation or start-up, sports or any other sector, it is young people who bring about a big change in society.
Those youngsters who have shown the courage to ask questions and to see big dreams.
If we throw the ideas of the youth on the ground and give them an open environment to express them, they can bring about positive changes in the country, they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vineeta Ji has written on May Goa that in Mann Ki Baat, I should talk about the Constitution Day coming on November 26.
He said that this day is special because we enter the 0th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vineeta Ji, thank you very much for your suggestion.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
The day of reminiscence of the great achievements that made our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 2014.
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 11 days to complete this historic task of building construction.
Just imagine that within three years, these great wonders gave us such a comprehensive and extensive solution.
The extraordinary speed in which he constructed the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
It also inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in the record time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country, each of them was committed to giving a Constitution to their country so that the people of India could be empowered and the poorest of the poor could also be supported.
The special feature of our constitution is that the rights and duties are detailed in detail.
In the lives of the citizens, both of them will take the country forward.
If we respect other rights, our rights will be protected automatically and if we follow our duties in the Constitution, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember that in the year 2019, when 60 years of India's Republic was completed, we had taken a blessings of the Constitution by putting an elephant on Gujarat.
It was a memorable occasion to enhance awareness among the youth about the constitution and connect them with the framework.
We will complete 0 years as a democracy in 2020 and 5 years of our independence will be completed in 2022.
Come let us all move forward the values of our Constitution and ensure Peace, Progress, Property, peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of the great man can never be forgotten which was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
His Excellency on 6th December is the Republic Day.
I salute Baba Saheb on behalf of all the people of the country who have given the right to live with respect to crores of Indians.
The democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say that the democratic values of India have not come from outside.
What is the democracy and what is the parliamentary system - it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he made a very passionate appeal that we have to protect our freedom after such a conflict.
He also used to say that even if we are from different backgrounds of Indians, we have to keep the country on all things.
My dear countrymen, on November 23, two days ago, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and in the coming year, we are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, compassion, service, compassion and harmony.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of the sacred places associated with Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Recently, when I was doing a meeting with him, I remembered the writer Sahib Gurudwara at that time.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara had suffered a lot but the way the state government had renovated it with the local people is still an example.
The Government of India has made an important decision to make the Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit the sacred place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan, Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, we will meet once again after 50 episodes, in the next Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today, I got the opportunity to keep this programme behind you for the first time because you asked such questions but our journey will continue.
As much as your partner will add, our journey will become deeper and will make everyone satisfying.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I would like to say that one thing touches my mind in the images of Mann Ki Baat. Most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat while sitting with all the family, it seems that the elders of our family are sharing their own things amongst us.
I am very satisfying that I am yours, I am one of you and in a way I will continue to come again and again through Mann Ki Baat as your family members.
Your aspirations, my ambitions.
Let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
About six and a half months before Independence, the edition of the world's famous International Magazine Time Magazine published on 2nd January, 2014 was the explanation of Sardar Patel.
In his main stories, he had published a map of India and it was not a map we see today.
It was a map of India divided into several parts.
Time Magazine had written that there were threats like division, violence, food crisis, inflation and power politics on India.
Time Magazine further writes that among all this, if anyone has the ability to serve the country in the list of unity and to fill the people then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
How he gave direction to Bardoli Satyagraha.
Their responsibilities and responsibilities for the country were such that from the farmers to the entrepreneurs, everyone used to trust them.
Whether it is Junagarh or Hyderabad, Travancore or Rajwada in Rajasthan, it was the Sardar Patel which we can see a Hindustan today with the sustainable and strategic skills.
We naturally recall Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by looking at our mother India, this nation, which is bound by unity.
We will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying a true tribute to Sardar Patel on this day.
The height of this statue situated on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is doubled by the American Statue of Liberty.
It is the world's highest Ganganchumbi idol.
Every Indian will now be proud of the fact that the world's highest statue is on the soil of India.
The Sardar Patel, which was associated with the land, will now enhance the sight of the sky.
I salute the families of our soldiers for their courage, but do you know why we celebrate this infantry day to the citizens of India
This is the day when the Indian soldiers had landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the valley from the masks.
This historic event also has a direct connection with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with Sama Manekshaw, who was the great army officer of India.
He was reminiscent of the time when he was a corneral.
During this period, a military campaign was launched in Kashmir in October 14.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said that during a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had been deprived of delays in sending troops to Kashmir. During his meeting, Sardar Patel looked at him in his special style and said that there should not be any delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and as soon as possible it can be resolved.
After that the soldiers flew in the Kashmir-based flight and we saw how the army succeeded.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi ji is also a pilgrimage.
I congratulate Indira Ji too.
My dear countrymen, no one likes sports.
Recently, I had two memorable visits.
Earlier, we had the opportunity to meet our Para Athletes at Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
In these sports, India has made a total of 2 silver winners a new sequence and has enhanced India's pride.
I am fortunate to meet Para Athletes and congratulate them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youngsters have performed the best in Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we also achieved 3 other monuments in the micro-events besides 13 monuments.
You will remember that this time India's performance in Asian Games has also been very good.
See, in the last few minutes, how many times I used the best words so far, the most glorious words.
This is the story of todays Indian sports which is touching new heights on the day.
India is not only making new records in sports but also in those areas which were never thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won the Gold Medal for the country in Asian Para Games in 2018.
He is a Divyang from birth.
When he was eight, he lost his father.
He later spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, we worked as a waiter at Dhaba on the roadside roads in Delhi to clean the DTC buses.
Today, the same Narayan International events have been winning the golden lunar for India.
Moreover, look at the growing generosity of excellence in Indias sports, India has never won in Judo, whether it is a senior level or a junior level or an all-time medal.
But Tababi Devi won the history by winning the silver in Judo in Youth Olympics.
16-year-old young player Tababi Devi is a resident of a village in Manipur.
Their father is a laborer while the mother works to sell fish.
There was a time when they did not even have food money.
In such a situation, Tababi Devi's courage is not desperate.
He created history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is inspiring.
Every young sportsperson is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that we successfully organised the FIFA UNDER-1 World Cup in 2019.
The whole world also appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
There was also a new record about the number of visitors in the Fifa Under-1 World Cup.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and increased the courage of young players.
This year, India has got the privilege of organizing the Men Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian wants to play any sports sports or interest in any sportsperson, he has a feeling towards hockey.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has won gold medals in many competitions and has once won the World Cup.
India has also given many great players to Hockey.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is well-known throughout the world.
After that, Hawky has cut a big maze from Balvinder Singh Cineer, Lesli Cloudys, Mohammed Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, Team Indias players are inspiring the new generation of Hockey with the success achieved due to their hard work and perseverance.
There is a good opportunity to see adventurous games for sports lovers.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only encourage the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Male Hockey Team for this competition and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing in their support and I congratulate all the teams of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming self-sufficient and inspiring for the countrymen.
But in a new era, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way, in a new way in a new way, in a new way, in a new way in a new way in a new way and a new way in a new way in a new way.
Every Indian will be proud of the enthusiasm and affection he has for this work.
It has the aroma of visiting IT to society, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't.
Somebody is singing to children and somebody is singing to old people.
Somebody is associated with cleanliness, somebody is helping the farmers and there is no reluctance to do all that but there is an unsavorable feeling of dedication and determination.
A young man himself learned Wheelchair Basketball for the help of Wheelchair Basketball team of disabled.
This is the dedication that is the dedication that is going on with this mission.
Will any Indian be proud of this
This spirit of Mann Ki Ham will inspire us all.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was watching your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I saw a very interesting drop of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov: Please speak in Mann Ki Baat how the practices and traditions of the Indian tribes are an excellent example of cooperation with nature.
How we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for sustainable development, some of them need to learn.
I congratulate you for keeping this topic among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a matter that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture. Today, the entire world is particularly discussing environmental protection and looking for new ways for balanced lifestyle.
However, our India is not free from this problem even years, but for its movement, we just have to pay attention to our rich history and traditions, especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Staying in harmony with nature has been involved in the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like Goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe of Central India, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship trees like peepal and Arjun.
In the desert of Rajasthan, the Bishnoi society has shown us the path of environmental protection.
Especially in the context of the conservation of trees, it is acceptable to sacrifice their lives but it is not for them to harm a single tree.
The Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with the tigers.
He considers him his brother-in-law Sudha.
In Nagaland also tigers are seen as forest guards .
In Maharashtra, the people of the Barali community consider tiger as guests and the presence of tigers is a prosperity for them.
There is a belief in the Coal community in Central India that their fate is connected with the tigers and if the tigers do not get food then the village will also have to be hungry.
The Gonda tribe of Central India stops fishing in some parts of the Kaithan river during the season of conversion.
They consider these areas as fish shelters, due to this practice they get healthy and abundant fish.
The tribal community makes their homes with natural material and is also strong and environmentally friendly.
In the lonely areas of the Nilgiri Plateau of South India, a small strange community-Toda is traditionally built up with locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living with a very peaceful and mutual fair, but when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that the tribal community was the first among our freedom fighters.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who made a strong struggle against British rule to protect his wild land.
Whatever I have said, the list is very long and there are many examples of tribal community that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and for the wealth that we have saved from the forests today, the country is a tribute to our tribals.
Let us express our respect for them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who are doing some extraordinary work for the society.
Such works which seem to be simple in the first sight, but in reality they have a great impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of society.
Just a few days ago, I was reading about Punjab farmer brother Gurubachan Singh ji.
A common and hardworking farmer was the marriage of Gurubachan Singh ji's daughter.
Before this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will marry simplicity.
Whether it is life or other things or not, there is no need to spend any money.
You will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a straightforward farmer, what he said to his wife is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told him that you should give me a pledge that you don't burn anymore.
You can imagine how big social power is there in it.
Gurubachan Singh ji seems to be very valuable but he shows how huge his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform the personal relevance into the context of society.
The family of Shriman Gurubachan Singh has made such an example before us.
I have read about Kallar Majra, another village in Punjab, which is near Nabha.
Brother Gurubachan Singh ji congratulated him.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and those places which make their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You all are moving the Indian heritage of a healthy lifestyle as a true successor.
Just like TPTP lakes, small awareness and activeness and positive activity play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, in our texts, it is said: "Hey God, all around the world, reside in peace, in water, in the earth, in the sky, in space, in the wind, in the wind, in medicinal herbs, in the vegetation, in consciousness, in the entire universe.
Establish peace everywhere in the heart, in my heart, in the stars, in the particles of the world.
This year, India has a special significance because the First World War ended 100 years ago on 11th November, which ends 100 years, i. e.
The First World War for India was an important event.
In fact, we did not have any idea directly with that war.
Yet, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very important role, gave the highest sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when war comes, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their valour in remote areas and in terrible circumstances.
The only objective behind all of them was the reconstruction of peace.
In the First World War, the world witnessed destruction.
According to estimates, about 1 crore soldiers and almost so many civilians lost their lives.
This understands what is the importance of peace throughout the world.
In the last 100 years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony does not mean just a war.
From terrorism to transformation, economic development to social justice, all of them need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our pride is something else.
The natural beauty of the North-East is unparalleled and the people there are extremely talented.
Our hope is now known for all its best practices.
Ishaan Bharat is an area that has made a big progress in organic farming too.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food processing.
You will be happy to know that this award given for better policy determination in this sector is like an oskar in that area.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for leaving behind 51 definite policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is about to end.
Greetings to all the countrymen for all these festivals.
I would urge you to keep yourself in these festivals, keep in mind your health and also keep in mind the interests of the society.
This festival will also become an opportunity for you to move forward as a mission.
Your progress is a key part of the progress of the country.
The progress you will achieve will be the progress of the country.
My best wishes to you all.
