Mann Ki Baat on October, 2019
My dear countrymen, greetings to you.
Today is the day of Diwali.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The unique feature of the festival is that not only the Indian society, but also the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organizations there celebrate Diwali with joy and joy.
There is a micro world in India.
Friends, Tourism related to the festival of the world has its own attraction for Festival Tourism.
In our country, every region has its own varieties of festivals and people from other countries are particularly interested in this.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in promoting festive tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, we decided to do something different for this Diwali.
I said, Come together, let us celebrate Diwali this time, the women's strength and achievements of India, that is, let us respect Lakshmi of India.
Look, there's a lot of inspiring stories on social media.
My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took responsibility for five children.
Today we have five brothers in good work.
Ramesh ji, my best wishes to your mother.
Geetika Swamy, who is a team on Twitter, says she is the daughter of the bus conductor, Major Kusbu Kanwar Bharatlaxmi, who is headed by Asam Rifles.
His daughter Bharatlaxmi and her own strength for poet Tewari.
She is proud of her daughter being a good filmmaker.
The girl got a good rank in the CAT exam.
While Medha Jain writes, a 92-year-old old man who has been providing free drinking water to the Gwalior railway station for years.
Meghazi, the glory and compassion of Bharatlaxmi is very inspiring.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
You must read, inspire and share things around you...
The idea of that poem gives us a sense that the words of it were written in the seventeenth century.
The greatest words, the greatest emotionality, the greatest thought is in this poem in Kannada language.
The prince of Pindida Parmegond was Jasulidanu, the prince of Pindida, the prince of Pindida, because of his daughter Parvati, Bhrigumuni became famous because of his daughter Lakshmi, the king became famous for his daughter-in-law.
Our daughters are proud of us.
Because of the glory of these women, our society has a strong personality and a bright future.
Dear Countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated throughout the world.
I've never forgotten that I went to the gurus of Vanquin and Tehran.
I understand many things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev, who can share with you, but it will require several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stands firm against many evils like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji delivered his message far away from the world.
He was the most traveller at that time.
Going to many places, everybody's hearts turned away with his luxury and humility, and the behavior of the common man.
It is said that the great religious journeys made by Guru Nanak Dev ji are liberal.
With the message of harmony and equality, he went to the north, south, east, west and looked straight everywhere to the people, saints and sages.
The well-known Saint Shankar Dev of Assam is also believed to be inspiring from him.
Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism went to the pilgrimage sites.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India.
Guru Nanak Dev ji visited Bidar in Karnataka to solve the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Beedar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji.
During a similar journey, Guru Nanak ji travelled in Kashmir and the environment in North India.
This led to a strong link between the Sikh followers and the Kashmiris.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet and the people there considered him a Guru.
He is also worshipped in Uzbekistan.
He has visited the Islamic States, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took a dig at the hearts of millions and follows his advice with great pride, even today.
A few days ago, diplomatic representatives from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
They visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar where Guru Nanak Devji's 550th birthday.
There, these diplomatic delegates also got the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple and know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After that, several ambassadors shared the pictures in the social media and wrote them with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember 31st October.
And that is when the country is in the midst of unity, the melting man of India is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel was surprising to mobilize the people, and fought with ethically interpreted people.
Sardar Patel had seen and learned every small thing more and more.
He was a personality of imagination in a true sense.
At the same time, the organization was also excellent.
He gained talent in building projects and strengthening the war footings.
When reading and listening about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, he knows how deep his preparation was.
Thousands of people from across the country came to attend the Congress General Assembly in Ahmedabad in 1921.
Patel had the responsibility to make all the arrangements related to the Mahasam Parv.
He also called for improving the water supply system in the city.
Nobody has made it difficult for water.
He was associated with the farmers and asked to make Khadi bags.
The farmers made the bag and sold it to the delegates.
Because the shoes are kept in these bags, the delegates don't need to fear the shoes being stolen.
On the other hand, there was a lot of increase in Khadi sales.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitutional Building Church.
He made a great contribution to ensuring sustainable legacy and thereby creating a variety of differences in the caste-Motherland.
Friends, We know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel made a decent effort to unite the nations and made a decreasing effort to reduce history.
It was Sardar Vallabhbhai's privilege to look at everyone.
As soon as the partition of India took place in 1947, our neighbour's eyes fell on the Lakshadweep and they shipped it with the flag of that country.
When Sardar Patel took care of this, he started a draconian step without delay.
He invited brothers like Arcot Ramswamy, Arcot Laxmanaswamy etc. from Thiruvananthapuram to reach Lakshadweep and to raise the Thiruvananthapuram flag on the Lakshadweep.
Without a delay, the tricolor was blown up and the floor was exhibited to see the neighbour's dream of capturing the Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel and other brothers have been advised to ensure that all the assistance required for the development of Lakshadweep is available.
Today, Lakshadweep plays an important role in the development of India.
This is a very attractive tourist place .
I hope you will visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
Dear Countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, I dedicated to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Patel.
It's the tallest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty in America is double.
Every Indian is proud of the world's highest statue.
The heads of all Indians grow proudly.
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists coming to the Statue of Unity within a year.
I am confident that the people there have now started the farming of dragon fruit, which will change the main source of livelihood of the people there.
Friends, This Statue of Unit can be a study for the country, for all the states and for the tourism industry.
We testify how a place develops as a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There people from all over the country and abroad come.
Several projects are developing automatically after one another, including travel facilities, dwellings, guides and environment friendly arrangements.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, Last day, Time Magazine will be an Indian who is not proud of giving a great place to the Statue of Unity in the 100 important tourist destinations of the world.
I hope you're going to visit the Statue of Unity for a while from your valuable time.
However, every Indian who finds time for the journey has to go to at least 15 tourist destinations and my request to stay in the night wherever he goes.
Friends, As you know, we celebrate the National Integration Day every year from 2014 to 31st October.
Today, we convey our message to save the unity, aspirations and security of our country.
Run For Unit will be organized every time on 31st October.
This will include people from all sections of the society, from all walks of life.
Run for Unity, which means that this country is one, goes to the same direction and wants to achieve the same goal.
Similarly, there is a special interest and zeal amongst the people today.
Run Phone Unit is also a beautiful opportunity.
Running is beneficial for mind and mind and body.
Therefore, not only the body, but also the unity of the mind and the culture of India, and to bring India to new heights.
So, if you live in any city, you can find out where the run-for unit is going.
I hope that the unity of India and your own fitness will surely run on 31st October.
Dear Countrymen, Sardar Patel has laid the foundation of unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and awake to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
We can see many examples of constantly striving to enhance mutual harmony.
But many times the problems of society, its contributions and the rapid destruction of memory.
How many people of different kinds went to the plain.
Any kind of excellent clients were playing games to gain from the environment in their own way.
What kind of language is spoken to warm the atmosphere
Efforts have been made to brighten in different voices.
We recall what some phrases and some phrases have said to be self-reliant.
Honouring the court's glory, it is not allowed to create an atmosphere that warms and stresses the society.
These things should always be remembered, which gives us a lot of strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of bitterness.
This is an example of how powerful the voice of unity gives to the nation.
It was a major blow to the country.
I pay my respects to that glory today.
My dear countrymen, today, if you hear a story from a far-flung corner of the household, you can hear a story from every village, from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from every corner of India, then it is about cleanliness.
125 crore Indians are trying to ensure that every person, every family and every village have their own comfortable experience of cleanliness.
Its rights are 125 crore Indians.
But it's a comfortable and charming experience.
I've heard you more.
The world's highest battlefield, at least 50-60 degrees minus.
The air has only oxygen.
In such a hostile environment, it is a great adventure to live between these challenges.
In such a very opposite environment, our brave people not only look at our borders, but also perform a program called Swachh Siachen.
This Siachen is the source of rivers and architecture.
Therefore, the Swachhta Abhiyan here means to ensure clean water for those living in the valleys and they use water in rivers like Newbra, Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, festival is an opportunity to awaken our livelihood.
If Deepawali, especially buy something new, bring something from the market, it is happening at least in the family.
I once told you to try to buy local goods.
If we get things we need in our village then we don't have to go to Taluk.
If you get to the pool, you don't have to go to the district.
As much as we try to buy local goods, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity for himself.
We have to buy something that our dwarfs shaped with the hands of our friends.
I invite you to buy local goods with the good wishes of Deepawali.
Look, how important we can play in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes because of carelessness, fire starts.
There can be boils.
Regulatory yourself, I appeal to all of you to celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Many good wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
No Indian will be proud of our armed forces and the soldiers of our army.
Every Indian, whether in any region or in any caste or community, is always encouraging to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, hundred and twenty-five crore people of India celebrated the day of our army's transition.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers replied to those who were proud of the war on the other side of terrorism across our country.
Our military exhibitions have been organized in different parts of the country with the view to know the strength of more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation.
How we are capable and how our soldiers have enriched their lives and saved the people.
The day like Parakram Parv reminds the youth of the proud tradition of our armed forces.
It inspires us to ensure unity and aspirations of the country.
I also attended a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
Our army is sure to respond to those who try to create an atmosphere of peace in our country.
India is always committed and dedicated to peace.
Our more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed great sacrifices for peace in the two world wars in the 20th century.
And remember that we had nothing to do with that war.
It was in the magnificence of our soldiers for peace.
Today, India is one of the most transmitted nations of the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmets for decades.
My dear countrymen, the sky is different.
On 8th October, we celebrate the Air Force Day.
I congratulate all the clients and their families who have served for the country from the depths of the heart.
When Pakistani invaders launched a sudden attack in 1947, the air force ensured that Indian troops and instruments of war came to the battlefield at the earliest to save Srinagar from the attackers.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
In 1971, Bangladesh was unaware of the freedom struggle.
The role of the Air Force is sustainable in relieving Kargil from the grip of the casualties in 1999.
In Tiger Hill, the air force bombed the enemy's camps and soiled them.
I am grateful to the Air Force for their dedicated efforts to protect our Air Force from accidents.
India can be proud of the fact that in the army of India, not only the strength of men but also the strength of women.
How can Tommy be saved from the country
You know Ablash Tommy is a very adventurous hero.
He is the first Indian to be worldwide with a small boat without the help of a modern technology alone.
For the last 80 days, he continued his journey to the sea to participate in the Golden Global Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the horrific climate made him a threat.
But this Veeran of the Indian Navy has been fighting for crisis in the sea for several days.
He's in the midst of the sea without eating and drinking anything.
I'm not ready to give up my life.
I spoke on the telephone when I saved Abhilash from the sea, a wonderful creation of courage, determination and sympathy.
His courage, courage, determination, determination and victory will be inspired by the youth of our country.
Dear countrymen, everybody knows what is the significance of 2nd October for our nation.
There is a greater significance on 2nd October this year.
For two years from now on, we are going to organise various programmes across the globe by celebrating the centenary ninth birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have inspired the whole world.
Later, when the freedom struggle was strengthened in 1945, he revised the ideas and created a new edition.
His thoughts are inspired by the people about the rights and rights of the renowned Bapu farmers and the village and the workers, including the development of cleanliness, education and development.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Popular Bapu was a people's organiser.
It was his characteristic of meeting and gathering with the people.
This is an experience for everyone as the most important characteristic of his personality.
He convinced every person that the person is the most important and daily needed person in the country.
His most important contribution to the freedom struggle is that he made it a huge democracy.
The people of all sections of the society have dedicated themselves to the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle.
Gandhiji says, I am giving you a mantra.
You'll feel that you're not supposed to be supposed to be.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, one thing should be taken on the basis of the growing middle class and growing economic strength and increasing credibility in the country.
Can we remember the renowned Bapu for a moment when we're going to buy something
Can you remember that mantra of the priest father
Can you imagine which citizen of the country will be benefitted by my purchase
Whose face will be happy
Who will be obvious or indirect because you buy it
I am glad if the poorest of the poor gets the benefit.
This is Gandhijis mantra, this is Gandhijis message and I am confident that a small step in the life of the poorest and weakest person will make a big difference.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that if he cleans the premises then he would not even know how it would be.
But it happened, India got freedom.
Similarly, with a small commitment, how can we make a greater contribution to the economic growth of my country, in economic empowerment, in strengthening the poor against poverty
But if I believe it would be the real patriotism of today's era.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri had to keep Khadi's old and dressed dress as somebody had lost his voice.
He said that these khadi clothings have been made very modern and each of them has to be used.
This feeling, filled with the tea of the country and the love of the people of the country, was filled with a small, lengthy magnificent element.
Within two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientists along with Puja.
As soon as the name of Scientists comes, Indians will be glorified in our hearts.
His soft personality is always proud of the people.
Besides, he was very glorious, but his characteristic is Lal Bahadur Shastri ji, a strong personality like a hill.
His Jawan Jawan Jai Kisan's madness shows his brave personality.
As a reflection of his selflessness to the nation, he gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to reach the summit of victory over nearly one and a half years of narrow rule.
People from all over the country are associated with the fifteenth anniversary.
If you didn't call on the topic after you had made a lot of facilities after the toilets, people who were involved in cleanliness wouldn't have noticed such a heart touching thing.
I would like to thank you for the phone.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded on 2nd October, 2018 at the inauguration of Bapus 100th birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit: 'Because it is Swaraj Syatt.'
In the Constitution given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by his view, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 1993.
More than a few days, the commission is completing its 25 years.
The Human Rights Commission not only defended human rights, but also encouraged dignified self-respect.
Our familiar leader, Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, clearly stated that democracy is not an unprecedented concept.
During this 25-year visit, this institution has created an ideal and trusted atmosphere among the people.
I think this is a very impressive event for the healthy society, the best democratic values.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been constituted in 26 states along with National Human Rights Activities.
As a society, we need to understand and work towards human rights, which is the basis for the development of everybody and everybody.
My dear countrymen, if the birthday of Jaiprakash Narayan takes place in the month of October, it will not be remembered if the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijayraj Singh starts.
These great personalities are inspired by us and they bow down to them.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb is a celebration of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb in Manki Baat next few years, but it is reminded that on 31st October, a competition is being organized in all the small towns, villages and streets of India by the name of 'Run For Unity'.
This year, the Runfor Unit will be organized in our villages, streets, cities and towns.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the entire nation.
Through the run-for-unity programme on 31st October, we have to emphasize on our efforts to focus on all sections of society and all the elements of the country on the slope of unity.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat August, 2018
Today, the country is celebrating the Raksha Bandhan.
Many good wishes to all the people on this pilgrimage.
Raksha Bandhan is believed to be a symbol of each other's love and trust.
This festival has been an important example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories that depict the people of both different countries and religions.
Within a few days, the festival of Janmashtami will come.
My best wishes to all the people on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, On the day of Sakshabandhan and Saravana Purnima, Sanskrit Day is celebrated.
I extend my best wishes to all those who are involved in the development of this great heritage and bringing it to the common people.
While Tamil is the oldest language in the world, we are proud of the fact that since the Vedic times, Sanskrit and Sanskrit have played a very big role in the propagation of knowledge.
You will be happy to know that the people of Mattur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still talking in Sanskrit language.
So, in any microscopic sense or matter can be explained smoothly.
It is easier to understand that it is linked to our soil and our heritage.
For example, in order to convey the importance of Guru in life, one-time lettermaster Guru.
Sarvapalli recalls Radhakrishnan.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as a teacher day throughout the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the day of their coming.
At the same time, I congratulate you for your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, our hard-working farmers come with new hopes for years.
Rainfall of rotten plants and trees and dry reservoirs in extreme summers is comfortable.
But sometimes there's a rich and destructive flood.
Nature is in a state where there is more rain than it is.
We have seen that the terrible floods in Kerala have suffered very severe losses in life.
Today, the whole country is with Kerala in this dilemma.
We have co-existence with those who lost their own.
Even though the loss of lives cannot be solved, hundred and twenty five crore Indians want to ensure that their shoulders are connected with your shoulders during this sadness.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity will recover as soon as possible.
I am confident that Kerala will rise due to the enthusiasm and bravery of the people.
The destruction of accidents is unfortunate.
But we can see how many scenes of humanity are in danger.
Wherever there is an accident, whether it is in Kerala or any other state of Hindustan or in the district or in the region, everybody is doing something in their own way from Kutch to Kamrup to Kanyakumari to normalize the lives of the people.
Every age and every working class contributes to it.
Everyone is ensuring their participation in easing the sufferings of the people of Kerala and sharing their sadness.
We know that the soldiers of the armed forces are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save the people of the flood.
Dear Countrymen, this time Mann Ki Baat was examining the suggestions.
The matter of writing more people from all over the country was Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the beloved one of us.
Kirti from Gaziaabad, Swati from Sonipa, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swap Banerjee from West Bengal, Akshish Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, and many others called upon to write on MyGiov and tell about the various pictures of Atal ji's life.
On August 16, the country and the world heard the death sentence of Atal ji.
14 years ago, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced the gathering.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he had been away from active politics.
The news didn't take place, it didn't appear in public life.
The 10-year gap is very big, but after 16th August, the country and the world have seen that the ten-year period has not been made even a moment in the minds of the common people of India.
The kind of love and respect that had been with Atal ji, the sorrow that spread all over the country shows his great personality.
India will be paid to Atal ji in the name of the first constitutional amendment in 2003.
This transformation made two major changes in Indian politics.
On the one hand, the size of the Cabinet in the States has been fixed at the length of 15 percent of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit fixed by the Prevention of Corruption Act changed one third to two thirds.
In addition, clear guidelines have been set to disqualify the party's transformation.
Over the years, the political culture that has been created by a large cabinet in India has been formed and the formation of the big cabinets was not only partition but also to enjoy political leaders.
Atal ji changed it.
He waited for money and resources.
And more efficiency.
This change has led to a long-term perspective of a person like Atal ji, and our political culture and healthy habit has grown.
Atal ji was a patriot.
During his regime, the budget was changed.
Earlier, after following the traditions of the British, the budget was presented at 5:00 in the evening because it was the time to start the Parliament in England.
Atal ji's budget in 2001, it changed to 5:00 in the evening at 11:00 in the morning.
An independence was created by Indian Flag Code during Atal ji's regime and it was dominated by it in 2002.
The National Flag can be hoisted in public places, so that the departments are involved in it.
It's a good thing. Good luck for democracy.
It will be a great tribute to the healthy democracy, enhancing good habits of democracy, continuous efforts to strengthen democracy, openly carrying forward the discussions.
Reiterating his determination to fulfill his dream of a developed and rich India, I salute Atal ji for all.
A few days ago, the annual session of Parliament ended.
You will be happy to know that the Productivity and Productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and the Rajya Sabha is 74 percent.
Besides the party's interest, all the members passed the Lok Sabha 21 Bills and the Rajya Sabha 14 Bills as a result of their efforts to improve the annual session.
This annual session of Parliament will always be remembered as a celebration of social justice and youth welfare.
At the event, important bills have been passed for the benefit of the youth and the backward communities.
Over the decades, the need to create OBC commissions like the Scheduled Tribes Commission was increasing.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has supplied the commitment to form an OBC commission this time and has given it constitutional authority.
This step will be a step ahead of the goal of social justice.
The Amendment Bill has also been passed in the House for the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will protect the betterment of the Scheduled Tribes and the Scheduled Tribes.
At the same time, it will prevent criminals from committing injustice, and it will fill self-confidence within the community.
No society can bear any kind of injustice and culture against women's power in the country.
The country isn't ready to bear the brutal offenders.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Penal Code Amendment Bill and has been ensured by the Department of Higher Education.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago, after the trial of an adult child in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, in two months.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
The court of Rajasthan also decided so quickly.
The Act will play a crucial role in preventing crimes against women and children.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
But in this session of the Rajya Sabha, it cannot be passed, I am sure that the Muslim women are ensuring that the whole country remains strong enough to renew them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Parliamentarians of the country on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, the focus of crores of people is now on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every day in the morning, in the newspaper, in the television, in the news, in the social media, the Indian sportsperson has achieved the medal.
Asian Games are still running.
Greetings to all the medal winners for the country.
Our daughters are a lot of medal winners for the country and this is a positive sign.
Young sportspersons from 15-16 years of age are also present.
It is a good sign that most of the medal winners live in small streets and villages, who have achieved this success through hard work.
I once again congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and hope that the rest of the sportspersons have a good show.
Many good wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Namaskar Bhavnaji, I respect the child's thinking.
We have seen buildings and houses with stones and rocks, but about 1200 years ago, you can imagine that there was an excellent, wide and wonderful temple of a single rock.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamilnadu is similar where this incredible combination of architecture and engineering can be seen.
The Westerners, who are known as Rani Kyi Vav, built in the eleventh century at the place of Pan in Gujarat, will be surprised.
India's land was an engineering experiment.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
He is a priest in that part of the country and reminds him of great respect and self-confidence throughout the rest of the country.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, engineers of our country have shown their different personality around the world.
Now when we celebrate Engineer's Day, we have to think about the future.
There's a workshop.
Today, Disaster Management has become a big thing.
The world is facing natural evils.
What shape should structural engineering be
How can we determine the prediction in creating a wasteless manufacturing
We have to think of many such things while celebrating an engineering day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July, 2018
India's diversity and diversity shows sometimes the love of rain.
But why are we blaming the rain
V.
In Thailand, the football player took the team of 12 children to the cave while dragging their coach.
It takes a few hours to go inside the cave and get out.
Because they didn't find any other way, they searched a rock inside the cave - it wasn't one or two days, but for seventeen days.
If the children don't see death in front of them, you can imagine how those moments will be when they have to live directly every moment.
On the one hand, they were straightening the danger, and on the other hand, human values were gathering together in the world.
People all over the world were praying to get these children safely.
But when the good news finally arrived, it was peaceful and happy all over the world.
But I think I can see this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in the mission as a team.
I think it's a matter of reading and understanding everybody's reconciliation.
A young man from Thailand's Navy had to sacrifice this venture.
Despite such a difficult situation, it is surprising in the world that they haven't hoped with so patience and forgiveness in a dark cave full of water.
It shows that miracles happen when humanity is mixed together.
Respect, faith, determination and self-confidence were the speciality of the poems of Neeraj ji.
Everything that we have said to Indians will be very powerful and inspirational.
You have to finish dark.
Neeraj ji pays homage.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is true.
I have been a student of the first year in Delhi University this year.
During our school borrowed exams, we talked about the stress and education of your exams and what is your message to students like me
The month of July and August is very important for the farmers and for the youth.
Because it's called the Peak season of colleges.
This is the time when millions of young people, like the truth, get out of school and go to college.
If February and March go to the test papers and answers, then April May is the time to play the holidays, and to wait for the results, to decide the future direction in life and to choose the career.
The children come from the shadow of their parents to the shadow of professionals.
I am confident that my young friends will be very excited and happy from the beginning of college life.
First of all, we're out of the house, we're out of the village, we'll have to get out of a safe environment and be justified.
Such a number of youngsters leave their homes for the first time and come out to give a new direction to life.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will be ready to join.
I want to tell you, enjoy life, enjoy the pleasure of the soul in life.
There is no way but through books, it should be learned, but there should be a habit to find new things.
The price of old friends is very big.
Children's friends are unprecedented, but it is a matter of utmost consciousness that finds, creates and maintains new friends.
Search something new, get new new talents and learn new languages.
Now, while talking about the college season, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh was witnessing how to overcome the challenges facing the life of Asharam Chaudhari.
In such a situation, there are many students who have been inspired by the poor families, from the challenges faced by the environment, but by dedicating themselves to their own self-determination and dedication.
Father is the driver of DTC, Prince Kumar of Delhi, Abhay Gupta under the street light in Footpath, Kolkata, the daughter of Afreen Shaikh, the autorickshaw driver of Ahmedabad, and the daughter of Nagpur, daughter Khushi, a school bus driver, a cartilage of Haryana, and Ramesh Saheb of Jharkhand, who is working in favor of his father.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country inspires my heart.
It was possible that once I was interacting with Indian youth at Sanjos Nagar, known as Technological Hub, USA.
I would like to tell them how to use their capabilities for India.
I called upon the brain drine to be converted into brain gene.
Two IIT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahajji and Rajneesh Wajpayee, have made a different attempt to accept my challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji simultaneously constructed the Smart Gauge App using their professional scissors.
This app is not only linking the people of the village to the world, but they also know any information and information on their own mobile.
The villagers, the village chiefs, the district magistrates and the CDOs, in the village of Taudhakpur in Rai Barelli, inspired the people to use this app.
The App is doing something that brings digital revolution in the village, records, tracks and monitors all the developmental activities in the village are easier.
The App includes phone directory, news session, invention list, health centre and informatic centres in the village.
The App is very beneficial for the farmers and the App's Grameen Feature and the Fact Rate between the farmers is in a way beneficial for their products.
If you look at this thing then the young man will see that he lives in the United States and his lifestyle and thoughts and will leave India several years ago, but the whole of his village knows the challenges, understands the challenges and the village has an ethnic connection.
But sometimes because of lack of time, sometimes because of the distance, sometimes the thin layer of the circumstance covers it, but if a small wind touches it, everything emerges once more, it is brought to the past.
"Santoshji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Surely Pampur Wari is a very amazing pilgrimage .
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is celebrated on July 23 this year.
Pumperpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15-20 days before Asha Ekadashi, newsers i.e. pilgrims walk on foot along with the teeth of Parpur.
Millions of newspapers participate in this journey called Wari.
Pilgrims reach there to visit Vithoba, Lord Vithoba, which is called Vithoba and Pandunga.
God loves the poor, the destitute, the oppressed, the oppressed.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have tremendous respect and devotion.
Going to the Vitthoba Temple in Mandir and its magnificence, beauty and spiritual joy are a different experience.
If I get the opportunity to tell the listeners of Manki Baat, I would like to attend Parpur Variya once.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukkaram, innumerable renovations are being made available to the common people in Maharashtra even today.
This sanyas tradition continues to inspire every corner of India to fight against dark respect.
There is a message of harmony, love and brotherhood from all the traditions related to it.
There is a mantra to fight society with respect to blind respect.
The man of the world was a patience and self-confidence.
He had the power to mislead British rulers and wisdom.
The British were afraid of him as he tried to reinforce the treason thrice in twenty years.
That's not a small thing.
I would like to present a funny event in front of you about Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Ahmedabad arrived in October, 1916, about a hundred years ago, more than 40,000 people came here to welcome him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to speak to him during this visit.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very impressed by the World Tilak.
Naturally, the British were dissatisfied with this, and the factor continued to reject it.
But Sardar Saheb Sardar Saheb was a brother and he stood firm and had to give up his position, but he was sure to establish a statue of the people of the world.
The statue was finally built and inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi, not by anyone else on 28th February, 1929.
The festival of Ganesh has been started as a result of the efforts of the people of the world.
The festival of Ganesh became a strong medium of enhancing social awakening, social integrity, dedication and equality among the people, as well as celebrating the festival with traditional respect and respect.
It was a time to fight against the British in the country.
It is evident from this that our ancient heritage and our brave men of history are still interested in our young generation.
Today, you can see the Ganesh pillars in many cities and streets.
This is a great opportunity for our youth to learn about leadership and institutional awareness and to develop their capabilities.
This time, from the statue of Ganesh ji, all the decoratives should be environment friendly and every city should be a competition for the environment friendly Ganesh festival.
I'm gonna get these things to the people.
The people of the world, by creating self-confidence among the people, by making a madrama, Swaraj is our primitive and will achieve it.
Even today, it is time to say that Swaraj is our pride and we will achieve it.
All Indians should have good results of governance and development.
This is the creation of a New India.
After 50 years of Tilak's birth, the same day, that is, on 23rd July, another son of Bharatamba was born.
He sacrificed his life by describing us as the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
There will be a young man in India who cannot be inspired by these verses and inspired many young people like Sarfroshi Ki Tamana Ab Hamre Dil Me Haidekhana High George Kittana, Baju-e-Kaat, Ashfaq Ulah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azads courage and his enthusiasm for freedom became inspired by many youths.
Azad lived, but never bowed his head in foreign rule.
Just a few days back, in the Junior Under 20 World Athletic Championship held in Finland, Indias brave lady, farmer Hima Das, made history by winning a gold medal at a 400-meter walk competition.

Mann Ki Baat, June, 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was conducted in Bangalore.
You can clearly understand that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
In this game, both teams performed well.
Bowler Rashid Khan from Afghanistan also showcased a good performance in the IPL this year.
I remember, the President of Afghanistan, Shriman Ashraf Ghani, tweeted, "The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for preparing a platform to showcase their capabilities to our players.
Rashid Khan is the greatest player in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done something that is a model for the whole world.
When the Indian team took the trophy, the Afghan team, which participated in the first international competition, took photographs together.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will continue to play with Sportsman Spirituality.
Dear Countrymen, the fourth Yoga Day, which was held on 21st June, presented a different sight.
I see the whole world becomes united.
The soldiers of India and China simultaneously practiced Yoga at the high snow covered peak of Ladakh.
Yoga is going to destroy all the boundaries and bring people together.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from more than 100 countries have made this festival a big festival without any change in caste, religion, region, color, women and men.
It is natural for people from all over the world to participate in Yoga Day programmes with so much enthusiasm.
It is a matter of great pride for the country that hundreds of twenty five crore people have performed Yoga on the protectors and water-colors of our country.
Some Veerasiniks performed yoga at International Vehicle and some were practicing Yoga on the snow-clad mountains of Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force suspended all of them in the midst of the sky, at a height of 16,000 feet from the Earth.
They were swimming in the sky and don't seem to be on the plane.
Yoga was conducted in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports places.
Yoga has united people across castes, religions and regions across the globe and for centuries we have believed in Vasudhaiva Kumbh.
Our shrines, monks and other archaeologists have shown that Yoga has actually brought it to the forefront.
Most people will make it part of their lives.
Dear Countrymen, many of my Geovi and Narendra Modi App have written to tell me about Doctors Day coming to Mann Ki Baat this year on July 1.
That's right.
Remember the doctor only when we get a problem.
But this is a day that will bring our doctors' achievements and this is an opportunity to thank them for their service and dedication to the society.
The role of the doctor is not only in treating the disease.
Today, the doctor has the privilege of treatment, and he has a great experience of how to influence our normal lifestyle.
With their talent and talent, Indian doctors have enriched their personality throughout the world.
The heads of the medical sector are also known to address problems related to hard work and diagnosis.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to our doctor friends on the occasion of Doctors Day on 1st July.
My dear countrymen, we are lucky to be born in this land.
India has a rich history that is not a month or a day without any history.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true I'm coming to Maghar on the twentieth.
Do you know why he went to Magahar
There was a belief that those who die in Magahar would not have received heaven.
On the other hand, those who die in Kashi will receive heaven.
Magahar was considered indecent, but Saint Kabir didn't believe it.
In today's era, they are so inspiring.
That is, the real pious saint knows and understands the pain of others.
No one knows the pain of others is humble.
At that time, there was a constraint and constraint in the world and he made a message of peace and harmony.
The world worked together to remove opinions.
His words are true even after centuries.
There is a Guru Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
He has shown the way to millions and has been inspiration for centuries.
Guru Nanak Dev taught us to eradicate caste differences in society and to transform humanity.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, "God is worshipped by the poor and the poor.
In 2019, Guru Nanak Dev's 57th Prakash Parv will be celebrated.
I want all of us to be a part of it with enthusiasm and zeal.
I would like to appeal to you all that the fifth light of Guru Nanak Dev is to think about new ideas, new ideas, new ideals and new ideals about how to celebrate the society and the world.

Shyam Prasad is the birthplace of Mukherjee.
In this program, he has written to the people about Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.
Thank you very much for the first time.
Dr.
In 1937, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convention of the University of Calcutta in Bengali.
When the British ruled, somebody in the University of Calcutta was the first to speak in Bengali language in the Convention.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development and built a strong platform.
In India's first industrial policy announced in 1948, his ideas and visions have been sealed.
He had a dream that India would achieve professional self-sufficiency in every sphere and that it would be equitable and rich.
He wanted SMEs to pay attention to handicrafts, clothing and drainage industries.
The All India Handicrafts Bord, All India Handloom Bord, Khadi-Village Industries Bord, was established between 1948 and 1950 to provide financial assistance and institutional mechanism for proper development of Half and Small Industries.
Defence manufacturing of India needs indigenously.
Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was the most important thing for India's academy, for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of only 50.
Come on.
People spoke of their imaginations, their griefs and their achievements.
In remote villages, girls provide services from pension to passport to the elderly of the village through public service centres.
A sister from Chhattisgarh makes a ice cream business with cereals.
Like unknown light in Jharkhand, lakhs of young people of the country are providing medicine centres and affordable medicines to nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal was devouring jobs two-thirds years ago and today his own business is successful.
Not only that, it gives jobs to ten thousand and fifty.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as pollution in the tinning lab of school at their young age.
There are some people in the society who don't talk about their disappointing things, and don't try to make unbelief, and find out the ways to disintegrate.
In such an environment, it is not the best of the government when the common man comes with ideas and new enthusiasm and the events that have taken place in his life.
Even the incident of a small child in a small village can be inspired by hundred and twenty five crore people.
With the help of technology, when I spent time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it would have been very comfortable and inspired and inspired to do something.
A new joy and enthusiasm gets a new boost to give life to the poorest of the poor.
I am very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people have been associated with this video bridge and have given me a new strength.
We can also smell good.
Last day, one thing came to my notice, it's a different experience.
He has worked successfully in enhancing the income of the farmers by making schemes related to the farmers.
In a way, farmers have a big share in the entire range from crop production to marketing, and efforts are made to ensure double profits to them by making the farmers share.
For that, the seed bank has been made.
Women look at the things of this Vietnam, and the women are also linked to it.
I knew something, some wouldn't have known it, some would have known it, some wouldn't have known it, but millions of people continuously do some good things and many good wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, it's going to be a year in the gym.
Van Nation One Tax was the dream of the people, it has been really changed today.
People from different political ideology are sitting there, people from different states and people from different states are from different preceding states, but all the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken unanimously.
Before GST, there were several taxes in the country and according to this arrangement only one kind of tax is in the country.
GST is the victory of honesty and this is the festival of honesty.
Earlier, the complaint of Inspector Raj related to tax was raised in the country.
In GSD, ID, Information Technology and Informatics have been replaced by Inspector.
From retrench to refund, everything goes online through informal technology.
GST was perhaps the worlds largest tax reform programme.
This is because the people of the country have adopted such a huge tax reform in India and the success of GST can be achieved through the strength of the people.
It was generally believed that such a big reform would take 5-7 years to achieve the full success of such a large country.
Mann Ki Baat, May, 2018
Namaskar.
Yes, I want to tell you something about them.
These six daughters of India, their team, have returned to India on May 21, after roaming around the world on the INSV floor in the sea for more than twenty-two days.
The whole country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to see these daughters and listen to their travel experiences.
Once again, I would like to congratulate the people of India, especially the women of India, not very bad to enhance the bravery of those daughters, to enhance the bravery of the Navy.
Nobody's brave.
If we look at the development journey of humanity, we can see that progress has been made from the pregnancy of any adventure.
Development is in the lap of adventure.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children of a Ashram School in Maharashtra, Manisha Dhru, Pramesh Ale, Umakanta Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam, reached the highest peak in the world.
These children of Ashram School were trained in August 2017, which were trained at Vardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were elected under Massin Sharva.
They were proud of the country by climbing Everest as per the name.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to those who are associated with Chandrapur school.
This is the next time, Shivangi Pathak, 16, was the youngest Indian girl to climb Everest from Nepal.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those brave men, especially women.
They're tagging each other and challenging them.

If we fit, India and Fit...
Virad Kohli, captain of the Indian cricket team, has also challenged me and I have accepted his challenge and this is a good thing.
Such challenges will encourage us to be fit and others to be fit.
My dear countrymen, you have heard something about sports, sportspersons and sportspersons in Mann Ki Baat.
Last time the heroes of Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme.
Thank you very much for your call.
It's true that the games played in every street, which were part of the lives of all children, are coming down today.
These games were particularly part of summer.
Sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes in the night, after dinner, the kids were playing for hours with their hearts.
Outdoor and Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these games.
The same game is known in different names at different places.
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chomal-Isto.
It's played with a square, or a pigeon or a square 8:8 square square board.
This game was often played in all the states.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara, in Madhya Pradesh, and in Kerala, there were several names like Bakti in Kerala, Chambal in Maharashtra, or Daily Sports in Tamil Nadu and Changapo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you know, people from all over the country don't know the language, huh
It's said we're not sports.
Those who don't play kids and kids in childhood.
Children and Koll are playing games in villages and towns.
It was called by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it was called Godibila or Karra Billa.
It's called Gulibadi in Odisha, which is called Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own weather, season.
As seasonal to fly the city.
When everybody blows the city, when everybody plays, the different qualities of ours are expressed without any hesitation.
The bigger looks serious, but when they play, the child hiding in them comes out.
Our individual thinking, concentration, awakening, spurt etc. encouraging conventional sports with physical talent.
We also know our culture and heritage.
Many games make us aware of society and the environment.
Calling people, we can create a large history collection of our traditional games.
This time theme is to defeat plastic waste - Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you to understand the feelings of this theme and not to use polytechnic, low quality plastic, we can try to reduce the impact of plastic pollution on the nature, on wildlife and on our health.
See, know and try to implement the World Environment Day website in a very attractive manner in Wed-India 2018.
When it gets very hot, when the rain doesn't end, everybody starts calling Global Walking, Climate Changing like experts.
But what's going to happen if you just say it
These are basically climate change, the result.
Our culture, our heritage taught us not to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi promised for this in life and in all directions.
Today, India speaks of climate justice, India has played a key role in the POP-21 Paris Agreement and we have united the world through International Solar Alliance.
How can we move in this matter
What can you do
It's rainy season.
It has been reported that preparations are being held to celebrate International Yoga Day on 21st June across the world.
Yoga For Unit for Unity has been re-considering the world over the past few years.
By doing yoga, we always have the courage to see us like a father.
If all these qualities are friends, then Yoga is successful in every kind of fear.
I once again appeal to all the people that Yoga will create a healthy, prosperous and well-being nation to promote our heritage.
Dear Countrymen, today is 27th May, the memory of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.
Promise to Panditji...
This month's memories are connected to another person, Veer Savarkar.
In May, 1957, Indians showcased their strength to the British.
In 1857, Veerasavarkar wrote indeed that it was not a joke but the first fight for freedom.
Savarkar's life was very peculiar.
But, beyond that, he was a great poet and a social reformer, who always gave importance to responsibilities and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee has given a very good description of the society.
The sovereign poetry and revolution took place together.
Besides being a sensitive poet, the adventurous revolutionary too.
If there is an intensity to do something, then it can be achieved through all the bonds.
It's not just a matter of Seeker, you can see it every corner of India.
If you look around, you can see how people lose their rivalry.
While we still go to a tea chamber, we must have noticed that some of the discussions and discussions are close.
These discussions can be related to politics, social, films, sports and sportspersons, the problems of the country, the problem, the solution to this kind of solution...
You will be surprised to know that he is the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school called Asha-Ashwasan for children living in streets and ghettos, for which the poor teaman spends 50 percent of his income.

I'm D.
A lot of congratulations to the leadership and dedication of Prakash Rao and giving a new direction to the lives of poor children.
He has made the darkness of their lives free.
There'll be many such things happening next to you.
There will be innumerable events.

He'll wait for the moon a few days.
Everyone believes that this festival will be celebrated with great enthusiasm, especially the children will receive good gifts.
Eid hopes to strengthen our society's friendship and harmony.
Many good wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
Maybe next month in Manki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th to 15th April.
71 countries, including India, participated in it.
When such a big event takes place, you can imagine what will happen when thousands of players from all over the world participate.
Who can avoid this in an environment consisting of excitement, excitement, hope and determination to achieve.
India's record improvement in shooting, wrestling and weightlifting, table tennis and badminton has been shown.
India has secured 66 medals including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze.
This victory will be proud of all Indians.
Everything will be in the same shape.
In order to make it clear, the words will be forgotten directly.
But I'd like to hear you from those games.
It was my dream that India and Manipur were not the only players.
Do you know that all the restaurants who went to India this time have won the medal
Manika Batra won all the medals that they attended.
She is the first Indian woman to achieve gold medal for India in personal table tennis.
India has the highest medal shooting.
Fifteen-year-old shooter Anish Bhanwala is the youngest sportsperson in the Commonwealth Games to get gold medal for India.
Sachin Chaudhari is the only Para Power Lifter in Commonwealth Games for India.
This time more than those who have received the medal are women.
Whether it's a squash, boxing, weight lifting, or shooting, women are wonderful.
The last fight in Badminton is two Indian sportspersons Saina Nehwal and P.
Sindhu was in the middle.
Everyone was keen to get both the medals for India, despite the competition.
The sportspersons involved in the games went from different parts of the country, from small towns.
In every environment, their friends also have their strength.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I invited people, especially the youth, to fit India.
Come and collaborate with Fit India and invite Fit India.
I am happy that people join it with great enthusiasm.
Shearing his own picture in the swimming pond of Shashikant Bhosle, My webn is my body, My Elmont is water, My Wald is swimming...
Fit India is a journey and trekking for me.
It is heartening to see many well-known people inspire our youth for fit India in a very attractive manner.
The filmmaker Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
And you must see that he's exercising with the Wooden bed.
He says this exercise is very good for outer and stomach muscles.
There's another video.
He's playing volleyball with people in it.
Many young people have shared their experiences related to Fit India initiatives.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for us and all over the country.
One more thing is to say, the name of the poor Fit India Movement is Yoga.
Yoga has a special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have started preparations.
The importance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been accepted throughout the world.
You're ready now.
Not alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your college, everywhere, everybody, every age, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, every woman, everywhere should try to connect with Yoga.
Today, there is no need to say that Yoga is beneficial for the entire development of the body, for the mental development and for the mental balance.
You must have seen my animated video is very popular.
They've been showing a teacher very minutely by animation.
You will also get the benefit.
I want to tell you something by inviting you for a new job.

My young friends, I invite you to a special internship.
Three Ministries of the Government of India - Sports, Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water have started a Swachh Bharat Summer Index 2018 together.
If the students of college, the NCC youth, the NSS and the Nehru Yuva Kendra Vendors want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to become a reason for the change of society then they can join it.
This will give support and strength to cleanliness, and it will be happy that when Mahatma Gandhi celebrated the centenary birthday of 2nd October, something could be done before that.
The best participants, those who have done good work in colleges and those who have done good work in the University will receive awards at the national level.
Not only that, the UGC will give two credit points to those who perform well.

Use this holiday for a new experience.
We would like to appeal to the people to see that how many people are doing good things in every corner of our country and how good things are happening.
I saw the story of the youngsters who have gathered unemployedly for the education of poor children.
In collaboration with these youngsters, a massive programme of education has been undertaken for the children of the teeth and children living in their homes.
They were caught on the roads, indiscriminatory or in smaller jobs, so they descended for this activity.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this program have been trying to transform social transformation into two hours from their busy life.
Brothers and sisters, Just like this, some farmers from the hilly areas of Uttarakhand will be inspired by the farmers across the country.
They changed the fate of not only their own but also the region.
Ragi, Chaulai, cereals or barley are mainly farming in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
Due to being a hilly area, the farmers didn't get the price dedicated to them.
This biscuit of iron is very beneficial for pregnant women.
These farmers formed a cooperative body in Munar village and started a BScat factory.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the government also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now reaching not only in Bageshwar district but also at 50 Anganwadi centres, Almora and Kaisani.
With the support of the farmers, the annual sale of the team has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakh, but more than 900 families are getting jobs due to lack of employment from the district.
Don't we think water conservation is a social responsibility
Think how to protect every rainbow.
We know that water conservation is not a new issue in the minds of Indians.
Not the subject of the book, not the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived it for centuries.
They predicted the importance of water and water.
They looked for new ways to keep every drop of water safe.
There are large rocks in Manar Koval, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovalpatty and New Kotai and many ponds are like tourist centres even today.
But do not forget that these big relevances of water conservation are the living examples of our ancient efforts.
The ponds, which are known as Rani Ki Bawadi in Adalaj and Patna in Gujarat, are the world heritage centres of UNESCO, which are worth seeing.
These ponds are water temples in a way.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbadi in Jodhpur.
This is one of the largest and most beautiful Bawdis (Kulum) in India, which is in a water-watered area.
April, May, June and July are the best time to harvest the rain water and we will also get the benefit as we prepare and prepare.
In the last three years, everybody has done some things in their own way in water conservation and water management.
In terms of 2017-18, Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on affordable water conservation worth Rs. 55 per cent.
In the last three years, such water conservation and water conservation have resulted in more than 150 lakh hectares of land.

Rabindranath was a talented personality, a manifestation.
I had the habit of listening, but I didn't know the language, but I got up in the morning and listened to Ravindra Sangeet in Radio...
Rabindra Sangeeth and his poems may have been very impressed.
I salute Rabindranath Tagore on this occasion.
Rumsfeld is celebrated with respect and respect throughout the world.
The social aspect of fasting is that when man is hungry, he knows the hungry of others.
The others feel thirsty when they feel thirsty.
Once a man asked the prophet what is the best thing in Islam.
The prophet replied, "Any poor or hungry person gives food and behave with all you know or with all you know.
People give gifts to those who devote this month.
According to Prophet Mohammad, a person is rich because of a sacred soul and not riches.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who has shown the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, and he has guided millions of people across the globe.
This Buddha Purnima recalls our responsibility to travel through the path shown by Lord Buddha, to take determination and to live accordingly.
Lord Buddha is the inspirational strength of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Today, this is the most needed human value in the world.
Buddha's inspiration is immense in the social vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb said that my social vision was established in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my sight are in religion, not in politics.
I'm selfish from my master Buddha.
Baba Saheb has empowered millions of people who are oppressed, oppressed, deprived and empowered by the Constitution.
There's no greater example of desert than that.
It was one of the greatest features of Lord Buddha.
The advice of Lord Buddha is traditionally available everywhere in Asia.
I am happy to note that the Government of India has partnered in revival of many Buddhist temples, including the centuries-old magnificent Ananda Temple of Myanmar.
Today, there is a sight of conflict and human suffering around the world, and Lord Buddha's advice guides us to relieve hate.
I convey my best wishes to Lord Buddha to all the people of the world who believe in the principles of compassion.
Lord Buddha prays for the blessings of Lord Buddha to fulfil my responsibility for the creation of a peaceful, deserving world based on his advice for the entire world.
There was a new self-confidence for the people of India spread all over the world.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1998, analysis was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan on the west coast of India.
It's been twenty years since Lord Buddha's blessings that Buddha had done on the day of Buddha Purnima.
India's experiment was successful and India has shown talent in science and technology.
The day is marked as an exhibition of military strength in the Indian Ocean.
Lord Buddha showed the world that the power of the soul is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when you get strength as a nation, you will be able to live peacefully.
It is very important not only for a manipulation in the month of May, 1998 but also for the country to do so.
India's land is a land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India has shown the world that it will sweep new goals and goals and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave a mantra, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan...
We can experience a new joy and a new joy in taking forward the journey that Atal ji started.
My dear countrymen, I'll see you again in Mann Ki Baat, so I'll tell you more.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is Ramnavami's pious day.
My best wishes to all on this holy day of Ramnavami.
We have seen how much Ramanama's strength was in the life of a sacred father.
On 26th January, all the dignitaries from the ASEAN countries were here, with whom they brought it together with the cultural unions of the countries.
I once again wish you all the good wishes of Ramnavami.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every time, your letters, e-mails, phone calls and suggestions have been received in large quantities.
I have read about the online course of Sanskrit in Communal Thakur MyGov.
I am glad to see you, a rich IT professional, a cultured love.
In this direction, the department has been told to bring information about the efforts taken in this direction.
I also appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat, who worked with Sanskrit to take the advice of Community forward.
You invite everybody to keep water for birds in summer.
Shakal ji, I've got your feelings in all the listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresh ji says that I want to tell the youth about their health.
He feels that our young people are physically weak when they are cheating with ASEAN countries.
The photographs of the Union Government have been shared by the Narendra Modi App and the Social Media.
Like it, reweet it, bring it to friends.
Anagha, Jaisal from Chennai, and many children have written in the book 'Exam Warrior' and have written in the book 'Gratitude Cards'.
Many things touched my heart with so many letters, so many phone calls and opinions that I read...
I'll have to talk for months even if I talk about them.
In summer, it's about the water of birds and animals.
Brothers and sisters, There are letters from farmers about the Kisan Melas and farming across the country.
Some wise people have suggested water conservation.
Festivals will contain letters about our festivals, our culture and our traditions.
In these experiences, such inspiration, energy, self-confidence, and the passion for doing something for the country are filled with this experience.
This involves the strength of climate change throughout the country.
When I can understand that Ahmed Ali, a resident of Karingch, Assam, has created 9 schools for the poor children with the strength of his will, I can see the unparalleled will power of this country.
When Dr. Ajit Mohan Chaudhari of Kanpur went to the footpath and heard the story of checking the poor and giving them free medicines, there was an opportunity to understand the people of this country.
Due to lack of treatment 13 years ago, Calcutta car driver Saidul Laskar's sister died.
After twelve years of this kind of money, the efforts made by the Saidul Laskar finally showed clearly.
Due to his hard work and determination, a hospital of 30 beds has been constructed in Puri village near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, the perspective of India has changed to the world.
It has been believed that we are moving forward amongst the people of all walks of life and our country is moving forward.
This self-confidence, this positivity will help in realizing our vision of a New India, and will be dreamable.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
Because of this, many letters have come from farming.
This time I saw the video of discussions with farmers on the DD Kisan channel, all the farmers should be connected to the DD Kisan channel.
The idea of how much Mahatma Gandhi was interested in soil, farming and farming and farmers is evident in this line, he added.
Similarly, Lal spoke strongly about the preservation of trees, plants and plants, and the need to absorb good farming practices.
Ram Manohar Lohia said that a large number of people need to be awakened to improve improved income, improved water conservation facilities, ensure that food and milk are generated.
In one of his speeches in 1979, Chaudhary Charansingh called upon the farmers to use new technology and make new inventions.
I went to the farming festivities held in Delhi last day.
I had a very comfortable experience of knowing, understanding, understanding and knowing new inventions related to agriculture, including my discussions with farmers brothers and scientists.
But I was most impressed by the Meghalaya and the traders there.
This state, which is very small, has shown great work.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have produced records in 2015-16 compared to the previous five years.
In my detail, when I consider the MSP, the cost of affordable subsidies, the cost of their four quarters, the machines or the cost of the machine, the cost of the seed, the cost of all kinds of currencies, the cost of irrigation, the cost of the state estate, the cost of the actual repayment, the cost of the sowing of the soil... not only the rent, but also the blindness of the farmers who are blind in the field of self-reliant farming.
Besides, a large number of works are being done for the agricultural market reforms in the country to get a fair price for the farmers.
Efforts are being made to connect rural markets with holseil markets and global markets.
My dear countrymen, this year the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi will be celebrated.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our determination.
Besides this, hundred and twenty five crore people will join hands with their shoulders and pay the best tribute to Gandhiji.
I'm asking you all to share your opinion through my GOV.
What should be the Logo of Gandhi 150
Slogan, the mantra, or what should be the celebration
Today, in the health sector, the country has moved ahead with traditional methods.
Everything related to health in the country was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health.
Today, all departments and ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Swachhta or the Ministry of AYUSH, whether it is the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, are working together for healthy India, and are giving importance to health care at affordable costs with defence measures.
Prohibition is the cheapest and easiest healthcare.
As far as we are aware of the disease resistance, the person, family and society will be benefitted.
If life is to be healthy, then first it's clean.
We all took a challenge in the form of a nation, resulting in double the sensitization coverage within 4 years, almost 80 percent.
Besides, there has been widespread work on creating healthcare centres throughout the country.
Today Yoga has turned into a birthplace and has come home because of our dedication to everyone.
This time, the International Day of Yoga will be 100 days left to reach June 21.
On the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the country and across the world have participated with enthusiasm.
We should ensure that this time we will make ourselves Yoga and inspire the entire family, friends and everyone to do Yoga.
In a new attractive way to do Yoga, inspire children, youngsters, elderly people.
There are several programmes related to Yoga throughout the year on TV and electronic media.
Can you create awakening about Yoga as an initiative from now on to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I'll share that video with you... so we can learn asanas and pranayama together.
They'll be helpful.
Heart patients have reduced the rate of heart stent to 85 percent.
The price of egg transplant has also been reduced by 50 to 70 percent.

My dear countrymen, Dr.
Baba Saheb is the birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
Years ago Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar said about the industrialization of India.
For him, the industry was a good medium of providing jobs to the poor and the poor.
Today, when we successfully launch the Make in India initiative in the country, Dr.
With this vision, Smart Cities Mission and Urban Cities Mission have been launched in the country today, all kinds of facilities in big cities and small towns of the country, whether it is good roads or water, healthcare or education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance.
He wanted a person not to live in poverty every day.
At the same time, he believed that their poverty could not be eliminated only because he gave a boost to the poor.
Today, the beginnings like Mudra Yojana, Startup India and Standup India are giving birth to our young friends.
The Prime Minister emphasized the use of water for the development of the country and the various river valley authorities and water related commissions were born in the vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, efforts are being made to reduce history for waterways and ports in the country.
He emphasized the need to work together between the Centre and the States for the development of the Federal System.
He showed us that it is not necessary to live in a larger or richer family to reach higher levels, but to see the dreams of the poor families in India and to achieve success and to achieve those dreams.
Baba Saheb has played Ambedkar.
Similarly, there will be special programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice in India.
I appeal to all of you to actively participate in these programmes.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are coming in the coming days and Lord Mahavir's Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaishali.
Lord Mahavir's Jayanti is a memorable day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavir Ji, the messenger of Ahimsa, will inspire us all.
My best wishes to all the people.
He recalls the inspirational advice of Jesus Christ when he spoke of Ester, and gave the message of peace, responsibilities, justice and compassion to mankind.
In April, Vaishali will be celebrated in Punjab and West India.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science.
We see the colour of the sea blue, but we understand from our experience that water is not colored.
Have we ever thought why the water in the river or the sea looks colorful
The same question came to mind a young man in 1920s.
This is the question that a scientist was born in modern India.
Now, when we talk about science, India is the first.
One of his findings is known as Raman IFFAKT.
Because this is the day he found out the truth of light scattering, so he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the science sector.
Scientists like Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana and Satyendranath Bose are proud of India.
The Boson Particle, popularly known as Satyendra Nath Bose, has been given the name.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a function in Mumbai and inaugurated the Wizards Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was very happy to know about the miracles in the science sector.
Artificial Intelligence helps manufacture robots, bottoms and other specific mechanises.
Now machines smash their own brains through self-leaning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence can be helpful in facilitating the lives of Divyang (Ang limited) brothers and sisters.
Can we know more about natural evils through artistic intelligence
Can the farmers help anything about agricultural production
Does Artificial Intelligence help in facilitating delivery of healthcare to all and treatment of diseases in modern ways
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the inauguration of the I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There's a young man about developing a digital device.
I think many such things can use arteficial intelligence.
Scientific Intellectual Value neutral.
Any machine we want will work.
But it depends on us what we want to do with machine.
Thomas Alva Edison, who had discovered the lighting bulb, failed many times in his experiment.
Once asked about this, he replied: 'I have searched for ten thousand ways to find Bulb.
Edison has also strengthened his defeats.
Unfortunately, fortunately, I am in Aravalli, the Karmabhoomi of Maharshi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and raised many questions to British India.
The idea of questioning again and again to know the truth is important.
This is the real inspiration behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't you sit quiet until you get answers to questions.
On this occasion of National Science Day, greetings to scientists and others associated with science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages about all issues related to safety and oppression during the crisis. People write something related to it to me.
Shri Ravindra Singh, from Pune, has been commanded by the Narendra Modi Mobile App for the safety of employment.
He has written that security standards are not good in our country where factory and construction work is going on.
The next 4th March is the National Security Day of India, so he suggested that people should talk about security in the Prime Minister's Mann Ki Baat programme to be aware of security.
When we talk about the safety of the public, two things are very important and the precedents and the preconditions.
One needed at the time of danger - Safety During Disaster - second in daily life - Safety in Everide Life .
If we are not aware of security in everyday life, if we are not aware then it is difficult to happen when there is a danger.
We must have written several times on the boards that see the way - if you don't wake up, risk will certainly be a wrong loss, joy and laugh, so quickly ensure safety without leaving the world.
I would like to say that the Fire Brigades of the Fire Brigade cities should visit schools once a week or once a month and showcase the motors in front of the children.
So, there will be two benefits, the Fire Brigade will have an awakening habit and the new generation will be able to know about it.
In terms of danger, India is a country full of geographical and climate change.
This country has witnessed a number of disasters such as natural calamities, chemical calamities and business accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) stands in the forefront of the dangers faced by the country.
The NDMA is at a rapid pace for rescue operations in various accidents like earthquakes, floods, thunderstorms and landslides.
Two-thirds years ago, the heat-heat woven caused thousands of people to lose their lives.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat decreased to nearly 220.
We can understand that if we give precautions to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people doing such acts in the society, there are social organizations and citizens who are aware and I congratulate all those who reach the rescue routes within minutes when there is a danger.
The number of such unknowing heroes is not less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, the Armed Forces, the Paramilitary Forces, and the brave and brave people help the people without causing their lives.
We have to make a society that warns of danger.
In our culture, we look at values and talk of security values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it part of our lives.
In our normal life, we are traveling hundreds of times on a plane, and we see that air hostess in the air warns of security in the beginning.
We must have heard it hundreds of times, but somebody took us to the plane and said, if you ask me where everything is, where's life jacket
So, our ears are in the air, but we don't even think these warnings are me.
This is how it takes place in every field of life.
We shouldn't think that security is for anyone else.
If we all are aware of our safety then the feeling of security of society will also be included in it.
Dear countrymen, this time, with the objective of Swachh Bharat in the budget, the villages were emphasized on the issue of West-to-West and West-to-Energy from Bayage.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana aims to improve the sanitation of the villages, improve the livelihood of the animals and create wealth and energy through the transformation of the ruins of the farmlands, composta and biogyasa.
The number of four-fourths in India is the highest in the world, where about 300 million four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-foot-four-four-four-four-foot-foot-four-foot-foot-foot-foot-fo
This is also progressing under Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
I invite you to join the Clean Energy and Green Job, and move forward to make the garbage of my village rich and to make the garbage rich.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard about many festivals including music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
However, the state's first Charu Mahotsav was held as a strange initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
The Festival, organised by Raipur City, was aimed at creating awareness about the strange methods of effective use of the city's wastes and renewables.
During this festival, various kinds of programmes were conducted, in which the elderly people participated.
Inspired by the programme of Raipur, different festivals were organized in other districts.
Everyone has done different things in their own way and shared innovative ideas about cleanliness and discussed and recited poems.
The importance of pollution and cleanliness was presented in a very new manner in the festival, which conveys congratulations to the people of Raipur City, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of Chhattisgarh.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
A lot of events are being organized in our country and around the world.
On this day, the women power awards in the country and respect those who have done the following things in different fields.
Today, the country is moving towards womens development beyond womens development.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's words.
He said that the idea of perfect women is completely free and this idea that Swami ji forwarded twenty-twenty years ago shows the understanding of women's power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life which is our responsibility.
Children were known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kausalya-Nandan and Gandhari-Puthan.
Today, our women's strength expresses self-sufficiency and self-confidence through their actions.
As they moved on their own, they moved ahead with the country and society and moved towards a new goal.
Our vision is that our New India is essentially a woman-strong and equitable partnership in the overall development of the country.
This kind of stories that inspire life can be seen in the atmosphere.
I know something from Jharkhand.
According to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand should be remembered that this number is not very low - 15 lakh women constitute Swachhta Abhiyan for a month.
These women in Jharkhand have shown that the Swachhta Abhiyan in ordinary life can transform the culture into the nature of the common people.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, in three villages of Elephanta Island, the news showed that 70 years after Independence, the people there were so happy.
You know that the Elephanta Island is in the sea ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
This is a very attractive tourist destination.
I congratulate the people and the people there.
I am happy that the villages of Elephanta and the caves there will see the light of electricity.
This is not just electrification but also a new beginning of development.
Let the light grow in the lives of the people, pleasure in life... and the moment that gives more happiness and excitement.
Dear countrymen, we celebrated Shivaratri last night.
Now the month of March is the time when the rich farmland and the plenty of wheat, the golden crops and the thrilling flocks of the heart.
And this month, due to the celebration of Holi, it is a dear month for everyone.
On 2 March, everyone will celebrate Holi with Harsholas.
My dear people, thank you very much, greetings.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participated in the festival.
He recalls Kalpana Chaula, who traveled to space, on the 1st of February.
Calpan left us in the danger of the Colombia Space ship, but they have been inspired by millions of young people around the world.
We lost Kalpana Chaula at such a young age and it is a tragedy for us.
It is heartening to see that women in India are moving fast in every field and enhancing the countrys pride.
In ancient times, the dignity of women of our country, their place in the society and their contributions are surprising all over the world.
There is a long tradition of Indian scholars.
This is what we say about Bei Bachao, Bei Padhao.
But in the ancient times, the Scandapuran says: "Shashputra, Samamanya, Dashputra, Kardhanya, the fruits are available, it is beneficial.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons, and you get the reward from ten sons in a daughter.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why women have been given the status of strength in our society.
This women's strength will enhance the entire country, the entire society and the family in the midst of unity.
Whether it is the legacy and devotion of the vedic scholars like Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitrei, or the ruler of Ahlyabai Holkar, or the daring of Rani Laxmibai, the women's strength inspires us.
Increase the dignity of the country.
Shri Prakash Tripakshi has given several examples.
He writes that our adventurous Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is an inspirational flight to Sukhoi 30.
He has written about the world tour in INSV Tarini, women members of the Indian Navy under the leadership of Vartika Joshi.
He will inform the women who are brave, Bhavnakanth, Mohna Singh, who are valuable fighters of the Chaturvedi Eiver war zone and train in Sukhoi 30.
Women led by Tapath Wajpei will be proud to fly to San Francisco, New America, Delhi and Delhi in the Boeing Jet of Air India.
Everyone should remember women...
These women who have been awarded the first lady Marcent Navy captain, the first lady train driver of the Travel Train, the first lady fire fighter, the first lady bus driver, the first lady in Antarctica, the first lady in Everest, the first lady in all such fields, the women who have been awarded for the first time in all such fields have made an extraordinary effort to improve the ecosystem of our women power society.
They waited for all the obstacles and all the obstacles in the strength of their hard work and determination and commitment to a new path.
Not only their contemporaries, but also the inspiration for the generation.
They will fill a new spirit and inspiration.
You will also be able to create a book on these women who have been given the sight of the country, so that the people of the country should know about this women's strength and inspire you and their works in their lives.
This is available for e-Building in the Narendra Modi website.
Womens power has an important role in the active changes in the country and society.
When we talk about women empowerment, we want to tell you about a railway station.
You will be wondering what is the connection between railway stations and women empowerment.
The Maunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India with all the workers.
Empowerment is a form of self-sufficiency.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is a Maoism-affected area.
Himsa, transgressions, bombs, guns and pistols are a terrible atmosphere that the Maoists built there.
In such a horrific area, tribal women have been able to achieve self-sufficiency by running e-ORICS.
A lot of women have been associated with it for a very short time.
With this, it will also strengthen the environmental protection.
Praise the District Heavy and the District Administration has played a vital role in the success of these women till the grant of grants and refinements.
For centuries, the individual and socio-economic efforts have been made in our society against social mischief and evil.
A few days ago, there was a similar start in Bihar.
Thousands of kilometres long, the world's largest human resource to root out social mischief in the state.
Through this campaign, the society awakened the witness against the infirmities such as child marriage and women's tradition.
The state has decided to fight against evils such as women and child marriage.
Young people, mothers and sisters, who are full of enthusiasm and enthusiasm, all themselves became part of this fight.
In the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna, the mankind like the state has been uninterrupted.
In order to achieve the right direction of development, the society must be free from indecency.
Come together, let us pledge to redeem society in the mischief and make a New India, a strong and powerful India.
He had never known about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
When you came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Yojana, when you started buying trees, the cost of death was reduced by 75 percent.
Over the past few days, a lot of people have been writing about it to me.
The objective of this scheme is to enhance the livelihood of the healthcare to anyone.
The trees found at the generic medicine centres are cheaper than 50 to 90 percent of the trees that are sold here.
That's why good trees are available at affordable prices.
There are more than 300 Jan Aushadhi Kendras in the entire country.
There is a new employment opportunity not only for the people who want to find a personal job but also for the people who want to find a job.
The precious trees are available in the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Amrut Stores in hospitals.
The only objective of PIL is to provide healthcare to the poorest of the poor and to create a healthy India.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mangesh, who is in Maharashtra, has shared a photo in the Narendra Modi App.
As per Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the citizens of Akola have organized a cleanliness entrance to clean the Morna river.
The Morna river flows for twelve months before, and Elley flows only during the rainy season.
The river is completely covered with cattle and pulses is painful.
And the river and its shores are driven away.
One day before the Makar Sankranti, the two sides of the Mornan river will be cleaned at four places in the four kilometres of the area as the first step of Mission Clean Mornah on 13th January.
More than 400 people from Akola, more than 100 governmental institutions, college-school students, kids, elderly, mothers and sisters, attended the programme of Mission Clean Morna.
And on 20th January, 2018, it has been said that this programme will continue every Saturday morning until the Morna river is completely cleaned.
It's not impossible if anyone gets out of here to do something.
Big changes can be brought through the population.
Congratulations to all the people of Akola and the district administration and the citizens of the city who have made this work a people-to-people and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
Dear countrymen, you must have heard about the Padma Puraskars during these days.
There will be news on newspapers and TV.
It is routine to give Padma Awards every year, but it has been known for the last three years.
Any citizen of this country can manage.
Because all the procedures have been made through the online, it has an efficiency.
In a way, the election process for these awards has changed completely.
Generally, in cities, newspapers and TVs, the Padma Puraskars will be given to those who are not seen in the conferences.
Shri Aravind Gupta will be awarded Kit Ke.

He has been making toys for the past four decades to increase the scientific engagement in the Kushis.
He is trying to inspire them to carry out scientific experiments with unused leaflets.
For this, inspire Kai Ku's films made in 18 languages in 30 schools across the country.
Strange life and dedicate it to marvel.
One such story is that of Sitawa Jodhi in Karnataka.
Don't tell the goddess of women's power.
For the last three decades, he has played an important role in transforming the lives of the number of women in Balgaon.
He dedicated himself to the goddess when he was seventy years old and will dedicate his life only for the betterment of the goddesses.
Not only that, it's done the unprecedented work for women's good.
Because of this interest, not only in India but in the whole world.
His pictures are being displayed in countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He recognised the talent of Kirteku Majum Shyam for India overseas and gave him Padma Shri.
You will be surprised to know the story of the tribal lady Laxmiku of Kerala.
Laxmiku ji lives at Kallar and lives in a humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid humid hu
With the strength of your own memories, more than 5000 green trees have been built.
There is a special priority in the manufacturing of snakes.
Laxmi ji used to serve the society through his own knowledge of the greenery.
The country has been honored with Padma Shri to identify this personality and contribute to the society.
At the age of 23, her husband died without treatment, inspired to build a hospital for the poor.
Thousands of poor people are being treated freely in the hospital to be constructed through their hard work.
Sometimes in schools and colleges, they should be invited and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the architecture, some of the efforts of society have to be made.
Dear countrymen, every year we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas on 9th January.
On 9th January, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in South Africa.
Today, we celebrate an unwavering relationship with Indians living in India and the world.

The event was attended by members of Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Brien, Suriname, South Africa and America.

Our people of Indian origin live in different countries of Europe - some work associated with cyber security, some dedicated to Ayurveda, some poems, some poems and poems.
30th January is the remembrance of the renowned Bapu who had given us a new path.
Let us pay tributes to the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation at 11 o'clock.
They're not just concepts.
Dear Friends, I wish you all the good wishes of 2018 to end my words.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
This is the last day of Mann Ki Baat this year and today is the last day of 2017.
I shared a lot with you this year.
The year will change after a few hours, but the share of our ideas will continue.
On the occasion of Christmas, Jesus recalls the greatest lessons that we have given to Jesus Christ.
We see the whole of the sense of service in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramahansar used to say, "Live lives with a sense of pride.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji is inspiring for us.
In this attempt, he had to lose many things personally.
I am very fortunate to note that in the beginning of this year, I was able to attend the lunch festival organized by Guru Gobind Singh in Patna Sahib on the occasion of the 3rd eleventh birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
We can conclude with our hearts that learning lessons from the greatest teachings and inspirational life taught by Guru Gobind Singh.
1st January, 2018, that is tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say something special, I say it's really important.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the Republic of India and the voters of the Republic of New India.
This entire India encourages you to welcome the voters of the twentieth century.
You will be proud to be the voter of the twentieth century.
Your vote will be the basis for innovation.
The strength of the vote is the greatest strength in democracy.
Voting is one of the most powerful changes in the lives of millions of people.
You just don't have the right to vote.
You can be the creators of the twentieth century by thinking about how India should be in the twentieth century and how to dream of India in the twentieth century.
Young people of New India are the synonym of excitement, freshness and energy.
The dream of a New India is fulfilled through our energetic, efficient and powerful youth.
When we talk about a New India, it is a free India from casteism, casteism, terrorism and the poison of corruption.
India free from pollution and poverty.
Everyone gets equal opportunity and everybody's ideas are fulfilled.
New India is the strengths that lead us to peace, unity and harmony.
My youngsters should come forward and imagine how to form a New India.
How can we realize our imaginations before 2022
How can we create India like our freedom fighters dream
Mahatma Gandhi has transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, we need to organize a mass movement to create a magnificent and divine India of the twentieth century.
The birthplace of development, the birthplace of progress and the birthplace for a strong and powerful India.
Today, many opportunities have been opened for the youth.
From innovation to innovation and industry, our youngsters are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to assure the youngsters of this New India how to get the information about the projects that open such occasions and when they are 18 years old, they will get the knowledge of the world and the projects that will create a system to achieve it.
Nothing can be impossible for a person full of positive thinking and enthusiasm.
There is a saying in English, Pessimism Leads to Wikens, Optimism to Power.
The tweets and responses that came were really encouraging.
It was very comfortable.
Some people shared the events that have been positively influenced by their minds.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
My name is Fish Bhadiya.
I live in Mayor Vihar, Pocket 1, Face 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm speaking from a place called Bodel.
As per my husband's instructions, an insurance premium was supplied every month.
He died in the accident.
So we know what our situation is.
My name is happiness Jadhav.
The National Highway has been going through our different villages since 2017.
My name is Satish Bevani.
There was a shortage of water in our region and for the last 40 years we had been dependent on the pipelines of the soldiers.
Now put a pipeline...
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many such things in their own way to bring positive changes in the lives of the people.
This is the new India that we all build together.
On the other hand, I have been told about the inspirational story of Bashir Khan Khan Khatk, who is the leader of the Administrative Services from Kashmir.
He was in the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination to get rid of terrorism and despair.
You will be surprised to know that the terrorists had burnt his heritage in 1990.
His family had to leave their legacy and divert, where terrorism and violence were more.
He chose a different way for himself and served the people.
He saved himself from the opposite environment and saved the story of victory.
Today, he is not only in Jammu Kashmir but also inspired by the youth throughout the country.
Anju has also proven that the environment is so bad, but through positive steps, it is not despairing of despair.
Last week, I had the opportunity to see some girls from Jammu Kashmir.
It was excitement, excitement, energy, dream, determination.
I was inspired by the time I spent with those children.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to say about the Sabarimala Temple of Kerala while discussing not only my country but also the world's famous religious places.
In this world famous temple thousands of devotees come every year to receive the blessings of Lord Ayyappasamy .
How many devotee come, how big can it be to look at such an important place without waste
If there are mountains and jungles, do you specially say
A police officer named Vijayan started a program called Purniam Pungavan, which has started a self-reliance movement of awareness about waste management.
Any devotee has made a habit that the journey will not be completed without any physical effort in the matter of cleanliness.
There's no bigger in this movement, no smaller.
Every devotee is a part of God's worship and keeps away for a while, works, works to remove the dirt.
Every morning, it is very surprising that the scene of garbage is removed and all the pilgrims participate in it.
Whether it is a big celebrity or a rich man, everybody participates in the programme like a common devotee and goes ahead after purification.
There are many such examples before us.
The sacred pilgrimage in Shabarimala is part of the pilgrimage of all the devotees.
The determination to cleanse with severe wounds is progressing together.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we took a pledge to celebrate Bapujis birth anniversary of Swachh Bharat and Swachh Bharat.
Bapuji taught for this whole life, tried.
There has been a widespread change in rural areas and urban areas with the cooperation of the people.
The worlds largest Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted between 4th January and 10th March to assess the achievements made in the quality of cleanliness in the urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than 400 cities among about 40 crore people.
Talking to the citizens, he knows their response.
It will also discuss the use of Swachhata App and innovation of various services centres.
It will be tested whether all the systems of cleanliness in the city have been created in the city to become the habit of the people and to change the nature of the city.
Don't let the government clean up.
All citizens and citizen organisations have great responsibility.
I would like to appeal to all the people to participate in the Swachhta Survekshan in the coming days.
Try not to retreat your city, your street and your village.
On the basis of this survey, the ringing of cities will be done - if your city is more than a million people, if there is a small population in the country's ringing, it is your dream that if there is a small number of people in the country then it will be your dream to achieve the highest place in the local  ranking.
Come, let us once again recall Bapus vision and use the best examples of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, some things look very small, but as a society, there is a far-reaching impact on our personality.
Today, in this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share something like this with you.
For decades, Muslim women were injustice, but nobody discussed it.
There is no such law in many Islamic countries.
But the Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without men.
I have been advised by the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all women approving to go alone are allowed to go to Haj.
I urge the women who are requesting to go alone to get rid of this humiliation. I want to give them the opportunity to consider them in a particular way.
India's development journey has progressed on the basis of their talent in the strength of our women's strength.
I am confident that our women and men will have equal rights and I want to get equal opportunities, and our continuous efforts should be made to move together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day for us.
But it will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
This year, leaders from 10 ASEAN countries will come to India as the chiefs of the Republic Day celebrations.
This time it's not a Republic Day, it's 10 chief guests.
This has never happened in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and in 2017, India's Alliance with ASEAN completed 25 years.
It is a matter of great pride for all Indians to join hands with these great leaders from 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and in a way our country is the country of festivals.
It's not even a day that doesn't belong to the festival.
We've just celebrated Christmas, the new year is about to come here.
May the new year bring you happiness, happiness and prosperity.
Let us move ahead with a new zeal, new enthusiasm, happiness and a new vision.
The sun is moving towards Uttarayan in January, and this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated.
This is a celebration of nature.
In Rajasthan, it will be called Sankrant, Magh-Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu and all festivals are unique in its own style and they have their own importance.
The festival is celebrated between 13th January and 17th January.
The names of all these festivals are different but the basic elements are the same.
Many congratulations to the new year 2018.
Thank you very much, my dear people.
Mann Ki Baat, September, 2019
At the age, they are greater than us, and they are witnesses to each step and every era of the country.
Before leaving for foreign travel, I got the opportunity to talk to Deepi on the phone.
It was a lovely conversation like a brother speaking to his sister with great love.
I don't usually tell you about personal conversations like this.
Modiji-Latadidi, Pranama.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
On Modiji-Deedi's birthday, many good wishes are present.
May the health of Deepi be well-beinged and pray that the blessings of Deepi be upon us all.
Before going to America, I was calling for a reception to Deepi.
It was a pleasure to hear Netaji-Modiji's phone call.
Will you go back to me
Everyone at home...
Lataji - I think that with the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners.
You don't know what you are.
As soon as you come, I know that India's picture is changing.
Modiji - Yes.
Mother is happy with this love of Modiji-Deedi.
I am extremely grateful to Modiji-Deedi for remembering me.
Once again, I celebrate birthdays.
Modi ji, when he came to Mumbai this time, it was good to see him.
Modi ji, but I'll be late.
Modiji, come home and eat some Gujarati food from the hands of Deepadi.
Lataji, of course.
I'll be lucky.
Modiji - Pranama Deepi.
Lata ji-Promise.
My best wishes to Modiji-Deedi, Lataji-Namaste Namaste.
Modiji-Namaste.
My dear countrymen, from today to today, the time of festivals has come once again with new enthusiasm, new energy and new zeal and new determinations.
Now for weeks, the glimpse of festivals will be filled throughout the country.
Everyone in the family will be together in the festivals.
That's why it's called the darkness under the fire.
Perhaps this word contains only words, we have an order, a vision, an inspiration.
Just imagine that while some houses are lighted on one side, on the other side, darkness is covered in some nearby roofs.
The real pleasure of these festivals is that when this darkness is lost, the light is spreading.
They're looking for the people from their homes and finding their dresses, sweets and food and bringing them.
This time, can you try to darken the bottom of the bottom of the galaxy with awakening and determination in this season of festivals
The laughing of many poor families will double your happiness in festivals, your face will be shiny, your lamp will be shiny, your lamp will be shiny.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this time
In our culture, daughters are believed to be Lakshmi because women bring goodwill and prosperity.
Many daughters will be amongst us, dedicated to their own self-dedication and intellectual wealth, the name of the family and the society and the nation.
Can you organise the programme of honoring these Lakshmis of India on the occasion of Diwali
We have many daughters and daughters doing extraordinary things.
Our society should recognize such women and respect them and proudly proud of them.
All of us together have organized a massive gathering called 'Selfie with Daughter', as we have published all over the world.
Similarly, this time we can organize the birthplace of Bharat Ki Lakshmi.
In order to promote India's Lakshmi, it is to strengthen the path of prosperity between the people and the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, I have already said that I am fortunate to directly interact with many people who do not know and know through the Mann Ki Baat program.
Alina Thyang, a student from Arunachal, far away last day, sent me a very funny letter.
My country is Roe-Ing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my results came, people asked me whether I read the book Exam Warriors.
After that my experience was very good.
If I had read that book before exams, I'd be nice.
And this little friend has given me a job.
But I have an appeal to you to help me.
I must read all this.
I think of it and I think it's okay in my words, I'll try to write it in my own way.
I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to this young friend of Arunachal, student Alina Thyang.
Look.
This time, as it was discussed in the US Opinion on victory, Runner up Daniel Madwedev's speech was also discussed and social media was well-known.
I also shook the speech and played.
Madwedev's sympathy and his glory were all attracted at Dan, 23.
Of course, it attracted me too.
Just a short while before this speech, he failed 19 times with Grand Slam Jetta and the Historian of Tenness, Rafael Natal.
Had anyone else been on this occasion, they would have become sad and disappointed.
His words were welcomed by the audience, Harsharao.
He also praised Dan Champion Nadal and said how Naddal inspired millions of young people to play tennis and how difficult it was to play with him.
The zeal and glory of the man who failed in one game was worth seeing.
If you don't listen to Medveda's words in Dan, you must see that video, especially to the youth.
Of this, people from all spheres and all ages have to learn, and it's a great moment for the kingdoms.
The kingdoms are not big.
Life's a victory.
It has been very beautiful in our country's sciences.
The thoughts of our ancestors are certainly congratulating.
It has been said in the scriptures that if Vidya Vinaya Upayer Haratina Chetanasi Kasya Manujasyamani Kanchenjunga Sangayayog is a worldwide translation, whose heart cannot succeed if it is accompanied by talent and dignity in a person.
This young sportsperson actually conquered the hearts of people around the world.
My dear countrymen, especially Young Friends, I am going to say this thing directly for your good.
There will be debates, but there will be opposite parties, but it will be very beneficial if some things are stopped before they grow up.
When it grows very large, it is very difficult to stop some things.
But in the beginning, if we stop it very carefully, we can save many.
The habit of not smoking is due to nicotine.
By eating it in childhood only affects the growth of brain .
But today I want to tell you something new.
You might be aware that e-cigarettes were banned recently in India.
E-cigarettes are different from normal cigarettes.
In e-cigarettes, a kind of chemical smoke is formed when the nicotine fluid is hot.
Like other cigarettes , in order to avoid smelling from it smelling chemicals are included in it .
Even if the father's chicken smoker is at home, he's trying to stop others from smoking, and wants children not to smoke cigarettes and beeds.
He wants to not smoke a cigarette at home.
He knows that smoking and smoking are very harmful to the body.
But the e-cigarette is completely different.
People don't know about the e-cigarette.
It's very unaware of the danger, so sometimes e-cigarettes get home as curious.
You know if someone smokes near us, we can smell it.
He's got cigarette packets in his pocket, but it's smelling.
But this is not the case of e-cigarettes, so many children and young people are seen walking in their books, offices, pockets and sometimes they are becoming victims of this.
Youth floor is the future of the country.
This new method of drug addiction has prevented the e-cigarettes from spreading roots in the society to avoid destruction of our youth, not to change the dreams of the family, not to destroy the lives of children.
I appeal to everyone not to quit the habit of smoking and misunderstanding e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India, right
It doesn't mean that if we go to Gym for two hours in the morning and evening, it doesn't mean fit India.
Stay away from it for Fit India.
Our Bharatamba, our country is a magnificent country.
Several human beings have grown on this planet.
The year of India was the birthplace of uncommon people, the land of Karma.
They are dedicated to others, not for themselves.
And such a magnificence is being honoured in the city of Vatican on 13th October.
It is a matter of great pride for all Indians and Pope Francis will declare Maryam Treasy as sacred on 13th October.
Sister Maryam Treasury is an example of the work done for the betterment of mankind in their narrow life of 50 years.
My dear countrymen, when we celebrate Gandhi 150, we are proud of the fact that only 130 crore people have taken a pledge to get rid of the plastic used once.
India has shown an advance in front of the world in terms of environmental protection, so the entire world looks closer to India.
I am confident that you all will be part of the gathering to avoid single use plastic on 2nd October.
At each place, people share their share in their own ways in this third.
But a young man in our country has made a different move.
When I turned my attention towards this work, I tried to call him and understand his new way.
He said that it can be beneficial for the country and the people.
Shri.
When I heard the word Plogging first, it was a new word.
Perhaps this word can be used a little overseas.
However, Riputman Dalvi in India gave a big propaganda to this.
Come on, let's talk to him.
Our India will move 130 crore steps in terms of liberation from the Eko-use Plastics once it is used by 130 crore people.
Ripudaman ji, thank you once more.
Many congratulations to your team and this new idea.
I'd like to remind you of something.
However, it is time for some people to start training and plan for some programmes.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August, 2022, you will visit 15 places of India.
Make a plan to stay at least one night or two nights at least 15 places.
You see India, understand, feel.
My dear countrymen, once again, I congratulate you all for the various festivals of India with diversity.
Yes.
On the occasion of Deepawali, you should also keep in mind that the people are buried and burnt and not dangerous.
Aware of that.
With enthusiasm, we can celebrate new dreams and new visions.
My best wishes once more.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Namaskar to my dear countrymen.
Just a few years ago, I got the opportunity to interact directly with the children from Karnataka.
He called upon the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of India in a programme organised by the Times Group 'Vijay Karnataka' on a childhood day.
And they published the selected letters.
I was very happy to read the letters.
These young children also know the problems of the country.
They also know about the country's discussions.
Kirti Hegde from North Kannada... Congratulating the Digital India and Smart City programs, the child says that we need to change our education system.
If we don't give children the information about nature, then perhaps it will be very beneficial in the future to save the environment.
Reda Nadaf, a child from Laxmeshwar, says she is proud of being the daughter of a soldier.
Any Indian who is not proud of our soldiers.
And it's very natural to be proud if the army's daughter is too.
Irfan Begum from Calcutta writes that the school is 5 km away from the house, so it has to get out of the house early and it's too late to return home.
That's why they say they can't spend time with friends.
But I liked the papers that they wanted to reach me, so I could read those letters.
It's a good experience for me.
Dear people, it's 2611 today.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1949, the Constitution of India accepted the same day.
On 26th January, 1950, the Constitution came into existence, so we celebrate that day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constitutional Working Committee.
They used to build the Constitution of India for nearly three years.
Those who read about this discussion will be proud of what their thoughts were dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they worked to create a constitution of our country with diversity
When the country gets rid of the slave's clutches, they have expressed their viability and long-term perspective.
It's not an area of unexpected life, it's not a matter of nature.
Equality and compassion for everyone is the face of our Constitution.
It is our duty to adhere to the Constitution in letters.
Whether it is a citizen or a ruler, we have to move ahead with the spirit of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should be harmed.
17 different committees have been constituted based on important issues in this Constitutional Construction Church.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the President of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He played an important role.
On 6th December, we recall and bow down regularly on the day of his birth anniversary.
Baba Saheb's contribution to making the country rich and strong is unforgettable.
15th December is the sacred day of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel turned the country into a cruel man from the fertilizer son and made a very extraordinary commitment to corresponding to a corresponding country.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Infrastructure Council.
The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has chaired the Consultative Committees for Infrastructure, Multilateral Rights, Minority and Tribal Welfare.
Remembering the brave citizens, the police, the security personnel and all others who lost their lives and bowing down to them.
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
Today, terrorism is taking a very terrible shape in every part of the world, in a way.
We have been suffering from terrorism for the last 40 years in India.
Our thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism is challenging humanism.
This is the land that Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi gave a message to the world of immunity and love.
Terrorism and Terrorism make our socio-economic ties weak and deteriorate.
Therefore, it is time to be more aware of human powers.
My dear countrymen, we all celebrate the Naval Sensation Day in December, Naviday.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of rivers.
This country has an incredible connection to our planet and the oceans.
If we look at the history, the Chola Navik Sena was considered the most powerful navigator in the past 800-900 years ago.
In the development of the Cholasamrajya, their naval forces played a very important role in enhancing the financial strength of the time.
Several examples of the movements of Chola Navy and the search journeys can be seen in a collective manner.
Some people know that most of the world's naval forces have allowed women in warships too late.
However, in the Chola Navy, it was also 800-900 years ago, many women had played a very important role.
Women were also involved in the war.
The Chola rulers knew very well about shipbuilding.
When we talk about the Navy, anyone can forget the ability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his ability to build a boat.
The Konkan coast was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhu Durg, Murud Jamjira and Gold Fort connected with Shivaji Maharaj were either on the sea or on the sea.
The Maratha Navy was waiting for the safety of these forts.
There were big ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
Their naval forces were very capable of attacking any enemy and protecting the country from the enemy.
How do we not remember Kanhoji Angre when we remember the Maratha Navy
He brought the Maratha Naval Force to a new height, and built the Maratha Naval Army camps at several places.
After Independence, our Indian Navy showed its insurgency at various stages, in Goa's releasing campaign, in the 1971 India-Pakistan war.
When we talk of the Shipping Force, the war is inspiring, but the Indian Navy has come forward with great enthusiasm in humanitarian matters.
Soon, the ship named Sumitra helped rescue people and handed over many fisheries safely from the sea to Bangladesh.
This year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka in May-June, three ships of our Navy arrived there and helped the government and the people there.
On 21st November, when a trade union was held in West Golf, INS reached Tricolor for assistance.
Whether it is to provide healthcare to Fuji, whether it is to provide immediate rescue assistance, or to provide humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country, our Navy has done a proud act, and we Indians are always proud of our security forces and respectful to them.
Whether it is the army or the Navy or the Air Force... every Indian bows down to the courage, bravery, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live peacefully and comfortably for hundred and twenty five crore people.
Every year on 7th December, the Crown Flag Day is celebrated.
This is the day to be proud of the soldiers of the country and to express their pride.
I am happy that this time, the Ministry of Defence has decided to organize a programme from 1st December to 7th December, and will come to the citizens of the country to make people aware about the civilians and to make people aware.
Every week, children and adults should wear the flag.
There should be an advance of respect for the army in the country.
You can call the soldiers in schools and colleges and get information about the army from them.
We can change this by making our new generation a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This opportunity is to provide wealth for the betterment of all the soldiers of our armed forces.
These funds are used to rehabilitate the families of the soldiers who have been martyred in the war as a military welfare borrower for the help of the wounded soldiers.
We can also contribute ourselves to their good.
I want to say something to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the Earth.
What we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to the soil.
Think of what happens if there is no soil in this world.
I'm afraid of thinking.
We have already thought about this in our culture, so we have been aware of the importance of the soil since ancient times.
On the one hand, there is a natural effort to contribute to the soil, the soil, the devotion and thanks to our culture, on the other hand, scientific projects were part of life to keep the soil nutritious.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to the soil and to protect the soil in a scientific manner.
We are proud that the farmers of our country are associated with the tradition, and are interested in modern science, and efforts are made to take concrete decisions.
I heard about the farmers of Tehu village of Borund Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The harvest decreased and the revenues also decreased and the soil production capacity slowly decreased.
Some farmers of the village have understood the seriousness of this situation and have given advice on how many chemicals, other cattle, micro-nutrients and biodiversity by checking their soil at the right time.
You will be surprised to know what was the result of the advice that you should know about the health of the soil.
And the quality of the soil increased.
If you want to think about the crops, then you will have to worry about the maternal grandmother first and if you are ready to meet the maternal grandmother, the farmers will see us as well.
Over 10 crore soil health cards have been constructed by our farmers across the country to enlighten the soil.
We have faith in Mother Earth, but have we thought of how harmful the Bhoommata's health by using chemicals like urea
It has been proved in every kind of scientific way that the use of more than necessary urea causes serious damage to the motherland.
Can our farmers make a decision to use half of the urea used today in the farming sector during 75 years of independence in 2022
We have started feeling the world's heat and climate change.
There was a time when it was cold before Diwali.
Now the beginning of December, the cold is slowly moving.
The 8-year-old unspeakable child, made Visil his weapon.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, he went to the village houses and woke up and taught people not to urinate in the open space.
The kumhari village became free from external defecation because of this boy who had gone to 30-40 houses every day to learn about cleanliness.
The young boy Tushar has done an inspirational thing to promote cleanliness.
Our divine brothers and sisters are determined, capable and brave.
We get to learn something.
Today they work well in all fields.
Whether it is in the field of Sports or in any competition or any social reform, our divine people are not behind anyone.
You will remember that our divine sportspersons had achieved 4 medals by performing well in Rio Olympics and the blind peoples T20 cricket worldwide.
Various competitions are being held across the country.
The seventeenth National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur last day.
Our young divine brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and showcased their efficiency.
One of them is Gegger Tucker from Gujarat, and 80 percent of his body does not have muscles.
He was elected to the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics as a result of his talent.
He is one of the 32 Para Swimmers who are trained at the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar.
My salute to Gegger Tucker... my best wishes to him.
Today, Divyangar can reach any area and there is a special focus on opportunities.
It is our endeavor to be capable of all the people of the country and to create a society that includes everyone.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
This is the day the prophet Hazarat Mohammad Saheb was born.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen.
This suggestion is very good, but I feel like adding and changing something to this suggestion.
The elders in our village will always say.
Forget the sadness, don't forget the joy.
Can't you make your contribution in this
Come, let's share good wishes in the POSITEVENDIA (HASTAG POSITEVENTION INDIA) in the NRendramodi App, MiGOV or social media.
Remember the events that inspire others.
Remembering good things, there will be a feeling of doing good.
It's energy to do good things.
Let us share the strength and consequences of this combined unity.
There's a chance to tell you a lot.
PM 29th October, 2017
The sun and the water are important in Chhath Puja, but the utensils and cattle made of bamboo and soil are essential to worship it.
The message of worshipping sunrise and sunset in this festival of faith is full of unparalleled culture.
The world will be worshipped and honored for the upliftment.
But the Chhota Pooja Astham gives us a message of surety to worship.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also linked to this festival.
The entire household is cleaned at Chhatti and people share with great enthusiasm in rivers, lakes and ponds, shores, shores, i. e.
Suraj Vandana or Chhath Puja is a celebration of environmental protection, disease prevention and inclusion.
It is natural for anyone to be proud of this great heritage of India.
You might have been happy to hear that such a business took place in a store of Khadi and Handloom.
During Deepawali, the sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation has increased by about 680.
The total sale of Khadi and handicrafts has increased by about 90 percent this year compared to last year.
Today, it shows that young people, women, people of every age like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how many families and poor families have benefited from this.
He says we should remember our brave security forces.
We also want to get home sweets to the soldiers.
I once again got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with the brave security personnel on the border.
This time I celebrated Deepawali with the security personnel at the Greece Centre in Jammu Kashmir.
Our security guards respect all the soldiers of our security forces for fighting, dedication, sacrifice and sacrifice for every countrymen, because of the hard and tragic situation in the border.
If we get the opportunity, we have to listen to their proud stories to know the experiences of our young people.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our security forces have played a vital role not only in our borders but also in establishing peace across the world.
They are enhancing the synergy of Hindustan across the globe.
On 24th October last day, the UN Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone recalls the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in the world and their active role.
We consider Vasudhaiva family, that is, the whole world is our family.
Due to this belief, India has been actively participating in the various important initiatives of the United Nations since the beginning.
India has always given importance to women and the human rights declaration of the United Nations is a living example of this.
It was suggested in the initial sequence that all men were born free and equivalent, and the Indian representative Hamsa Mehta's endeavour was accepted by the fact that all human beings were born free and equal.
Looks like it doesn't seem very sure, but it looks like a healthy thinking.
The biggest contribution made by India under the United Nations is the peacekeeping mission of the United Nations.
India has always played an active role in the peacekeeping missions of the United Nations.
Some of you know this is the first time.
More than 16000 Indian security personnel have served in the peacekeeping missions of the United Nations.
Now nearly seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with the peace process of the United Nations and India is the third largest in the world.
By August 27, Indian soldiers have served nearly 50 missions in 71 peacekeeping destinations across the world.
These missions were in various parts of the world including Korea, Cambodia, Lavos, Vietnam, Kong, Cyprus, Liberia, Liberia, Labban and Sudan.
In congo and southern Sudan, more than 20,000 patients were treated in the Indian Army hospitals and rescued the number of people.
The security forces of India saved not only the people of different countries but also conquered their minds through mass devotion.
Indian women have also played an important role in establishing peace.
People don't know that India is the first country to send a woman police team to the United Nations Peace Mission in Libya.
This move of India is inspiring to the nations around the world.
After that, all the countries started sending their women police teams.
You will be surprised to hear that India's contribution is not only in peace, but it is also a training for the peacekeeping force in nearly 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this soil have conveyed the message of peace and harmony across the globe.
Peace mission actions are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work astray in remote areas.
You have to live between different people.
We need to know and understand different situations and different cultures.
We have to change ourselves according to the local needs and environment.
Today, when we remember our brave United Nations peacekeepers, who would forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria
Remembering him, all Indians will be proud of him.
At the age of 1989, he became Operation Force Commander of Namibia and served the freedom struggle of that country.
General Timya, the head of the Indian Army, guided the United Nations peacekeeping system in Cyprus.
India has always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony throughout the world as peaceful.
It is our belief that everybody should live with peace and harmony and move forward as a creation of a good and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage was brilliant with the great saints who served humanity freely.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagini Nivedita, was one of those extraordinary people.
Margaret Elizabeth lived in the Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave her the name Nivedi.
The word "Nivedita" was completely dedicated.
Afterwards, they dedicated themselves to the name and empowered the name.
Yesterday was Sister Nivedita's 100th birthday.
They are ready to dedicate their lives to the service of the poor through the influence of Swami Vivekananda.
In the transgressions of British rule, Sister Nivedita's mind was hurt.
The British not only slaughtered our country, but they tried to make us mentally slaves.
They continued to strive hard to create a sense of despair in our country by showing our culture.
Bhagini Naidu reiterated the pride of Indian culture.
The renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati's daughter-in-law is known as women empowerment.
It's called Bhagini negative.
Bhagini Naidu was collaborating with the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose.
They helped the research of boss through articles and conferences.
Indias unique beauty is spirituality and science in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Jagadish Chandra Bose are the strongest examples of this.
Hundreds of people died when a terrible plague spread over Calcutta in 1899.
Sister Nivedita did not take care of her own health and started cleaning work on tracts and roads.
Sister Nivedita, a woman who went out to serve the poor while she lived a happy life.
With their inspiration from this sacrifice, people came forward to collaborate in service.
Thank you for your phone call.
Many felicitations to all children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the greatest heroes in the creation of a New India, dogs.
It is a matter of great concern that the disease that had already been accomplished to the elderly and the disease that has been afflicted with the evenings of life has already started to appear in children.
It's surprising that children are also suffering from diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are called lifestyle disorders.
The main reason for the occurrence of such diseases is the deficiency of physical activity in lifestyle and changes in food habits .
Societies and families have to pay attention to this.
If you think about it, you don't have to do anything special.
It is only necessary to make small things properly, make them habits and make them their own nature.
Children climb up and down in the lift instead of climbing down and climbing the stairs.
After dinner, try to walk a little by taking the entire family of children.
Yoga for Young India, Yoga for Young India.
Because I'm habitually telling you that any person of age can make it easier.
It's simple because the inadequacy is learning, and it's possible to do somewhere else.
It doesn't need equipment or field.
There are many studies that how much Yoga is doing in controlling diabetes .
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives, not as a medium of treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have received good news in the past from the games.
Our sportspersons have won the country in different games.
In Hockey, India won the Asia Cup Hockey crown through a good game.
Our players played a good game, so India could become Asia Cup Champions after 10 years.
Earlier, India had achieved Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the entire team for the support staff that helped them.
After Hockey, India also listened to good news in Batminton.
Batminton Star Kidambi Srikanth won the Open Crown for Denmark and proudly congratulated the Indians.
After Indonesia Open and Australian Open, Super Serius Premier Crown.
I extend my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and the proudness of India.
Friends, FIFA and 17 World Cup competitions were held this month.
The teams from all over the world brought their glory to India and showcased their glory in the football field.
I also had a chance to go to see a game.
The sportspersons and the audience were very excited.
World Cup competitions were successfully conducted and all teams showcased their best games.
Young sportspersons of India have embraced the hearts of everyone, even if they cannot get the crown of India.
The whole world, including India, enjoyed the Festival of Sports, and the tournament was very attractive and funny for Football lovers.
The future of Football has started to show.
I once again congratulate all the sportspersons, all those who have worked with them and all the best wishes.
Some people send photographs of small kids in this regard, some will be the story of young people's collective efforts.
There, a team of government organizations called Ecological Protector Organization (Ecosystem Rescue Organization) went out to clean the Chandrapur Fort.
In this two hundred days-long work, people continued to clean up a group in the fort as an activity without any tiredness.
I am surprising to see the picture, I would like to listen to the despaired and despaired organisation's youth, their sweat, their enthusiasm and determination in those vibrant pictures.
Your disappointment will turn into trust.
This sacred effort towards cleanliness is a marvellous example of beauty and enormousness.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
By eating food together, people became emotional about unity and equality.
Guru Nanak Dev ji delivered three messages to the real life - the name of the soul, the name of the soul, the name of the soul and the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev created a guru to tell him.
In the coming year, we will be celebrating the 550th birthday of Guru Nanak Dev.
Come, let us move through the path of his message and his teachings.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October after two days.
We all know that he's underweared the modern Akhand India.
We can learn a lot by traveling through the extraordinary life of that great son of Bharatamba.
His expertise was in bringing thoughts into action.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the destination of the task of embracing India in a maze.
He assured millions of Indians to be brought under the guise of a nation, a constitution.
He empowered him to take a firm decision to overcome all the obstacles.
He determined a goal, progressed firmly towards that goal.
He could have done this work to unite the country.
Everyone was an equal country in his imagination.
I would like to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has spoken and that we are always inspiring.
These words of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and inspiring to visit our New India.
That is why his birthday is celebrated as National Integration Day.
I would like to appeal to you all that you should also participate in this festival of mutual understanding of the Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after Deepawali's vacation, with a new imagination and a new determination, you all will resurrect everyday life.
My best wishes to the people of the country to fulfill their dreams.
Three years have been completed after the programme Mann Ki Baat was started by the sky.
Today is the third sixth episode.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, the people who have sent their minds from all corners of the country can only say, but I get a rich food.
It's more inspiring to me.
Some of the things are about reforms in government matters.
Sometimes there may be personal complaints and sometimes it attracts attention to social problems.
When Mann Ki Baat, I remember one thing that Acharya Vinoba Bhave said.
Today, after three years, I am sure that socio-scientists, universities, researchers and media specialists will imagine this.
I am confident that this discussion will be more beneficial than Mann Ki Baat in the future.
Mann Ki Baat said that we should take only as much as we can eat and don't waste.
But letters came from every corner of the country, from social organisations, from the youth.
After that, how many people came forward to do such things for cleanliness.
Since then, not only in India but also in the world, the Selfie with Doctors programme has become a big campaign.
This is not just a matter of social media.
Every girl has a new self-confidence and a new pride.
All parents began to take selfie with their own daughter.
Every girl started feeling that it's important, it's important.
Last day I was discussing with the Central Tourism Department...
I told those who went out of the tourism that I had to send photographs from wherever I went.
Millions of photographs and pictures of all the corners of India have been found in a way that is a huge wealth for those working in the tourism sector.
I am convinced of Mann Ki Baat that the smallest incident is creating a massive birthplace.
It was three years since the last three years that the events appeared in a glimpse.
The country is moving forward on the right path.
It's a big capital for any country, it's a big power.
I bow to the people with my heart.
Once I spoke of Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi is not a dress but an ideal.
The swords, the swords, the swords, the swords, the swords... the young people seem to have enhanced the interests of Toil Khadi.
Khadi's sales have increased, so poor people's houses are directly connected to employment.
From 2nd October, Khadiq Rebate is being given, and a lot of money is available.
This will strengthen the poor in our country and we have to do it.
Due to this increase in the interests of Khadi, people working in the Khadi sector have been encouraged to think in a new way in the towel for those connected with Khadi in the government.
How to bring new technology, how to improve productivity, how to bring solar-cattery
The ancient legacy has been destroyed for 20, 25, 30 years... to think of how to revive it.
We've been involved in a variety of activities.
Many people have got job opportunities.
The Khadi Village Industries Division in Pampore, Kashmir has revived its training team that has been locked up and Kashmir has a lot to contribute to this sector.
With the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will be helpful in creating new products and generating innovative ways.
Common people and others have started giving foodgrains to others.
We are directly aware of how a thing gets encouraged naturally.
My dear countrymen, we all decided in Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate the Cleanliness Festival throughout the country for 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
He said that cleanliness will connect with the people.
Our Hon'ble President has started this and the country has joined it.
Today, the elderly people, men and women, cities and villages have become part of the cleanliness duties.
I thank the Hon'ble President.
People from all sections of the country have considered it as theirs and all are associated with it.
Whether it is the Sports sector or the people of the film sector or the education sector, the schools, the colleges, the universities, the workers, the workers, the government servants, the police, the soldiers and the universities are associated with this.
There has been a change in the public places to prevent others from polluting public places, where workers have started feeling some pressure.
I am happy that in the first four days of Swachhta Hi Seva, more than 75 lakh people have joined me with more than 4000 initiatives.
This time we've seen one more thing, we're cleaning one place and others' attention to not being dirty...
But if cleanliness is to be a nature, it should be an emotional transformation.
This time, along with the Swachhta Hi Seva, fisheries were also conducted.
More than two and a half million children participated in the article on cleanliness.
Thousands of children have come in colorful pictures.
I don't forget to express my gratitude to the media persons when it comes to cleanliness.
They proceeded to this birthplace with great pride.
In their own way, they contributed immensely to creating a healthy environment.
A few days ago, somebody took my attention to the work of 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
Their brand ambassador has made BILL DAR clean, while talking about Brandy Ambassador, you will think he will be the hero in the Sports sector.
On seeing plastic, polythene, utilized bottles and other pulses, Bilal removes it and produces a small amount of income.
Bilalin Corps Ration gave a vehicle and uniform, he went to other areas and told people the lessons of cleanliness, inspired him to stand after him until the results were found.
Bilal Dar is younger than age, but he is inspired by everybody who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
Dear countrymen, we have to accept that the history of the future is born in the womb of today's history and when I talk of history, it is natural for me to remember the great men.
This October is the second month to remember many great men.
In the month of October, from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, those who have suffered a lot of hardships for the country, who have led us, led us to the path of pathways for twenty-two and twelve centuries.
This is also a centenary year of Nanaji and Dindal ji.
What was the center of all these great men
There was a common thing - living for the country, doing something for the country...
Gandhiji, Jayaprakash ji and Din Dayal ji were not only miles away from the territory of power, but immensely lived with life and worked for them.
Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Mahatma Gandhi used to tell the man who stood at the end of the society.
Sardar Sab unified the country.
We have to move ahead with unity.
Understand the diversity of this India, touch it and smell it.
You will see that these varieties of our country will work as a big lesson for the development of your personality.
The days of the holiday, the days of Diwali... we have the habit of traveling anywhere in the country.
Tourist travel is natural.
But we don't see our country, we don't know the varieties of the country, we don't understand, but it is a matter of concern that it has become liked to travel abroad in the wake of the impact of censorship.
The people of western India don't know what is in India.
How much diversity is our country
It should be noted that when Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalanji had visited India, they had a new inspiration to see and understand India and die for them.
All these great men traveled across the weight.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
Efforts were made to emulate India.
Can we try to integrate our different states, different communities, people, their lifestyles, their traditions, their dresses and their food habits to learn their understandings as a student
The value addition of tourism is not just because we see it, but because we understand it as a student and try to be part of it.
In my own experience, I must have got the opportunity to go to more than 500 districts of the country.
I've got a chance to stay in more than 450 districts...
Today, when I am responsible for this in India, the experiences of those journeys are very beneficial to me.
I get comfort to understand things.
I appeal to you that you have not experienced the unity of this vast India as a mirror, but as a treasure of our immense strength.
There is a dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of foods are there
If you eat it every day, you will never have to repeat it.
This is the greatest strength of our tourism sector.
Not only do you want to go out of the house during this holiday, you don't want to go out for a change, go with something to know and understand.
Include India and incorporate the diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be more prosperous through these experiences.
The limits of your thinking will be widened.
Who is the greatest guru than the experience
Generally, the time from October to March is travel time.
People are traveling.
I am confident that if you go this time, you will take my adventure forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share pictures.
Send photos on the subject of Hashtag incredible India.
If you can interact with the people at the place where you go, send photos of it.
Not only the buildings, but also the pictures of natural beauty, the life of the people there.
Write a good article about the journey.
Send it to Mai Govi, send it to the NarendraModi App.
I am happy to know about the seven places or seven things that every Indian knows about the best seven tourist destinations in your state.
If you can, you have to go to those seven places.
Can you give some information about it
Build films about such good places, create videos and encourage them to create catalytics - the government will accept the varieties you find.
You can also be inspired to promote tourism from the month of October to the month of March.
I invite you to it.
I'm deeply impressed.
I'm a man like you.
You might have noticed something that happened last day and people saw a divine example of women's power and patriotism.
The unusuality of this is that Swati and Nidhi's husbands are sacrificed by serving Bharat Mata.
Can we imagine what would be the feeling if it wasn't life at this young age
But the daughter-in-law Swati Mahadik of Baladi Kenal Anand Mahadik settled in the heart by looking at this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He learned well for 11 months and changed his life to realize his dream.
His wife's fund took a firm decision and joined the army.
It is natural for all people to be proud of these brave people.
I congratulate the two sisters.
They are inspiring millions of people of the country to become inspired by new inspiration and cheerfulness.
Many greetings to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our younger generation between Navratri Festival and Diwali.
FIFA Under-17 World Cup is going on in our country.
I'm sure the football will be all around.
Football will enhance the interest of all generations.
My dear countrymen, this is the new night.
It's time to worship Durgam Bai.
The atmosphere is full of sacred and sacred smell.
All around is the atmosphere of spirituality, festival and devotion.
It is believed to be the festival of power.
Within 75 years of Indias independence in 2022, we can move forward by creating a framework of five years to realise the dreams of freedom fighters, the determination, determination, square efforts and determination of hundred and twenty five crore people.
Thank you so much.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on August 27, 2017 at 11.
My dear countrymen, welcome to my best wishes.
On the one hand when the country drowns in festivals and on the other hand it is natural to have humiliation in the country by listening to the news of Himsa from any part of India .
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who has lived for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have accepted common values, ahimsa and mutual respect, which is part of our minds.
We've been saying Ahimsa Paramodharma since childhood.
In the name of faith, whether it is religion or political belief or the belief of traditions, I have said from the Red Fort that violence is not allowed.
There is a provision for justice for every person in the Constitution which Baba Saheb Ambedkar has given us.
Those who take the law, those who follow the path of violence, whether it is a person or a society, this country will never allow it, nor will any government allow it.
Everyone has to suppress the law.
The law will determine responsibility and punish the guilty.
Our country is full of diversity and this diversity is not just in food, in lifestyle, in dress and in dress.
We can see varieties on all the heads of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity.
Because of our cultural heritage for centuries, we can see that there will be no festival day in 365 days, even if we look at social traditions.
All our festivals can be seen that there is no festival associated with the time limitation of nature.
Everything is directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are connected to farmers and are directly associated with fisheries.
Today, when I talk about the festivals, I would like to tell you 'Michami Dukadam' first.
Yesterday, the festival 'Sanvatsari' was held in the Jain community.
In the Jain community, the festival of 'Tourism' is held in the month of Bhadra.
The last day of the festival 'Tourism' is the anniversary.
It's a surprising tradition.
The festival is a symbol of forgiveness, ahimsa and friendship.
This is called 'Khamavani' festival, and there is a tradition of greeting each other by calling it 'Michami Dukadam'.
In our scientific scientific scientifics, the pardon of forgiveness, the grace of valour.
Forgiveness is valourished.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, Forgiveness is the characteristic of a strong man.
Shekspeare, while inscribing the importance of forgiveness in Merchant of Venice, the play he wrote, Mercei is Tiwas Blessed, the Him Datt Givs, the Him Datt Takes, the forgiveness and the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time when Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated every corner of India.
Ganesh Chaturthi Festival is going on for ten days.
This festival is also a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
Many good wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganesh.
Now it's time for Honour in Kerala.
Onam, one of the colorful festivals of India, is the main festival of Kerala.
This is of social and cultural importance.
Online showcases the rich cultural ecosystem of Kerala.
In addition to the message of love and harmony in the society, this festival creates new enthusiasm, new ideals and new faith in the minds of the people.
Now this festival is becoming an incentive for thrilling journeys.
The Navratri Festival in Gujarat and the Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have also been seen to be an attractive tour in a way .
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners like this.
We need to think of what we can do about this.
A few days later, 'Idul Suha' will also be celebrated.
Besides the festivals being a symbol of devotion and belief, we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in a new India.
My dear countrymen, the ideas of becoming modern are changing.
Various experiments are conducted in every family.
Look how big it is, how joyful it is.
As I said, the country is full of intellectual awakening.
It's very happy to know about somebody's new invention.
Someone has said that an engineer has added some kind of soil and has taught him to make a Ganesh idol.
And when it burns that gem in a small bag of water, it melts quickly.
He didn't stop it.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Abhiyan was started and it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its benefits have started to be seen.
The toilets were 39 percent, which is now 67 percent.
More than two lakh 30 thousand villages have been declared free from external defecation.
Many people lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water came out, the dirt was spread everywhere.
We can create an environment of cleanliness across the country.
After the construction of the toilet, you can add your name to the portal and the name of the family that helped you.
In this, you can write articles in different languages, no age.
You can make short films on your own.
Let's make a two-three-minute long film that inspires cleanliness.
In any language, it might be silent.
Work yourself as part of it.
You will see how bright the Gandhi Jayanti day will be on 2nd October.
After the 15-day sewerage programme, after the Swachhta Hi Seva, on 2nd October, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, we can enjoy the glorious pleasure of paying homage to Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I wish you all the best to convey a special request to you.
I am waiting for your message as long as you wait for Mann Ki Baat.
I'm awaiting with quietness because I give you a chance to learn something.
There's a chance to change what I'm doing.
Your small things are beneficial for me to think with a new perspective.
"Primary, I am desperate from Pune.
I once went to Mall with her for shopping.
She spent two thousand rupees for a piece, spending Rs.450 for a piece.
But he asked the auto driver to go to the mall for five rupees.
Buying vegetables on the way back, the price saved 4-5 rupees.
I felt very bad.
Once in large numbers we pay the money without questioning about the price, but we urge the brothers and sisters who are dependent on us for a few rupees.
They're unbelievable.
You must tell us about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful to you for making a great message through this heartbreaking phone call.
I am sure that if my people also take this habit in the behavior of the poor then they will surely leave it.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the sports day will be celebrated throughout the country.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand, the great Hockey player, who showed Indrajalam in Hockey.
His contribution to Hockey was sustainable.
I am saying this because of the desire to connect our country with Youth Sports.
Sports should be part of our lives.
If we consider ourselves the youngest country in the world, then we should see our children in the games.
Sports is physical fitness, mental alertness and personality.
What is more needed.
Sports is an important medicine for the unity of minds in a way.
Young friends, Sports Ministry has prepared a Sports Town Circle Portal to identify and empower them.
Any child from all over the country, who has made any profits in the sports sector, can use video and apload if they want their own personal familiarity.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports will be trained by selecting the growing players.
Glad news is that the FIFA under 17 World Cups are going to be run in India from 6th to 18th October.
24 teams around the world are going to make India their home.
We are all inspired by the enthusiasm and passion of those six girls working in the Navy.
These six girls went out of the sea on a small boat called INS Tarini.
It's called Navika Sagar Vikrama.
They will return to India after months around the world.
These six children will travel daringly between the waves of the sea and this is the first time in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we celebrate the Teachers Day.
He was the President.
But he called himself a teacher.
He was a prince, a guide, a President of India, but in every sense he was an exciting teacher.
I bow down to him.
The great scientist, Albert Einstein, said that it is the best quality of a teacher in creative exhibition and learning, that is, creativity and knowledge among his students.
Can't we take a determination when we celebrate the Teacher's Day this time
Can you organize a movement like a mission
Teach to Transform, ducate to mpower, learn to emerge for ever change, learn to empower and guide.
Can we take this mission forward with a determination
Anyone who takes a determination for 5 years, guides to achieving it and enjoys the success of life in five years.
This will create an environment for our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk of transformation in our country, we will remember teachers in the society as we reflect mothers in the family.
Teachers have an important role in making changes.
There must have been an incident in the lives of every teacher who can make a change in the lives of somebody through a simple effort.
If we work together, we can play a big role in making changes in the country.
Let's move forward with a mantra to teach for transformation.
Prayer, Chief Minister.
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in Mumbai city and work for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in the financial analysis programme and social projects related to it.
After three years of this Jan Dhan Yojana, which began in 2014, I would like to ask you whether India is more secure and more robustly denouncing it.
The move was launched on 28 August 2014 as a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed for three years on 28th August.
Bank accounts opened by linking 30 crore new families with this.
It's more than the total population of many countries in the world.
Our poor people have invested about 60-50 thousand crore rupees in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana are giving birth to a new faith in the lives of those poor today with a dedicated premium of Rs.
When the poor was succumbed to the danger, some families got two lakh rupees within a few days due to insurance of one rupee.
Hundreds of examples have come to my fore about how a scheme makes a change in the lives of a person, how new energy is filled, how new faith is filled.
They can inspire the new generation by introducing such people.
My dear countrymen, I once again congratulate Michami Dukda.
Thank you so much.
It is the speciality of human minds that the rainy season attracts the heart.
As a result of the changing climate and the environment, there is a very adverse situation.
Over the past few days, people had to face disasters in some parts of India, especially in Assam, North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal.
The State Governments are doing their best to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens working with service morale make every effort to help people in this situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, the soldiers, the Air Force, the NDRF and the Armed Personnel Department are working with Life Payments to help flood victims.
Due to floods, life becomes very tired.
NDRF team.
The climate warnings are almost sufficient due to the development of technology and the progress made in the environment.
As per the climate schedule, if we decide the time frame of our actions is gradually a nature then we can be saved from major destructions.
When I was ready for Mann Ki Baat, I saw that the citizens of the country prepare it more than me.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountants Day.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched last month.
I am very happy to note that in the North-Eastern regions, in the remote mountainous regions, a person living in the jungles, I am afraid of the values and now I have started to understand things.
The time is reduced from one place to another, and the number of highways is low.
Due to the rapidity of trucks, pollution is decreasing.
Goods are fast reaching the targets.
The simplicity of this transformation has been transformed, how fast it has transformed from one way to another, new registrations have taken place, through which the entire country has become a new faith.
I am confident that sometimes economists, management experts and technologists will look into the implementation of GST in India as a model in the world.
A case study will be created for all the universities in the world.
Because such a huge change has led us to the summit of success that it has been successfully implemented in such a big country with the participation of millions of people.
The world must learn about it.
All states are involved in implementation of this GST, and all states are responsible.
All the decisions were taken by the States and the Central Government together.
The great dream of 'One Nation- One Tax' has been fulfilled.
I saw how the officers from the village to the centre worked with dedication and how beautiful atmosphere was created between the government and the traders, the government and the consumers and how much part of the GST was played in enhancing their faith.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the ministries, all the departments and all the officers of the Central-State Government.
GST is an excellent example of the success of the social power of India.
It's a history.
In a way, it is a movement of social reform.
I once again offer my best wishes to millions of Indians for the success of such a great effort.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
The country was free on August 15, 1947.
In the month of August, several events have been associated with the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the India Chhodo movement.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people joined the freedom struggle and tried hard work.
Histories are inspiring us to build a magnificent India.
The people of India are united against the British rule.
Millions of Indians were dedicated to fight life with a mantra called 'Practisation or Death' as per Mahatma Gandhis aspirations.
Millions of young people from across the country looked forward to studying their books.
They're descending after listening to the sound of freedom.
On 9th August, Mahatma Gandhi launched the invitation of Bharat Chhodo, but all the big leaders had been conquered by the British administration and at that time the country's second generation led by Dr.
The great men like Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan are the tribes.
Behind all this success was people, people's ability, people's determination, people's fighting.
The effort from 1857 to 1942 brought this war into its supremacy in 1942.
Within 5 years, in 1947, Britishers will have to leave India.
I want to connect you with the mathematics.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
About 70 years.
The governments have come.
Successes have come.
The hopes were awakened.
From 1942 to 1947, it was a decisive year to achieve a determination.
Five years have come to our forefront to achieve the goal from 2017 to 2022, and 15 August, 2017, we can be celebrating the occasion of our sight.
Let's have millions of determinations.
Try to achieve millions of determinations.
We have to take a determination.
2017 should be our dream year.
This August must be part of the determination.
Today, it is not necessary to work or die but to join the dream of a New India, to work with the mind and body to achieve success and to live with this dream.
Any decision that can be made in the next five years.
Social discussions can be organized for youth organisations, student organisations and government friendly organisations.
Let's bring new ideas forward.
Where do we go as a nation
What can be my contribution as a person
Through technology, come forward with video, post, blog, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a birthplace.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will inaugurate the uit India uitz for the youth.
This problem is an attempt to connect young people with the proud history of the country and introduce freedom fighters.
You must make a comprehensive propaganda and bring it to the people.
This time too, I invite you, surely tell your opinions on my govt app or Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to tell you about it as long as I get it on August 15.
I guess it's about 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, today I want to say something more.
There is a socio-economic system in India's economy.
We'll never sell it.
Our festivals and festivals are not just happy.
Our festivals and festivals are an attempt to social reform.
Individuals and society are connected together.
Thousands of jobs are linked to the festival, including rakhi makers, rakhi sellers and sellers of sweets.
This is why our dear brothers and sisters live.
We burn the lamps to Deepawali- it is not just a celebration of light, it is not just a celebration, but a celebration or adornment of houses.
It is directly related to the poor families that build soil rocks.
But today, when I talk about the festivals and the economic level of the poor people associated with them, I would like to say more about the environment.
I believe that people of this country are more aware and more active.
Awakening citizens have written letters to me about the environment for the last one month.
They called upon Ganesh Chaturthi to pursue the environment friendly Ganesh and make people feel like Ganesh in the soil.
I've been entrusting people with such awakening.
This time I'm saying this before.
I'm sure you'll be with me in this.
This will help its artisans and poor artists, and they will get jobs through the creation of idols.
The poor will fill their belly.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor, connect the poor with the financial financing of the poor and make the joy of our festival the economic fun of the poor.
I offer my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of the country for the various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, whether it is educational sector or economic sector in the country, whether it is social or sports sector, we are constantly watching the girls of our country bowing down to the country and raising their heights.
We are proud of our daughters.
Last day, our girls showed great performance in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
The pressure and constraints on their faces appeared.
I've evaluated things in another way.
I said, look, there is a lot of hope in this period of media.
Whether you win the game or not, you have won the hearts of hundred and twenty five crore people.
The youth base of the country, especially our girls, is actually doing a lot to enhance the synergy of our country.
I once again congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters, and my best wishes.
Dear Countrymen, I recall the August Revolution and recall the 9th August and recall the 15th August.
2022 recalls the seventeenth anniversary of independence.
Ensuring that all the countrymen are determined and all the people of the country prepare a 5-year programme for dreams.
We have to take the country to new heights.
Come on, let's go together, we've done something before.
Let us move forward with the belief that the future of the country will be bright.
The weather is changing.
The climate is comfortable due to heavy rains in many parts of the country.
The cold winds after the rains have been relieved from the heat in the past.
Whatever stir in life, however stressed in your life or in your normal life, the monsoon changes our mentality.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world, Lord Jagannath's Rath festival is being celebrated.
Those who have learned about Baba Saheb Ambedkar would have known that he praised Lord Jagannath's temple and his legacy because he incorporated social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
Only a few people know that a word called Jaggarnet in English means a chariot that cannot be stopped.
The meaning of this Jagarnatt's Nikhand is that this word is descending from Lord Jagannath's chariot.
We can understand from this fact how Jagannath's chariot travels have played an important role in his own way.
Everyone celebrated the holy month of Ramsan with pride.
Now I'm here.
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, many greetings to everyone.
The month of Rumsan is the month of holy charity, the month of enjoyment.
An inspirational incident took place in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, in this holy month of Ramsan.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters who are about 3500 years old live in that small village and in a way the sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population.
During this Rumsfeld, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
17 lakh rupees for the others of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mumbai for making this holy occasion of Ramsan an opportunity for the betterment of society.
Every act of them is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they made Mubarakpur free from external defecation.
Three states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala were already declared as ODF states.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also announced this week.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the people of these five states, the government, the authorities and the general public.
Only then will the habit of the body and the mind change.
It's the same thing as cleanliness.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
Last day, a nice incident took place in my eyes, and I would like to tell you.
It is possible in the district of Vijayanagar in Andhra Pradesh.
What was the goal
Build 10,000 toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats within 100 hours.
All my dear countrymen will be happy to know that the work of toilets has been successfully completed in 100 hours by joining the common people and the government.
71 villages were free from excretion.
In, through letters and airplanes.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on June 25, in memory of the period of urgency.
This awakening light of democracy is praiseworthy.
Democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
Attorney Vigilance is the Price of Liberty. The price of freedom is constant awareness.
There is a continuous awareness about democracy, therefore, the things that have been wounded to democracy have to be remembered.
And move forward in the direction of good things of democracy.
25th June, 1975, it was an unforgettable night for a democratic belief.
In a way, the government was making the country a prisoner.
The voices of the opposite suppressed.
Jaiprakash Narayan, along with the dignitaries of the country, was taken to jail.
The system of justice cannot be saved from that terrible shadow of emergency.
The newspaper's messenger was completely useless.
Students from today's press conference sector and those who are associated with democracy are constantly trying to enhance the awareness of the people of the Republic by reminding them of the dark period.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
During the last one year, Atal ji had written a poem in which he describes the poem as a mood of the time.
My dear countrymen, every Hindustani is proud of the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, he became a world-class meeting.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning.
Any Hindustani who is not proud of it.
The Yoga was not before, but when it was sacrificed by Yoga, Yoga became the glimpse of the world.
Almost all the countries in the world have made Yoga Day a chance.
In China, people were sitting on top of a larger pool and people were sitting at a height of 2400 meters above the sea level in Machu Pichuville, a world heritage.
In France, people did yoga in the shadow of this fruit tower.
The programme was organised in 70 places in a small country like Singapore and a week-long event was organised.
10 stamps related to International Yoga Day have been released by the United Nations.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at the United Nations headquarters.
The officials of the United Nations and all the negotiators around the world participated in this.
This time Yoga has once again created a world record.
About 50,000 people in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, together, made a new world record.
I also needed to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our armed forces, including BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF, have made Yoga a part of the work with their duty.
Some TV channels preached it.
The Hon'ble Prime Minister has heard that in recent times you have said in Kerala, instead of giving booby gifts at different places, good books should be given to memories.
This was started in Gujarat during your regime, but in recent times the use of bucks is more visible.
Can you do anything
Doesn't the country do anything to implement books instead of bucks
It's Khadi's clause to encourage Khadi.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this program continued, but after leaving it, the habit was left.
But in this programme of Kerala, I again got awakened.
And now it's starting to drop down.
Let's gradually turn it into a nature.
Boke's age is too low.
You're gonna leave it after you bought it in your hand.
Even if Khadi's clause was welcomed, it would be beneficial for poor families.
Expenditure will also be reduced, so it will be useful properly.
It's been years, but Elizabeth's queen has kept the castles given by Mahatma Gandhi.
Several types of letters are available, many people are burning.
Last day, I could read a letter, I would like to tell you about it.
In Tamil Nadu in southern coast, a family from sweets, Arulmozhi Sarvan sent me a letter.
I don't know what that guy was.
Considering the children's study, he thought of some economic activity and thought that the family might have some financial support.
Therefore, I borrowed from the bank under the Mudra scheme and started the work of supplying some goods from the market.
That is, Government departments will look into the registered e-General.
They're very interesting to write to me.
They said, "I got the money according to the Mudra scheme, started business and added the list that I could be given in e-General, and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office, from the PMO.
'I was also a new news.
They suggested what they bought at the PMO - they bought two thermos and got 1600 rupees.
This is power.
This is an opportunity to promote the industrial process.
It has efficiency, empowerment, and enormous industrialization.
Government E-Marketplace-Jam.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can also glorify our capabilities in space science.
Today, India is not only in the earth but also in the environment.
Two days ago, ISRO-Cartosat-2 series satellites launched 30 Nano satellites.
These satellites were from India and from 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, British and America.
This nano satellite movement of India will help in agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
We will remember that ISRO GST was successfully launched a few days ago.
This was the worst satellite in the satellites that India has launched so far.
The newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
That's what our scientists have done in the environment sector.
A thousand days of Mangalyaan Mission were completed on 19th June.
When the Mangalyaan Mission was successfully discovered, the Mission was aimed at achieving a total of 6 months.
Today, Indias badminton sportsperson Kedambi Srikanth won the Indonesian Opinion and enhanced the country's pride.
T.
Usha's Usha School of Athletics has got the opportunity to interact with the inaugural session of the Synthetic Track.
Sportsman Spirit also increases as much as we connect with sports.
Sports play a very important role in personality development.
The importance of sports is great in the overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If our family and children are interested in sports, they should be encouraged.
We all have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and continuous excitement, all together, gives a new experience at this time.
Once again, you're supposed to be swimming with manglasses, and you'll tell us something else in Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of the text of PMs address at the inaugural address of the Indian Community on 28th May, 2017 at 11.
Today, when I'm talking to you, the holy month of Ramasan has started.
On the auspicious occasion of Ramasan, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community.
Responsibility, spirituality and charity are very important in Romson.
It is our country that believes in God, who denies God, who worships idols, who opposes idol worship.
All the thoughts and traditions of all kinds and all kinds of traditions have created the art of living together.
Religions, castes, beliefs and traditions are our message of peace and harmony.
This month of Ramsan will help us move forward the path of peace and unity and harmony.
Once again, I'm glad.
I am very happy to know that many people have experienced me.
I've been excited to tell you what you're saying.
Everything couldn't be read, not with everyone's messages, so much information came.
But I saw everything together... some tried to learn music, some tried to learn new words, some tried to learn new things from the YouTube, some try to learn new languages.
I'm very happy to hear you a phone call.
I'm talking to Deepa Katiyal.
I had a reading habit.
But in this holiday, I decided to read something.
When it started reading about the freedom struggle, it was found that how many years have passed since the freedom fighters had to fight for freedom and how many sacrifices had to be taken.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has suffered a lot from young age.
Therefore, I request you to send a message to the new generation on this subject.
I am happy that the new generation wishes to know our history and our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
During the freedom struggle, the last great men in prisons did a lot of literary work.
Their pillars strengthened India's freedom struggle.
Years ago, once I went to Andaman Nicobar.
Cellular went to see the prison.
Veer Savarkar's birthday.
Veer Sarkar wrote a book titled 'Masi Birthday' in jail.
The poems were written in the wall of the prison.
He was locked in a small cell.
An Light and Santo Show is very inspiring.
Every language speaker from all the states of Hindustani had dedicated his life by experiencing Kalapani in this cellular jail in Andaman.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday.
What's the connection with nature
Being connected with nature is to protect the good land.
It's better than Mahatma Gandhi's words.
Mahatma Gandhi often used to say, "We need to take care of the unknowing world," (Won Master Care Abound A World One Wild Walk NOT C) that is, we need to think of the world that we don't see.
Nature has a power.
You might have experienced that when you get tired then how much energy can be felt by throwing a glass of water on your face
When you get tired, the windows of the house open, when the doors open, you can breathe into the wind, you will feel a new joy.
When we are in touch with these five elements that are built in the body, ourselves become a new creation and a new energy grows.
We've experienced all this, but we don't care, we don't take it to a stream.
Now, when you come to contact with nature, you must take care of whether there will be a new diversity within you.
Therefore, the Global Movement to connect with Nature on 5th June should be the initiative of each of us.
We have experienced the quality of preserving our predecessor's environment.
If we wait for the environment, we will get the benefit of it to the surface.
Whatever be it athlete, it is the most important guiding text of the environment that has been constructed thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth is called Prithvia.
In the Vedas, the sympathy of ours is due to our land.
The Earth is our mother, we are children.
In our country, many festivals and many rituals are related to the environment.
The love of nature is part of social life, whether educational, non-city, rural or tribal people.
Let's make it new words and explain new laws.
Some of the remarks from the States are news.
In most of the states, when the rainy season begins, there is a big campaign in the matter of tree walking.
Crores of trees are planted.
Schools, social organisations, government regimes and governments are moving ahead.
This time too, we have to encourage tree walks and give our contribution to it.
June 21 is coming, 21 June is a special day all over the world.
This day is celebrated as World Yoga Day.
Within a short span of time, the fame of June 21 Yoga Day has reached every corner of the world and connects people together.
On one hand, many divisive powers in the world show deformed forms, while India is giving a big contribution to the world.
Through Yoga, the world is able to shine in a chariot.
As the body connects minds, minds and souls, Yoga is connecting the world with each other today.
Two days ago, I had written a letter to all the governments and all the leaders of the world regarding Yoga.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
Some steps have been taken so slowly.
I congratulate those who sent these suggestions.
It's very interesting.
Grandpa, grandparents, grandmother, grandmother, mother, men and women, together with three generations and apload the picture.
This meeting will provide a new direction to Yoga tomorrow and tomorrow.
Tomorrow, this film will be a picture of tomorrow, and it will be a happy tomorrow's promise.
I invite you too.
There's more than three weeks left to be a global day.
This is a way of healthcare.
I invite everyone to be part of it.
When you took over the responsibility of the Chief Servant, I got the opportunity to speak for the first time on 15th August at the Red Fort in Delhi, I spoke about cleanliness.
Since then, I am going to different parts of India today.
What are some people doing
I'm grateful to him for seeing this thing.
If you hear this call, you'll understand.
Pranama Modi ji, I speak Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, I often see that people are paying special attention to cleanliness on TV and social media.
Be it in Mumbai or Surat, people have taken up Swachhta as a mission in a combined manner.
Not only the elderly but also the children are also aware of cleanliness.
Children who are blamed on the streets are slaughtered.
A few days back, I went to Gujarat's Kutch.
It is a greater pleasure than that even my journey is related to cleanliness.
The rest of the preparations to welcome the Prime Minister can be a habit, but now cleanliness is a big thing.
It gives pleasure to anyone who wants cleanliness, it is inspiring.
When Modi ji decides his journey, ask those who call me, where will cleanliness be
How many tons of chappals will you dedicate to me, let me decide whether to come or not.
"The idea is nice, but I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, it has to be an entrepreneur to make so many petals.
How many people can be saved from the disease.
What a great humanitarian matter
Look at these cattle as wealthy and as a wealthy one.
Don't see it as dirty.
If we start looking at these petals as wealthy, new ways of communications will be made to us.
Young people associated with Startups will also come up with new schemes and come up with new instruments.
In collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a big venture in terms of waste manufacturing with the help of people of the city.
On 5th June, the World Environment Day will provide appropriate collection of minerals and minerals in about 4,000 cities of the country.
There are two types of cavalry, one green and the other blue.
The kitchen wastes, green vegetable skins, food items, eggs and leaves are liquids, which should be put in green grass.
All this is beneficial in the fields and it will be reminded of what is in the greenery .
The second round is to include unnecessary mustards, iron ores, glasses, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken doubles, rubber stuff etc.
Versova Residents Volunteers took full responsibility for this.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am happy to tell you that the Reasi Block in Jammu Kashmir has been an external defecation free area related to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
I congratulate all the people of the Reasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the last fifteen days, for a month, in the newspapers, in the TV channels or in social media, the government's calculations are going on everywhere.
Three years ago, you took responsibility for me as the chief servant.
Several others walked, a lot of opinions took place.
I see this as a very healthy thing.
This three-year work has been changed in every way.
People from all walks of life have observed this.
This is the best way to democracy.
The governments should be responsible for democracy and the government should give account of their work.
I thank those who have known the greatest opinions.
Active criticism strengthens democracy.
This imagination is very important for the nation that awakens.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you, and as a common citizen, the effect of good and bad civilization is seen on me as a common citizen.
As I said, the effect of my mind as a common citizen, that's important.
Two days ago, a study book on Mann Ki Baat was composed of Honorable President, Hon'ble Vice President, Hon'ble Vice President, Hon'ble Speaker and Hon'ble Speaker, in Rashtrapati Bhavan.
I am very grateful to the President and the Vice President and the President of India, who have given importance to Mann Ki Baat while looking at time.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat presented a new curtain.
Some friends also discussed me during the work of the book on Manki Baat.
He said that he wants to make sketches about the topics he has spoken in Mann Ki Baat, and has given the art format for Akbar Saheb Mann Ki Baat to express his love without paying a rupee.
I'm grateful to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, the next time Mann Ki Baat says, the entire country will be rainy, the weather will change, the results of the examinations will come, the new study will start life... a new awakening and fragrance will spread everywhere.
In this environment, we can move forward by expressing love with nature.
My best wishes to you all.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on April 30, 2017 at 11 a.m.
Namaskar to my dear countrymen.
Children's curiosity, the ambitions of the youth, the experiences of the elderly...
Generally, it is people's nature to suggest others.
On the train, when someone goes to the bus, if someone gets coughed, the next one says, do it.
Consult, it's our nature.
First of all, when Mann Ki Baat got suggestions, he heard the voice of the advice and got something to learn, when the team felt that it would be a habit for many people to send it like this.
But when we tried to imagine it microscopicly, it was really overwhelmed.
Most of those who say these words, and those who try to come to me are actually doing something.
In order to do a good thing, they try their intelligence, strength, capability and climate.
When it comes to notice, it's a strange idea.
I am sorry to waste food in Mann Ki Baat last time.
This is an example of how things are going on in collaboration with the society.
Today is the end of April, the last day.
May 1 is the foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Nature has changed all the rules of the game.
The warmth in our country had to be felt in May-June this time in March.
When Mann Ki Baat accepted the opinions from the people, many people had sent information about what to do during this summer.
Everything is prevalent, not new, but it will be beneficial to repeat it at the right time.
Many friends starting from Karthi are worried about birds.
They said they should keep water in the utensils in Balkani and Terrace.
Small kids in the family are very excited about this.
Once they've noticed how to keep water, they've kept the utensils ten times a day.
I'll take care of whether the birds come.
We think it's a game, but in fact it's a good experience to wake up the past.
He lived up to 103 years.
Reflecting his centenary year, Bohra Samaj Burhani Foundation made a big effort to save the worms.
I got the chance to start it.
They distributed about 50,000 firecrackers to the world.
The Ginns Book of World Records found it.
Sometimes when the newspaper givers, the milkmen, the vegetables and the postman goes to the door, we forget to ask whether we want summer and water.
Young friends, I want to tell you something.
Many of our young generation are happy to live in a comfortable situation.
Parents also grow very safely.
But I would like to tell you how to stay your vacations.
New places, new experiences, new talents...
Sometimes you see something on TV, or read it on the book, or listen to the acquaintance... and feel the same thing...
Experiments may be socio-economic, let's get out of the cool breeze.
If we are from a middle class family, we're from a happy family.
You can see the happiness of playing in life never before.
You have wondered how many changes will come in their lives when children leading such a life in society get an opportunity to play with you.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Go to the jungle.
Sometimes summers will be organised, personality development cannons...
A number of development works will be done.
Everyone will be busy in their world with the strength of technology.
Social life is a culture, it's a power.
The other thing I said is that you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competition.
It's hard to buy a higher market, and some coaching will go to the class in the vacations, and the next exams will be in danger.
But keep in mind whether humanity is intact, and keep in mind whether it is going away from human qualities.
Can we take a little more care in skill development
Don't spend some time with yourself from the technology.
Search a musical instrument, learn 5-50 words of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathis and Punjabi...
Try to learn something you don't know, you must have some benefits.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a gynaecology, understand, talk to the people, ask them... it gives you a different pleasure to see there.
Try and decide yourself.
Don't lose time for a long journey.
Go to one place and spend three to four days.
Then go to another place and stay there for three to four days.
It can learn a lot of things.
Show me pictures where you're going.
Share your experiences using Hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has made you a good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from the trends.
They don't need money.
They're beginning to believe in digital transactions.
Do you think you can do this and wealth
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
BHIM APPY'S YOU DONLODUE.
Your account will be invested ten rupees from the government.
If you can add twenty people a day, you can spend 200 rupees for a long time.
Businessmen and students can afford this.
The project is up to 14th October.
You have played a key role in creating digital India.
You will be a guardian of New India.
Seasons and opportunity for wealth.
Introduce the digital.
Normally, our country has an atmosphere of hatred with VIP culture.
But now I understand that how deep the country is, however, the government has decided not to walk around with a red light in the vehicle.
It became a symbol of VIP culture in a way.
Although it was in a red light vehicle, it appears to have entered the mind of the people and became intellectually the VIP culture.
Now the red light has gone, so no one can claim that the red light on the head has gone.
I got a very interesting phone call.
People are worried about the red light.
The Government wants to talk about the red beacon light prohibition.
I read in the newspaper, each Indian has a segment of VIP.
I'm so proud of it.
Thank you for that.
Instead of VIP, it means that Every Person is the Egyptian Emergent, everyone has an importance.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to recall our history, our culture and our heritage.
This will give us energy, inspiration.
This year we will celebrate the thousandth birth anniversary of 25 billion Indians of Ramanujacharya.
We have been drifting in other things to remember only for centuries.
The centenary may be very important for other countries of the world.
Ourselves turned those who didn't belong to society through behaviors.
Thousands of years ago, he struggled to enter the temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are fortunate to have born great men in our society to save the evils of our society all the time.
On the auspicious occasion of Ramanujacharya's auspicious birthday, we will inspire to awaken the thought that it is powerful to constitute social unity.
The Union Government is launching a stamp on 1st May to remind Swami Ramanujacharya.
Swami Ramanujacharya is honored and honoured.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance on May 1 tomorrow.
Some people must be aware that we have been entitled to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect that the workers receive today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, while talking about Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya, the great Karnataka saint of the 12th century recalls Jagat Guru Basaveshwar, a social reformer.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
He had an opportunity to illuminate his verses.
In the twelfth century, he is deeply contemplated about the teachings and the teachings.
In Kannada, he said, "Cowe Kailas.
This means that you can reach Lord Shiva's magnificent castle through instruction.
I mean, you can get heaven by doing it.
I'm often called Shreyev Jayate.
Dattapatnth Tengudi ji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Massdur Group, reminds me often.
Today, it is natural to remember Dattapanth Tengadi when we talk about the workers.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Buddhism after a few days.
There will be people from all over the world associated with Lord Buddha.
Ashoka's life in India is an excellent example of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate to note that this festival of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations Vesak Day.
This time it's happening in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get the opportunity to honour Buddha in Sri Lanka.
His memories will get an opportunity to renew.
Dear countrymen, efforts have been made to move ahead with the mantra of Sabka Saath-SabkaVikas (development along with everyone) in India.
Sabka Saath-SabkaVikas is not only in India but also in the global context.
Especially in our neighbouring countries.
India South Asia satellite will be launched on May 5.
The capacity and facilities of this satellite will help in fulfil the economic and developmental predictions of South Asia.
It will help in creating a format of natural wealth, whether it is in terms of telemedicine or in terms of education, or in terms of deeper technology connectivity, whether people and people.
This is an important step in India to enhance cooperation with all South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic struggle against injustice is a wonderful victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore - His memories are traditional for us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore also composed the National Anthem of Bangladesh.
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive Nobel Prize in 1913, but also gave him the status of the British Nighthood.
Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who were protested when the British massacred in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919.
It was possible to deeply influence the minds of a child at the age of 12.
The boy, who laughed at fields and sports in his childhood, made a new inspiration for the cruel massacre of Jallianwala Bagh.
In 1919, the 12-year-old girl, Bhagat, is the inspiration of all of us and ours.
On 23rd March, Bhagat Singh and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru were weighed by the British.
We know that even at the time of death, Bhagwat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were happy to serve Bharatamba on their faces and could not die.
All the dreams of life were dedicated to Bharatamba's freedom.
These three heroes are inspired by us even today.
We cannot describe the guidance of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The British empire was afraid of these three.
The hall was covered in Jaili, the hall was sure, but the British had the idea of what it was about.
That's why he killed 23 people who decided to hang on March 24.
They did it unusually.
Then brought their body to Punjab today, and the British burnt it without knowing.
When I got the opportunity to go there a few years ago, I felt as if there was a particular impact on that planet.
I would like to tell the youth of the country that if you get the opportunity, you must visit the sanctuary of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Datt.
Its intensity, its rapidity, its propaganda was a growing period.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had been inspired by the youth for the war movement.
Gandhiji's thoughts and his style in the freedom struggle of India have been seen in Champaran.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 to inspire the nation.
Today, we cannot assess the Satyagraha of Champaran based on the shape of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
A man who returned to Hindustan in 1915... just two years...
It was just a beginning.
Let's see how hard he has to suffer at that time, how hard he's done.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to identify Mahatma Gandhis organizational strength and the ability to understand the common man of the country.
Mahatma Gandhi organized, inspired and fought the poor and illiterate people in front of the British Empire...
This marvellous power shows us the sight of Champaran Satyagraha, which we recognize the glory of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Mahatma Gandhi hundreds of years ago, then the Champaran Satyagraha is a big study for any person who starts a normal life.
Twenty-five crore Indians want to change and try to change this is the sure foundation of a New India.
New India is not a government concept, it is not a democratic party's performance paper.
New India is an admiration of hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
This is the concept of how hundred and twenty-five crore people together want to build a magnificent India.
There is an idea, an excitement, a imagination, a desire.
They're doing it like a luxury, like a silent servant.
There are many who go to the hospitals every day and help patients.
As soon as you know, there are many who run for blood donation.
If someone's hungry, there's a lot of people who think of giving them food.
We can say that our country is a magnificent man.
Our nerves have the concept of God.
Moreover, if we look socio-consciously, then how powerful will be formed by the group.
When we talk of a New India, we have to think about it, observe it and look at it through a different perspective.
If a hundred and twenty five crore people decide and determine the path, then the dream of a hundred and twenty five crore people of New India will be true in our eyes.
All this cannot be done by the budget, through government schemes, by the government.
If we decide that the transportation laws will be followed, if all citizens decide that they will be responsible for paying my debts, then every citizen will ensure that they don't use petroleum diesel one day a week...
You can see that this dream of a New India is fulfilled in this country with a hundred and twenty-five crore people.
This means that all citizens have to follow their commitments.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, people have been participating in the digital revolution called digital payment and have been curious about how to transfer money without money.
Even the poorest of the poor are trying to learn it, and gradually people are moving towards doing transactions without currency.
There have been several ways of digital payments after the notice cancellation programme.
It's been two and a half months after the BHIM App, but about 1.5 million people have loaded this down.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
Hundred and twenty-five crore people don't wait for one year if they want.
It's only six months.
We can do this in everyday life.
This means that you cannot imagine the greatest service to the nation and you will be brave in fighting against black money and corruption.
Several Digital Melas have been organized to teach people this and to make people aware.
100 programmes are planned across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
It also had gifts.
Thus, 125 million people have received gifts for consumers.
Eighty thousand people got gifts for traders.
Everyone has decided to move forward with this method.
April 14.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb on 14th April, the Digital Festival will end.
A big event is being held in a hundred days.
There's an arrangement for mega neglect.
In the days left to Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birthday, we will launch the Bhima App.
Please play our role in reducing the cash-deployment duties.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to receive a number of suggestions every time Mann Ki Baat comes from the people, but every time the requirements of cleanliness are rising.
The girl who is studying in the eleventh grade of Gayatri from Dehradun called Gayatri, called the message, "Pradhan Mantri, Pranamah, my best wishes to you all for the first time in this election.
I want to tell you my Manki Baat.
I want to tell you how much people need to understand cleanliness.
I'm going through a river every day, and people pour lots of petals on it, destroy the river.
"Brothers and sisters, look at the pain that a child studying in the eleventh grade is suffering from the destruction of the river.
The girl gets angry when she sees the squirrels in the river.
I see it as a good sign.
Since the launch of Swachhta Abhiyan, there has been a new awakening in the country.
The hatred of the waste is increasing.
Walk up, be active partnership, be born... it has its own importance.
I want to tell all those who listen to Gayatri in my Mann Ki Baat today that Gayatri's message is a message for all of us.
Everything that sees is filled in the plate, can't eat it all.
It's not a matter of telling anyone.
In our houses, when the mothers call the children, they say, male or female, take it.
Secondly, if it doesn't benefit a little, it's financially for the family.
It is a good thing to think for society, but it is beneficial for the family.
I'm not compulsory in this, but I pray that there should be more waking up.
I know the young people who are doing great things about it.
They made a mobile app for this.
When people know that there's such a snack, they're calling it, and they're using it properly.
This is the youth of our country.
We can see people like this somewhere in all the states of India.
We can be inspired not to swallow their life.
As far as you can eat.
Look, it's the way to change.
Those who are cautious about health will always say - keep your stomach and your feet and keep your plate a little foot.
Remember the 7th of April when we talk of health, the world is healthy day.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has set a target of health for all by 2030.
This time, the United Nations is focusing on depression on World Health Day on April 7.
We also know the word depression, but if the word means, some people call it depression.
According to one estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are under stress.
If a psychological environment is created, it starts liberation.
The first mantra is to say it openly rather than stopping the depression.
Tell friends, parents, brothers and teachers what your mentality is.
Sometimes loneliness, especially children in the hostel, may have more trouble.
The beauty of our country is that we are living in the family, and there is a large family, and each other's neighbourhood, which reduces the risk of depression.
Otherwise, everybody doesn't go out together, I don't come, keep in mind whether to stay alone.
Please give him an opportunity to be with him to speak openly to him.
Smile and smile and inspire him to talk, bring him out what's sorry in.
It's a good way.
Depression is a cause of physical and mental disease .
As diabetes becomes the master of all kinds of diseases, depression is also unsuccessful in fighting, daring and determining.
If you don't open yourself in front of yourself, seek help from someone who has some other service or service.
Help yourself and share your happiness.
If you try to understand the sadness of someone else, you will have a new self-confidence within you.
If someone is associated with others, you can reduce the weight of your mind by selflessly serving someone.
Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga helps in many ways to get rid of depression, to get rid of stress, to get rid of stress and to get rid of happiness.
June 21 is the International Yoga Day.
Last day, the Union Government has taken a big decision.
The number of women working in our country is increasing every day and welcoming that their share has increased.
Responsibility of the family has to be shared in domestic financial responsibilities, which requires injustice to the newborn babies.
Therefore, the central government took a big decision.
India has taken such a big decision for these brothers and sisters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April is the pilgrimage of Ramnavami and on 9th April is Mahavir Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Let us inspire the lives of these great men and empower them to swear for a New India.
Two days later, the Chaitra Shukla Respect, the New Year is coming, and in this New Year, you all have many Mangalas.
This is the beginning of the harvest after the spring, when the farmers start getting the results of their learning.
This New Year is celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
As a New Year in Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Chadi-Chand for Sindhis, Navareh in Kashmir, Samvatsarpuja in Awadh region, Jud-Cheetal in Mithila in Bihar, Satwani in Magadha.
India is such a diverse country.
My best wishes to you all in this new year.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on February 20, 2017 at 11 a.m.
After the leaves, new leaves have started coming in trees.
Flowers bloom.
Gardens and gardens are green.
The sound of birds attracts the heart.
Not only flowers, but shining fruits are also seen in the branches of trees.
As a result of summer, the flowers of mango start showing on spring.
Ameer Khusro leaflets have been very interestingly describing these changing moments.
Ameer Khusro writes: "Fool Rahi Sarasom Sakal Ban, Ambawa Footte, Tesu Fulekoyal Bole, Dar-Dar (screaming wherever the skulls are flown), when the nature is happy, the sums are enjoyable, the humans also enjoy you.
Vasantapanchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi Festival, all are filled with happiness in human life.
Many people are not aware of the achievements of the ISRO.
So they say that 104 satellites have been disseminated and information about interceptor missiles.
Shobhaji, I express my heartfelt gratitude to you for remembering Indias proud achievement.
Technological and scientific roles have been shown in fighting poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, obtaining knowledge.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have made the need to enhance India's supremacy in front of the world.
We all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in the past years.
ISRO has set up a World Record in Shunakasha last day after its success in reaching Mangalyaan on Mars.
The ISRO has successfully disseminated 104 satellites from different countries including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UE and India.
India is the first country in the world to create history by bringing 104 satellites together into the atmosphere.
It is a matter of great pleasure that PSLV is being successfully launched for the third time.
This is not only the ISRO but also the whole history of India.
ISROs cost effective and efficient environmental mission is surprising all over the world.
The world has conveyed its best wishes to the scientists of India.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is the most important.
Some pictures have been drawn as soon as our satellite arrives.
It's starting to work.
It is a matter of great happiness that our young scientists and our female scientists have led the entire leadership of this mission.
This is an important part of the success of the ISRO.
I extend my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO in the name of the people of the country.
For ordinary people, their goal of bringing the environment to the nation has always been to them and everyday the new pillars are pushing them into their crown.
India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile in the field of Security.
You will be happy to know that only four or five countries in the world have achieved this achievement.
Scientists of India have displayed this.
The result is that even if Missile, which is targeted for India, is 20000 kilometers away, the Missile is destroying it in the interior.
We are happy to see new technologies and new scientific technologies.
Judgment has played a big role in human development journey.
Efforts are being made to know the universe, creation and human minds.
New science and new technology are born from it.
Every technology and every new form of science gives birth to a new age.
My dear youngsters, we are talking about the hard work of science and scientists, and often I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation will enhance the spirit of science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today scientists have become the cause of a new transformation in the life of the future.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say: A science has not been broken from the sky in a fragmented form.
All sciences are developed and tied upon experiences.
"I express my heartfelt gratitude to the spirit, spirit and dedication that led them in the search of modern scientists after the truth.
Science is aimed at the needs of the common people and how to use those principles, what should be the medium of technology, because it is considered to be the most important contribution of the common people.
Recognizing and displaying such inventions, informing people about how such inventions can be beneficial for the common people, how more products can be made and how commercial use can be done.
Sometimes problems show the importance of science to find peace.
All arrangements are being followed by technology.
In a way technology turns into an incredible part of our lives.
In the past, the DG-Dhan scheme was very important.
Specially, digital payments have become habituated by younger generations through their mobile phones.
I see this as a good wish.
Our country has been supporting the Lake Grahak Yojana and the Digi Dhan Business Yojana in the past.
For nearly two months, fifteen thousand people get a reward of Rs.
Through these two schemes, digital payments in India have been accepted across the country.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh consumers have been given a gift of Rs.
More than four thousand traders have received a reward of Rs. 50,000.
The farmers, the traders, the small businessmen, the other workers, the homeless and the students are actively involved in this.
Asked whether young people come or not or not, they say that there are 15-year-old men and 65-70-year-old men.
Mr. Anandji of Mysore is happy to write on the Narendra Modi App and he received a thousand rupees as a gift under the Lucky Grahak Yojana.
And then I thought they were giving me a thousand rupees, and I gave them the thousand rupees.
I am very happy, happy, your name and your work are all ours.
You've done an inspirational act.
In Maharashtra, a young friend, Pooja Nemade Post Graduate is a student who shared his experience with others how they use Rupee Card e-wallat and how happy they can use it in the family.
The Lucky Grahak Yojana will be completed in 100 days on 14th April.
Baba Saheb is the birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
On 14th April, a big reward of Rs.
Now it's only forty-five days left.
You can't talk about this while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary.
Remembering him, you also learn to download at least 125 people.
Teach how the purchase of money is going on, especially the nearby small traders.
This time, give special importance to Bheem App to Baba Saheb Ambedkar's Jayanti.
Go home and get everyone together to 125 crore arms to the BHIM App.
Over the last two-three months, this campaign has been successful in many townships, in many villages, in many cities.
The farmers of our country have made food grains that will improve the recard this year.
Our farmers give all the information that all the records have been corrected in the past.
Seeing the harvest of the fields, Pongal and Vaishali are being celebrated today.
This year more than two and a half million tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and made a variety of peasant species in about 290 lakh hectares of agricultural land.
The government is constantly trying.
Last day, under the leadership of the Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation of the Government of India, a programme of senior officers from 23 states was organised in Telangana.
We can see wealth from waste.
It's a proverb.
If a six-year-old family has a standard double toilet, it will be filled for nearly six years.
After that, the dirt can be left back to the second entrance.
Within six to twelve months, the dirt of the gallery is completely decomposed.
It's absolutely safe to handle such a decomposition, and it's a very important vibrant NPK.
The farmers are well aware of the NPK network.
Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are completely nutritious and are considered to be very good in the agriculture sector.
Others will have to take such steps as the government has taken this step.
Several departments are regularly observing Swachhta Taiwaar.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development, in consultation with the Ministry of Tribal Development, is going to strengthen sanitation in the first week of March.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, along with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, moves forward on the second island of March.
We all know that whatever citizens of our country do well, the entire country will be able to realize that the whole country has reached a new dimension.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of the achievements of our divine friends.
I believe that the divine brothers and sisters are skilled and determined, brave and emotional.
And we get to learn something from them.
Whether it's a matter of sports or climate science, women in our country are not behind anyone.
We are moving forward in a simultaneous manner and enhancing the name of the country by embracing achievements.
Our women have won swimming in Asian Ragbi Sevens Trophy recently.
My best wishes to those players.
On 8th March, the World Women's Day is celebrating.
Today it's not just a government program.
The thinking of the people of the old traditions that have been going on for years has changed.
It's a pleasure to hear the news that the girl was born to be celebrated.
In a way, positive thinking towards girls has become a cause of social recognition.
Children's marriages were prevented through a special census in Gudalur district of Tamil Nadu.
So far, about 175 children have been able to stop marriages.
Under the Saukanya Samriddhi Yojana, bank accounts have been opened for more than 50,000 and more than 4000 girls.
Under the Convergence Model in Katwa district of Jammu Kashmir, every section has been included in the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme. With the organisation of village councils, the district government is making a lot of efforts to enable orphan girls to die and ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, under the programme 'Harghar Dastak', a birthplace is being organized for the education of girls in every village and every household.
Rajasthan, our children, our school, Apna Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, implemented a scheme to re-scholarize and re-scholarize the children who have been disadvantaged with education.
In contrast, the Beti Bachao and Beti Padhao schemes are taking various forms.
I see it as a good symptom.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country enjoys the rainy season, on the other hand every corner of India has any kind of festivals or fairs.
It's like this until Diwali.
Perhaps our ancestors have created a cyclone, economical and social life in such a way that there is no stiffness in the society in any environment.
In the past, we celebrated many festivals.
Everyone can find solutions to today's problems from Shri Krishna's life.
Despite all these significance, take Sarath's job on the battlefield.
Sometimes pick up the mountain, sometimes press the food leaf.
I mean Krishna feels a new thing.
So, when I talk to you today, I pay my attention to the two enthusiasts.
One is a sighted cycle of charm and the other is a charming charm.
Sudarshan Chakradhara Mohen left the shore of Yamuna and went to the seashore of Gujarat and stayed in Dwarka city, and Mohen, born on the seashore, finally reached Delhi on the banks of Yamuna.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna by laughing at all the heights of life within weeks.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about Mahatma Gandhi's 100th birth anniversary.
The new Kirti Stambha was established by bringing a new path to human history.
The spirit of service, service and the commitment towards service was always a part of his life, which was associated with Mahatma Gandhi.
In his life, the example of service has been forwarded.
Mahatma Gandhi's individuals, society, humanity and humanity.
Whether it is the Finics Family in Africa or the Tolstoy Family or the Sabarmati Ashram or the old age, he always emphasized the need for a separate social gathering everywhere.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to go to many important places related to Popular Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi gave importance to institutionalism with a sense of service.
We have to bring the ideas of social service, social development and social constituency in our lives.
In fact, this is the concentration of Mahatma Gandhi.
There will be many opportunities like this, we will gather together.
But what's Gandhi 150
What can you think of these efforts as a person
Think of what value is to be alone.
Ladies Club.
Let's continue things in the latest Ladies Club, but all the members of the Ladies Club, together, don't do anything.
You can do a lot.
Specify old books, distribute information to the poor.
130 crore people will have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore gardens will be inaugurated.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
During the freedom struggle, the salt Satyagraha in Dandi was a great path.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
I also request you to visit a place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
Wherever it can be - Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, Aadha Ashram, And in Delhi, anywhere related to Mahatma Gandhi.
When you go to such a place, you must share your pictures in social media and others will be inspired by it.
This time, in the Indian pavilion of Venice Binal, there have been exhibitions of great interest in Gandhijis memories.
There was a special attraction for the Haripra Panel.
You will recall that the Congress General Conference was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected President in history.
These art exhibitions have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura session of the Congress, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nandlal Bose at Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan in 1937-38.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people of India and to showcase his artwork in the Mahasammun.
Nandlal Bose, along with his artistic constitution, also resonated.
Nandlal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and finally brought some pictures showing the life of rural India.
These precious artworks became a big church in Venice.
Once again, on the occasion of Gandhiji's 100th birth anniversary, I appeal to all Indians to take a decision.
For the country, for the society, something else has to be done.
That's the best, the real, the real thing that can be forbidden.
Over the last few years, we have been doing a programme that covers the entire country for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will begin on September 11.
This time, plastic has to be given special importance.
On 15th August, I recalled how much enthusiasm and zeal that hundred and twenty-five crore people had organised a mass movement for waste management and worked to get rid of excretion.
Similarly, we have to stop using single-use plastic only once.
In this regard, people from all sections of society are very excited about this.
Many of my brothers and sisters in the business have put a borrow in front of the shop and have written that those who come to buy the goods should be brought to the sanji.
This can also benefit the money and their contribution towards the safety of the environment.
This time on 2nd October, when we celebrate Bapu's 100th birth anniversary, we will not only dedicate to him an outer defecation free India but will also lay the foundation stone for a new mass against plastic.
I'll turn it into a fuel.
What is more inspiration than Gandhiji
Dear Countrymen, our Sanskrit Specifics are in a way wise.
We'll get what we need in our lives.
I want to tell you a big deal through a cultured synthesis.
It was written centuries ago, but it is still very important.
One of the best instruments is Prithviaam Trini Ratnani Jalman, Subhasitammui Pashanakhandesh Ratan Sanjya, which has three versions like water, cereals and sub-division on earth.
The fools call the stone a blood.
In our culture, Anna was very glorious.
We made the information about Anna even science.
The awareness of the need for nutrition is changing the country through modern scientific methods.
People fight against malnutrition through new and attractive methods.
Similarly, in the days of the harvest, the servants of the Anganwadi pay each grain from the people.
These pulses are used for making hot food for children and women.
After this, the person becomes self-dedicated to this goal and becomes a soldier of the people's family.
We all must have heard about a function called Annaprashan in all parts of India.
This is the first time to give rice to the children.
No fluid, no hard food.
Somewhere people donate food.
When people of the family come to Anganwadi or school, they take nutritious food, enjoy good taste and enjoy themselves to the children from family.
Share their happiness and share others.
It is a good composition of service and happiness.
Friends, There are several small things like this that can fight successfully against malnutrition.
Today, poverty and wealth are suffering due to lack of nutrition and malnutrition.
Nutritious food will be celebrated throughout the country in September.
You must also be part of it, add new programmes and share your share in it.
It means that if you can save someone from malnutrition then we can save ourselves from malnutrition.
Everything I've visited in the last week, where people have seen Man Vs.
However, I have never thought that the opportunity to touch the minds of the youth around the world will be in life.
What's happening
Last week we went to Bhutan.
As the Prime Minister, from the time I got the opportunity to go anywhere, from the time I have got the opportunity to sit next to all those who have the opportunity to attend the International Day of Yoga.
There is no big leader who doesn't discuss Yoga in the world, this is my experience throughout the world.
The Discussion Channel is planned to transmit this program in 165 countries in its language.
I am confident that this episode of the Discovery Channel will help a lot in introducing the world about the message of India, the heritage of India, the tradition of India, and the natural coexistence in the cultural journey of India.
Today, people want to know about the steps taken for climate conservation and clean environment in our country.
Did you shoot again and again
I'm asking you very quietly.
Look, there's no secret.
I'll tell you the secret because you have this question in everyone's mind.
Or no secret.
The truth is that technology was used in a conversation with Bear Grills.
Whatever I say, it's spoken in English, he used to hear through a small instrument that was in the ears of Bear Grills.
I mean, I was in Hindi but he was listening to English, so it was easy to talk, that's the wonderful thing to show technology.
After this show, many spoke to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must go to places related to nature and wildlife.
I've said this before and again, we have to move north-east of India.
We need to spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, the thoughts of environmental concerns and concerns in India are naturally seen to protect nature.
Last month, I got the opportunity to get out of the country's Tiger Census.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
India has 2967 tigers.
A few years ago, it was only half of it.
In 2010, a summit was organised for tigers at St. Petersburg, Russia.
A determination was made by expressing concern over the reduction in the number of tigers in the world.
It was determined to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But it's a New India, and we're gonna be fast.
We doubled the number of tigers by 2019.
The number of tigers in India has doubled not only the number of protected sectors and community reserves.
Several steps have been taken in the Gir forest.
In 2007, it was decided to appoint female guardians.
Infrastructure has been increased to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about protection.
We have to think of sympathy beyond protection.
Our scientifics have great advice on this.
Listen to what we have said in our sciences centuries ago, the destitute, the impoverished wilderness, the wilderness, the wilderness, the wilderness, the wilderness, the wilderness, the wilderness, the wilderness, and the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife of the humans
Dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
This Indian young sanctuary, which has captured mankind all over the world, has established Indias brightest personality in the world.
The world looked forward to any slave India, the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893 bound the world to change the perspective of India.
Come, let us try to live with the true strength of India that Swami Vivekananda saw the form of India.
But I don't pass through the details.
Wait until August 29.
In order to get rid of plastic, we all try to get rid of all the strength everywhere and everywhere.
I am confident that this movement will be filled with social media.
Come, let us move forward with a new zeal and a new determination.
We can move forward by expressing the joy of the inside with a sense of service.
English rendering of PMs address to the people of India on January 20, 2017 at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen, greetings to everyone.
Everyone celebrated our Republic Day on 26th January with joy and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
The Constitution of India, the commitment of the citizens, our commitment to the rights of the citizens and our commitment to democracy is a cultural festival that makes the future levels aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
However, in our country, there is no longer any discussion about the duty of the citizens and the rights of the citizens.
At the same time, it shows a social perspective, determination and respect for the martyrs.
Everyone has a natural respect for the army and the security personnel in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the Veer Jawans and their family, who have been honored with various bravery awards.
These scriptures include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Can you do something, especially the young people, who are actively involved in social media
On the one hand, when we heard the joyous and zealous occasions on 26th January, the brave news of our army from Kaval came to Kashmir for the sake of the country's security.
I pay my homage to those brave men and bow down to them.
My young friends, you know that I express my heart regularly through the programme Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March and April is the period of examinations in every family.
When I learnt about this, many teachers, parents and students sent me messages, asked me questions, suggested, pained and pointed out the sufferings.
After seeing all this, I want to share my thoughts with you.
I got the telephone message of a child named Cresti.
Listen, Sarshtri says, "Sir, I want to tell you that there is a terrible atmosphere in our homes and society during the examination.
That's why children get encouragement instead of getting encouraged.
Only a few people who are happy for the exam.
Exams for most people are an opportunity of stress.
That's what happens in us, that's what comes out.
There is a feeling of strength on the occasion of the festival of society.
The best is revealed.
During the examination, there should be an excitement between family and friends and neighborhood.
Pressure, you'll see that the pressure turns into a plaster, and the pressure becomes happy.
Festivalism makes the mind weightless.
Look, it's gonna change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months are exams.
You must understand that the power to call memories is the most peaceful in mind.
If you're density, all the doors are closed, the outside doesn't come in, the inside doesn't come out.
There is a hurdle in thought process, it turns into a weight.
I am telling from my experience that if there is a mental stress, we forget, if there is peace, we will not be able to imagine it, it will be very useful.
You don't know the problem, it's not that you didn't learn.
But when you have a mental stress, your knowledge, knowledge and learning are buried, your mental stress is suppressing all this.
Life seems to be a problem.
You're gonna think you're gonna write a year-long study exam.
P.
J.
If he was disappointed because of that failure, if he had failed with his life, then you should have thought that India would have received such a great scientist or would have met such a great President.
Therefore, the competition has grown, and there has been an increase in stress among students.
Mark and Mark Sheet have a very limited use.
It's not all in life.
Life is based on how much knowledge you have achieved.
If you believe in these things, you're gonna lose the Mark Wall and you're gonna need to go after the Mark.
Benefits your knowledge in life, beneficiaries of skills, beneficiaries of self-confidence, beneficiaries of determination.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
So, Mark's weight stops us from walking on the right track.
But if you focus on the market, you'll gradually limit you to certain things.
This is a very psychological struggle.
Indeed, the competition is not useful to lead life and it is necessary to compete with you to move forward in your life.
How can it be better than the last day
How can the chance to come be better than what happened
Sometimes you've seen it in the games, and you'll get to know it quickly, so let's say the example here.
The characteristics of their lives are that they are competing themselves in most of the winners.
Earlier, there was no sleep because of the stress of the test, is there any sleep now
Second, you're worse than him.
Third, it's equal.
Just take care of how we can do better than what we did earlier.
The Prime Minister expressed his views on the role of beauty savers.
He said that the role of the parents in the matter of examination is very important.
Because the mothers are more aware of the future of children at home, they are simplifying things.
If you've learned to accept, more problems will end there.
So I'd like to tell my parents that you're doing this to the children.
Do you think you'd give the kids an end of laughing in the days of the test
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very interesting call came.
Because I worked like that in my childhood, and I tried to copiate once in my childhood.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find ways, and I lost a lot of time.
"You're right.
Sometimes when I don't believe in my own talent, I'll see the close aide if I have written correctly.
Perhaps we've written it right, the next one wrote it wrong.
Well, we're gonna misunderstand ourselves.
I mean, there's no better than copies.
It's like lying, so don't do it.
Copieddy makes you worse, so don't copied.
"What is a Prime Minister, tells children to play at the time of the examination, I am angry.
Because it is generally believed that students are neglected in learning carefully in sports.
This idea is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If there is a comprehensive development, then there is a life outside the books, which is very wide.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to make life.
This is called maintenance.
Three things are important in my perspective in terms of exams - the right rest, the second sleep for the body, the third intellectual activity and a large part for the body.
So the rest of the body needs an opportunity to work.
Have you ever thought of seeing the sky, seeing the trees and trees, or enjoying the hearts
Long breathing leads to tension.
There is no need to stay in the room to breathe deeply.
Some people think they'll sit overnight and learn more.
You must sleep for your body.
So you won't lose time to learn.
A guy who came to see me about it asked, How long are you sleeping
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor
He said, while speaking during the election, your locking voice is linked to sleep.
If you sleep enough, your volcano code will get the rest.
He didn't think of sleeping and Wolkel code and my voice. He gave me a big medicine.
But it doesn't mean only sleeping.
So don't do that.
If you can, don't...
Or it'll be a weight, and I'm also inviting your family's parents not to weigh.
Keep in mind your determinations, trust yourself in your capacity and try.
My best wishes.
Festivals to win all the exams.
And it won't be tested.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Dear Countrymen, Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the Coast Guard officials and the soldiers for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard has secured the position of the fourth largest coastal force in the world by uniting 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in our country.
By empowering this philosophy, the Coast Guard is comfortably maintaining the nations maritime territories and the sea-shore environment in adverse environment.
Last year, the Coast Guard jawans took a big step towards cleaning the seashore of our country with their responsibility.
Thousands of people participated in it.
It is indeed a matter of great appreciation that they thought of the seashore cleanliness along with coastal security.
Only a few people should know that in our country, not only men, but women, shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to shoulder responsibility is successful.
Our Female Officer Pilate and Observers of the Coast Guard are not only working but also controlling the Hower Craft.
Today, maritime security is one of the most important issues in the world, therefore, hundreds of years of Indian Coast Guard's forty-fourth anniversary for those who are engaged in the great work of maritime security of India.
The Festival of Vasanta Panchami is on 1st February.
Spring is believed to be the best tower.
It's known as the king of springs.
There is a festival of Vasanta Panchami Saraswati Puja in our country.
This is considered an opportunity to worship the trick.
Not only that, it is a celebration that inspires the brave men.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola - this is inspiration.
My best wishes to my fellow citizens on the auspicious occasion of this Vasantapanchami.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat Akashvan gives new looks in their own way.
Since last month, my Mann Ki Baat has started listening to Mann Ki Baat in local languages.
I once again congratulate the Akashvani for their inspiration and many greetings to the countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat is giving me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Hundreds of good wishes.
Today is an opportunity to serve and sacrifice in life.
Jesus Christ said, "The poor need us not beneficial, but our acceptance."
St. Luke specifically says, 'It is not just Jesus, but also the service that the poor have served.' This is the real strength.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave it a lot, but the widow gave it to them on December 25.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to reduce the inception of many developmental activities in the Tapostoms of Malviyaji in Banaras.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre, built there, will be beneficial for people not only in Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also in Jharkhand Bihar.
Today, our former Prime Minister Bharat Ratna is the birth anniversary of Honorary Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contributions of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we also raised the nation in terms of Paraman Shakti.
Atal ji established great ideals as the leader of the party, as the World Assembly, as the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister.
On the birthday of Atal ji, I salute him and pray to God for his health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are reflecting.
When I tweeted this morning, I have shared an old video and I know how I was fortunate to get the opportunity to rise to the love of Atal ji as a small worker.
Today, in Christmas, the countrymen are going to get the benefits of two projects as Christmas Prizes.
The project was started in a way on the second of November.
There is an atmosphere of ambition all around the country, whether it is a village or a city or an educational person, whether it is neglectful or not, how can cashless payments be made between them and how to buy goods without money.
Everyone wants to learn and learn.
In order to promote this, the Government of India is launching programmes for consumers and small traders to strengthen mobile banking and become e-payment habits.
This is not just a day, but this scheme is going on from today to 100 days.
Every day, fifteen thousand people get a thousand rupees.
For centuries, millions of families are going to receive a gift of crores of rupees and you are deserving a gift by refuting digital payments like mobile banking, e-Banking, rubber card, UPI and USSD.
The DG-Dhan Business Yojana is mainly aimed at traders.
The scheme is aimed at every section of the society, especially the poor and the underlying sections of the middle class.
Therefore, those who buy more than 50 rupees and more than 3000 dollars will get such a gift.
Those who buy goods for more than three thousand rupees cannot get this gift.
Feature phones, ordinary phones can be purchased by poor people using USD, selling goods, selling money, and all of them can be beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the presentation scheme.
If you ask them that the next youngsters will know this thing, I know that they will tell you everything and they will have children studying in your family and 10 and 12, and they will tell them well.
You're as simple as you send a watch-up message through your mobile phone.
Dear countrymen, how to use technology, how to do e-payments and how online payments are spreading rapidly in the country.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200-300 times.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The business community can imagine how big this decision is.
The Digital Delivery Traders incentives income tax while promoting online payments instead of notice in their business.
Andhra Chief Minister Shri.
Someone said that the Assam government has decided to pay 10 percent of the allowance if it is closed to the digital payments and license fees.
If the branches of rural banks make at least two digital transactions between January and March through their 75 per cent transactions, they get a gift of Rs.
On 31st March, 2017, 100 per cent of the digital transactions have been announced as a gift of Rs. 5 lakh from the Government as per the scheme for digital transactions.
They also announced the Digital Crude Shiromani Scheme to the farmers, which will give Rs. 5000 to the first 10 farmers who have done digital payments to buy seeds and cattle.
Congratulations to all the governments on their initiatives.
Several organizations have also taken several successful initiatives to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
GNFC-Gujrat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. for the convenience of the farmers, especially focused on the growth, has established thousands of POS machines in the Value Sales Centres and in a few days, it has been done in just two weeks.
The most interesting thing is that compared to last year, the GNFC grew by 27 percent in sales.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters made a lot of progress in startups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technologies and new projects, our youth should give importance to this sector as far as possible.
And we can partner with all the strengths in the movement to save the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I ask people first in Manki Baat every month to share your opinions and tell you.
Thousands of suggestions received in MyGov and Narendra Modi App this time, 80-90 per cent was about the backdrop of corruption and the fight against black money.
Some have detailed detailed reports of various problems and discomforts faced by the people.
Another collector wrote that it is a good thing for the betterment of the country, despite doing so much sacred thing, what new ways of belief find out where all kinds of thieves are going on.
I am grateful to the people for writing so many letters and helping me.
The feelings of Gurumani Kewal appear in every corner of the country.
We all know it.
When people are suffering, who are the people who don't have pain in it when they suffer.
I'm sorry to feel like you are.
I clearly know that if a hundred and twenty five crore people are standing together, nothing is impossible and people are the sympathizer of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the people on this great campaign against corruption and black money.
The law is the same to all.
Whether it is a person or an organisation or a political party - everybody has to follow the law.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and black money are trying their best to find out the shortcomings of the government.
This government is for the common people.
It's constantly trying to know the opinions of the people.
What is the problem for the people, what is the reason for the problem and what is the solution for it.
As an ever-responsive government, how many rules have to be changed in keeping with the comfort of the people and the goal is to reduce the sufferings of the people.
On the other hand, I said it was an extraordinary struggle, on the eighth day.
For 70 years, all the powers have been incorporated in black money transactions with trust and corruption.
How much is their strength
When they are determined to fight with such people, they are embracing new methods everyday to defeat the government.
When they follow new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
You mean, I'll give you ten because it's decided to make corrupt people, thieves and black money free.
On the other hand, on the other hand, what kind of thieves are happening and how new methods are discovered and other information letters have been received from others.
In this context, I would like to congratulate my dear countrymen.
More information is available from the common people than the information provided by the government system.
Often success comes because the common people are waking up.
Can anyone imagine how dangerous the people of my country are challenging to bring out such powers
They say, Modi ji, don't be weak, don't stand, don't stand any hard footwear, but we need to go a long way forward.
I especially thank the writers because they have faith in their letters and blessings.
I took it out, made a strong 'Benami Wealth Act'.
In the coming days, the law will begin to work.
For nationhood, whatever to do for the cause of birth, it will be predicted.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last time, I had said that our farmers have improved the records of the last year in the midst of these hardships.
It is a good luck for the agriculture sector.
Last day, India has been proudly named in many fields in the world economy and as a result of continuous upgradation of our people, Indias rising vision in global rankings is seen through different indicators.
Indias rank in World Bank's Doing Business Report is high.
According to the Global Investment Report released by Dutch Ita, Indias ranking in the Top Prospective Host Economies for 2016-18 is third.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of World Economic Forum.
In the Global Innovation Index 2016, we have moved 16 places and the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index has increased 19 ranks in 2016.
Even after reviewing several other reports, the same way is progressing and India is moving fast.
But in this situation, it is very happy to see that some good things happen.
The government is committed to the divine people.
I personally tried to speed up this move.
My goal was to get the rights and respect for the divine people.
Our divine brothers and sisters have empowered our efforts and beliefs when they achieved four medals in Paralympics.
They not only raised the country's pride in that success but also surprised the people with their skills.
Our divine brothers and sisters, like all the citizens of the country, our invaluable wealth is strong.
I am very happy that after the passage of this law for the betterment of the diaspora, I am happy that there will be opportunities for the people of Diaspora to get jobs.
Government jobs have increased the coverage to 4 percent.
The Act envisages specific provisions for education, other facilities and complaints of the Divisionals.
It can be imagined that in the last two years, the government has organised four and thirty-thirty-three pillars in the last two years that the government has been sensitive to the divine people.
The government has passed the new legislation according to the will of the United Nations.
Earlier Divyangar was of seven types.
My young friends are also associated with this group like Thalassemia, Parkinson and Spirituality.
The news from the games for the last few weeks was proud of us.
It is natural for us to be proud as Indians.
The Indian cricket team won four volunteers against England.
Some of these young sportspersons were greeted.
Test captain Virad Kohli gave a good leadership with a good batting.
Indian cricket team's offspinner Bowler Ar.
Junior Hockey team made Wald Cup.
After fifteen years, Junior Hockey team gets Wald Cup.
Many congratulations to you for this achievement.
This achievement is a good wish to the Indian Hockey team.
Last month, our women were also surprised.
The Indian Women's Hockey Team also won Asian Champions Trophy a few days ago, the Indian Women's Hockey Team was also ranked in the 18 Asian ships.
Cricket and hockey team players are heartfeltly congratulated.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
We were celebrating Diwali last month.
Some have written poems, some have drawn pictures, some have cartoons, some have made videos.
I mean, how many houses turned into military posts.
I am surprising to see how emotional and visualising these letters are still.
With all your partnerships, the book will be prepared by giving you your imaginations about the army of the country and your vision towards the security evening.
A young man wrote to me, Prime Minister, we will take all the festivals like Holi and Diwali to the soldiers on the border.
Every minute, the country's security can be immersed in thinking.
However, the house will be remembered during the festivals.
But the truth is that this time it wasn't.
It's a celebration, it wasn't thought of home.
We also felt that Diwali was celebrated with hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases 125 crore times.
Just a few days back, all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir came to see.
They were the people of Jammu and Kashmir's Panchaya.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in the Kashmir valley.
I got to talk to them for a while.
However, when the conversation progressed, the situation in the valley, the law and order and the future of children were completely natural.
I am happy to note that all the rural heads from the Kashmir Valley have accepted my words.
They went to the village and even made people far away.
A few days back, about 95 percent of the children from Kashmir participated in the examination.
A large number of children participated in the borrowed tests show that our children in Jammu Kashmir have determined to give new heights of development through education for a bright future.
Speaking on the occasion of 8th November, at 8 o'clock, he said that a great move to bring about changes in the country would be initiated.
The more important thing is that it should be implemented with greater importance and I felt that in our normal life there would be a lot of difficulties.
I had said that it would take 50 days to come out of the effect of this decision and it would be such a big decision that you can return to normalcy after 50 days.
500 and 1000 notes, such a large country, such a large number of currency and millions of notes are watching this decision carefully across the globe and all the financial experts are reviewing it.
Twenty-twenty-five crore people of India are looking forward to achieving success with hardships.
There's a question mark in front of the world.
There is a glorious pride for hundred and twenty five crore people of India.
I am confident that this decision will succeed and our country will prove to be like gold.
You are the citizens here, you are somebody, you are the reason why you can't go this way to victory.
Throughout the country, the central government and the state governments, all the components of the local entrepreneurs, one lakh 30 thousand bank branches, millions of bank account holders, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends have been involved in this programme.
Between different kinds of mental tensions, they are very quiet and are considered to be a patriot and an effort to transform it into a great change.
Starting in the morning, working without knowing when the night is over.
All the officers of the bank and the post office are working in such a situation.
If it comes to humanity, it seems they're two feet ahead.
An adult accident took place at Khandwa
Suddenly money was needed
It was very pleased to know that when he took care of an officer from the bank, he went to his house and paid the money for treatment.
Innumerable such stories are known daily by talking to TV, media, newspapers and others.
They are trying to save black money by encouraging the poor and investing their accounts, or doing something else.
But please don't play with the poor's life.
He said, sir, Namaste, my name is Ashish Parre.
Madhya Pradesh, from Tirali village of Taluk in Harda district.
This will encourage people and the economy is very important for nation building.
I'm with the country in this regard.
It is a matter of great pleasure for the withdrawal of your moneylender and a thousand notes.
I would like to thank you with my heart, because no one thought you'd make such a big move when you called your father-in-law Ayenge.
Following the notes of five and a thousand, he taught the black money and the corrupt.
All Indians don't have a good day.
People from different countries of the world have learnt to say that the Tea Peace Scholarship was held.
But I didn't know how to get married in the Chai Pe Church.
I know that a wedding took place on 17th November in Surat with the Chai Pae Church.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea only to those who came to her marriage.
There was no procession, there was no food processing, because the currency was back.
People find good ways in a tragedy.
People are finding their own ways.
You see this change.
The big guys of the relationship, who don't think they're going to ask you, they're not paying the money, and they're supposed to be very much left.
If all municipalities come 50 percent of the land.
But this time, due to this decision on the eighth day, everyone has come out to close their old notes.
Last year, in 47 cities, three thousand three thousand and a half thousand crore people were killed.
It's surprising that you've heard it, and you're surprising that this week, you've got 10,000 crores of rupees.
There will be many such examples that have a direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers have enhanced the economy of this country.
On one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen is fighting with it in the midst of difficulties.
As per Mudra Yojana, there has been a detailed progress in giving loans to them.
Under the Mudra scheme, lakhs and crores of rupees have been given to small people like this because crores of people are doing these small businesses and the business of crores of rupees is faster.
But, according to this decision, it was natural for them to be difficult.
But now our small traders are using technology, using mobile app, using mobile banking, using credit cards, using their own methods and using the beneficiaries.
I want to tell this small businessman that you too have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
You should also download the bank's up on the mobile phone.
Put POS machines to use credit cards.
I'm calling you for that.
I am confident that this technology can be brought in the entire business of your village.
You can't be cheated.
You, I know the youngsters of my country liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know that you play a very important role in taking this thing forward in a profitable manner.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, my best friends.
This is a surprising opportunity to serve mother India. This is an opportunity to take the country to the economic pride.
My young men, can you help me
Your family might not have known the Jews, the parents, the parents, the grandmother.
You know what online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is.
It's normal for you, you use it.
But today the country wants to do a great thing that is a non-violent society.
It's true that a society cannot be hundreds of without notice.
But can't we turn into a slightly noticeable society
If you start a little bit of social creation once, you can't go away without notice.
You know what kind of opportunities are there for digital banking or mobile banking today.
All banks are providing online facility.
All banks in India have mobile apps.
All banks have their own wallets.
Wallette means e-perses.
Several types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, there are Rupee cards near millions of poor families of India.
The use of rubber cards, which were very few, increased by 300 times after the eighth day.
Prepaid cards are available in mobile phones to spend money from the bank like prepaid cards.
Moreover, technology is making it simple without needing a big smart phone.
I have emphasized on simplifying these projects.
All banks try it.
My young friends, there is a big generation that doesn't know.
I know you all are active in this great thing.
I see all the creative messages you give in the Watts App - poems, poems, short stories, cartoons, new imaginations and sports jokes.
But my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this.
Your mobile phone will provide for online expenses.
Not only this, teach how to use this technology for at least 10 families every day for half an hour, two hours and how to download the bank's app, how to spend money in your accounts and how to give it to the customer.
The poor will bless you once you teach people how to use the rubber card.
If you teach the common people all this, they might get rid of all evils.
I don't think that if all the young people of India are involved in this matter then it will take more time.
Within a month, we can present a New India before the world.
You can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 houses every day and connect 10 houses daily.
I invite you, come, not just support, but we can be the army of this change, we can rest with change.
We will take forward this war to save the country from corruption and black money.
That country has done a revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again call upon you to take this initiative forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCCs and NSS to do this together.
Let's take this forward.
We need to do a good service for the country.
You shouldn't lose this chance.
You must have seen that the most renowned artist of this century, Amitabh Swachhta Yojana, is moving forward with great heart.
Cleanliness seems to be spreading in his molecule, so he remembered his father's birth anniversary.
A poem from Harivansh Rai ji, he wrote, "Mann Physics, Rejoicing, Sensitive Life, I am.
The Swachhta Yang flows like blood in the nerves of Shri Amitabh Ji, his son, Mann Ki Baat, Mann Ki Baat.
He has written to me through the poem of Harivansh Rai, a clean body, a clean mind, a clean India, that is why I am.
Harivansh Rai ji is proud.
Thank you so much.
Deepawali is celebrated with great enthusiasm and joy in every corner of India.
India is a country celebrated in any corner of the country for 365 days.
We have seen the courage to finish untimely festivals.
Festival changes have been naturally adopted as per the requirements of time and society.
Do it through the festivals.
These things were linked to the festivals in a very scientific manner by our forefathers.
Today, the world is discussing the environment.
Whether it was trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, there were festivals responsible for everyone.
That is, in our country, the tradition of celebrating the vacations of Brahmanda and science was made.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali, as I have said, this festival also brings about knowledge and understanding.
This Deepawali gives a message to Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamya from darkness to light.
Every part of the house cleans it up.
We need to expand this nature and the tradition.
Deepawali is no longer in the border of India.
Deepawali is celebrated in every country of the world, not in any way.
Several governments and parliaments of the world and the rulers there have been part of the Deepawali festival.
Whether it is eastern countries, whether it is a developed country or a developed country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the festival of Diwali can be seen there.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepawali has been depicted on Twitter.
The Prime Minister of Britain, Shri Narendra Modi, in London, organized a walking sulkar by connecting all the communities with the part of the Deepawali celebrations.
What's that picture...
The Prime Minister of Australia called upon the people of different cities of Australia to participate in the Deepawali celebrations with the best wishes to the Indian society.
Last day the Prime Minister of New ealand had visited.
He said he has to return to attend the Deepawali festival.
This festival of light, Deepawali, indicates that the world is going to be a festival to bring the world from darkness to light.
My parents, call upon the parents to stay close to the elders when they burst up their burials, take care of the evils and avoid risks in the mind.
The Deepavali festival is a little longer in our country.
Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern part of India.
I tell you about Deepawali, even if you talk about Chhath Puja, this is an opportunity for you all to visit Mangalas.
But not expressing gratitude to the countrymen, it is an opportunity to express gratitude.
Our youngsters have sacrificed their lives for our peace and prosperity because of the events that have taken place over the past few months.
Someone in the desert, some in the summit of the Himalayas, some inspire industrialists, some inspire airports.
How many responsibilities are there
Words, birds, leopards, colors, countless imaginations...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
I tell you the truth that because of my smiles, you sleep peacefully because you are enjoying peacefully because you are enjoying the mountains and the gardens of India, and I bow down to you as well as you.
My dear countrymen, Shivani, a sister, who is full of jawans, gave me a message on telephone.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
- Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
Our soldiers are encouraged by the launch of this Deepawali Message to Juvenile.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in Army.
I mean, my whole family is full of soldiers.
Excellent messages are being received by the officers at the border, and everybody in the Army Circle gets encouragement.
Their families and their wives are doing a lot of sacrifices along with the Army Officers and the Solicitors.
In a way, there is a good message to the army, and I wish you the Deepawali wishes.
My dear countrymen, we see soldiers standing not only in the border but in every field of life.
Whether it is natural calamities, the law system has to be dealt with directly, if we have to dare to bring back the wrongdoing youth... our soldiers are working with nationalism in every field of life.
Earlier Sikkim, now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will be the same on November 1.
The name of his village is, Badana.
He was there and there was talk of building a toilet.
Some families have not been able to build toilets due to financial difficulties.
Vikas Thakur has worked and has strengthened the Swachhta Abhiyan by giving thousands of rupees to 57 families from their own pockets.
This has enabled Himachal Pradesh to become Open Defecation Free.
In the far-flung forests of Kerala, there is no way to woo, but a residential village that can only be reached throughout the day.
People don't go there.
Cadet, National Services Scheme's well-known workers and engineering students decided to make their toilets there.
In every state, things are going on fast.
Something I've just said.
In partnership with this great thing, all the citizens of these states are desperately congratulating them for their contribution in the destruction of destructive darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there will be a lot of government schemes and after the first such scheme, the first scheme has to be abandoned.
But generally nobody pays attention to this.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi always guides us.
As per this criteria, you have to decide.
We have to face the awakening hopes of the poor in the country.
Now there are toilets for girls and boys in school.
Twenty-first century and it is no longer possible to make the village still dark.
Therefore, in order to get rid of the darkness of the village, the work of electric delivery is progressing successfully.
Efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to 5 crore families and are moving towards victory.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable traders, milk buyers and those who are embarrassed were in the grip of the robbers.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Accounts are successful schemes for liberation from the robbers.
Directly invest money to Aadhaar-Loote Bank and pay directly to the debitants
This is an opportunity for the common people to get rid of the middle class.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great men of this country made the unity of India a lifetime, and this is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb on one side, the birth anniversary of the vibrant man of unity of the country.
I think he has succeeded in it, and he has joined everyone together.
On the same day, INDIRAGANDY was assassinated and we can say that the nation's destiny is unfortunate.
On the birthday of the great man, who lived for unity, on the birthday of Sardar, you give us a pain in history, the cruelty of Sardars.
Stay away from the thoughts of others, from the works of others, and the country from it.
Sardar Saheb's lifespan started in the struggle for farmers.
He was the farmer's son.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in enhancing the freedom struggle.
Sometimes we hear the name 'Anul'.
Even today, people from outside India are aware of all the invaluable products, but only a few people know that Sardar Saheb's divine vision is the result of the cooperative milk producing unit.
He emphasized this thought in 1942.
We are obviously in front of us in the form of an illustrious and prosperous capital of the farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb.
On this solemn day, on 31st October, we should remember Sardar Saheb anywhere and understand the concept of unity.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Diwali is a glimpse of Kartik Purnima and it is a light festival.
The information and advice given by Guru Nanak Dev is a guide not only to Hindustan but to the entire humanity today.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was that of service, honesty and good for all.
Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo was accompanied by the distortions of casteism and supernaturality.
If we have to move ahead with the mantra called SabkaSath, SabkaVikas, who is better guided than Guru Nanak Dev
Guru Nanak Dev also salutes on the occasion of this lighting festival.
My dear countrymen, once again many my best wishes to you on the occasion of Diwali in the name of the people of the country.
Your dreams and imaginations can be fulfilled in all senses.
Your life is comfortable and peaceful.
English rendering of PMs address to the people of India on the eve of 12th September, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
We lost 18 brave sons of our country in an extremist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector in the past.
I salute all these heroes and pay attention to them.
This loss is not just for those families who lost their husbands, lost their brothers.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
There are many opportunities to talk to the traditional and political leaders.
All parents want all schools and colleges to be fully functioning.
Farmers want their crops and fruits to go to the markets of India.
I mean, financial businesses also want to walk right.
Over the past few days, the business has started working well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace for our problems, our progress and the path of development.
For our future generation, we have to give new heights of vision.
I am confident that we will find peace together for all the problems and will prove to be the right path for the coming generation of Kashmir.
The security of the people of Kashmir is the responsibility of the House.
The government will have to take some steps to carry out the law and order.
I would like to tell the security forces that the use of our power and laws in the near future is for the peaceful and comfortable life of the common people of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who think differently from what we think, put new ideas.
I get the opportunity to know a lot from the social media in the past.
There is an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of people from all corners of India, which encourages the strength of democracy.
Last day, a child named Harshavardhan of class eleven presented a different thought to me.
He wrote, I was so distressed after the horror of Uri, and I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do, like me, a little student can do.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative perspective.
But when the war took place in 1965, we were led by Lal Bahadur Scientist, and there was an excitement throughout the country, jealousy and humiliation of patriotism.
Everyone wanted to walk something, thought of doing something.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried very well to touch this ethnic level of the country.
He inspired the common people of the country to work for the country by giving a mantra called Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan.
Lal Bahadur Scientist showed that there would be other ways to express patriotism between the bomb and the gun.
When Mahatma Gandhi launched a struggle for freedom, when the struggle was strong, when the struggle was needed to move a foot forward, it was a very effective way to return that strength to the society to creative things.
Let the army and the army deliver their responsibility, let the rulers demonstrate their duty, if we are natives and all others, then the country will surely rise to new heights if any creative contribution is made with the spirit of this patriotism.
Dear Countrymen, Mr.
Arthik Narendra Modi wrote to me at the Udai of Udai, the Ataltas that went to Paralympics created history and their performance was the victory of human responsibilities and Human Spirit.
Not only of you, but of all the people of the country, our sportspersons who participated in Paralympics have received an emotional bond.
Perhaps Para Olympics and the achievements of our sportsmen have completely changed human outlook and the spirit of divinity.
I don't forget the words of our successful sister Deepak Malik.
When the medal was received, the sister said, I lost my handicappedness through this medal.
These words are very powerful.
This time, in Para Olympics, 19 lates, including three women from our country participated.
In comparison to other sports, more than physical talent in divine sports, more than the talent of the sportsperson to the sportsperson.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have achieved 4 medals with the greatest achievement so far - two gold and one silver and one shining in Paul Volt and the second gold medal after 12 years.
He was losing his hand because he was electrified.
Think about how big a man would have achieved the second gold medal at the age of thirty-thirteen, after gaining gold medal.
Mariappan got a gold medal in Tangvelu Haizam.
Thanksgiving lost his right in just five years.
Poverty isn't hampered by his determination.
He's not a living man in a big city, but a middle class family.
Whether it leads a life full of hardships or physical hardships, he has achieved a medal for the country in definite manner.
If it's Light Deepamalika, it's got a number of winners rocked.
Varun C.
The bronze medal was won in Haizam.
It is important that in our country, in our society, we have been motivated to look at the divine brothers and sisters living in our neighborhood.
Only a few people know how much performance has been shown in Paralympics this time.
A few days ago, Olympics competitions were held at the same place.
It's a matter of imagination that even the recards of public Olympics have been corrected by divine people.
This time it happened.
In the coming days, India is trying to create an ease of doing business for Para Olympics and its growth.
My dear countrymen, last week, I had a very amazing experience in Navsari, Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people that I was there, people were surprised.
On that day I got the opportunity to publish a book, which included the success stories of the lives of some divyangas.
It was very exciting.
I believe that the Government of India has set up world records on the soil of a newborn.
Within eight hours, about four hundred divine people have been able to make messengers unable to hear.
It's got the Ginns Book of World Recades.
It means that the country has moved 100. 25 billion towards cleanliness.
I was sure what was going on in the right direction and how good the result was and what was happening in a little effort.
Therefore, every common person, whether the government or government or the bus stand, whether it is a railway or a school or a college or a religious institution, whether it is a hospital or a poor village or aged, a poor village or a farmer, everybody contributes towards cleanliness.
Friends from media also played a creative role.
To ensure health, respect for the traditions, especially the mothers and sisters, the speed of defecation in the open space should be over.
Therefore, Open Defecation Free (ODF) has started the creation of an open space defecation destination.
A healthy competition is being held between the States and the States and the districts.
The states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve success in the way of liberation from the habit of external defecation.
Come on, let's move firmly.
I would like to present a programme in front of the young friends, especially those who use technology in recent times.
What is the peace in your city in terms of cleanliness and everyone has the right to know it - Indians have given a number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
If you call this number 1969, you will not only understand the situation of the construction of the toilets but you will also have to apply for the construction of the toilets.
You make it profitable.
Not only this, a Swachhata App has been launched to know about the complaints related to cleanliness and the solutions made to those complaints.
You use it, especially the new generation.
Indians have called upon the corporate world to move forward.
Sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
In the districts, Swachh Bharat can be delivered as Fellows.
In today's era, cleanliness is related to health and cleanliness is also an important model for it.
Pollution should be part of the wealth.
Therefore, we must move towards the West-to-compost with the Cleanliness Mission.
Fertilizer companies have been told to prepare to buy commodities made from waste.
The Ministers and Chief Ministers from all over the country, the mayors and commissioners from the cities are going to have a deep discussion on cleanliness and cleanliness.
What can I do with technology
How can we get jobs through this
There will be discussions on issues like this.
I see new news coming about cleanliness.
Today, I had read in the newspaper that students from Gujarat University went to 107 villages and carried out awareness about the construction of toilets.
They used their authority to create about nine thousand toilets and a team of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh, led to a transmission of cleanliness through a 2800-kilometer journey from Devprayag to Gangasagar.
Every department of the Government of India has prepared a timetable for a year.
I would like to appeal to the people not to interact with their respective areas in the activities of these departments.
Everybody's going on this day.
First of all, 73 cities were served and the cleanliness level was presented to the people.
Now 500 villages have more than one lakh population.
This time we are behind this, there will be a belief in every city that next time we will do a little better.
This is the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It's been two years since Swachh Bharat Mission.
Deepawali's Deepawali will be celebrated this time on 2nd October, Sunday.
Can you join yourself in removing the waste as a fool, two hours and four hours.
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we can determine to do something for the country.
In collaboration with O.M. from 2nd October to 8th October, in many cities, Joe of Giving Week is going to be celebrated.
It is a move to connect the needy with food and clothing.
The centenary year of the Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay begins today.
The universal and universal principle is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the welfare of the person who was standing at the end.
How can the poor get the quality of development
Let the poor people concentrate on how to achieve the development of society, governments and everyone.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year, and I salute the Vice President of India, who is rich in our inspirational heritage and rich in our inherited heritage.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat on the day of Vijayadashmi two years ago.
I have tried myself not to be a programme to showcase the efforts made by the government of Mann Ki Baat.
This Mann Ki Baat should not be the programme of political accusations and accusations.
How is the common man in this country inspire me
That is, Mann Ki Baat is not a 15-20 minutes ago, but a new opportunity for social transformation has emerged.
Anyone's more pleasant than that.
English rendering of PMs address to the people of India on August 20, 2016 at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen, today is the birthday of Hockey Mantri Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
He played a crucial role in winning gold medal in Hockey in the Olympic Games in 1928 and 1932 and 1936.
We've heard the name of Bradman who loved cricket.
He told me about Dhyanchand that His Scorce Gols Lake Rans (He gets the goals as he takes the ransom).
Dhyan Chandji was a living example of Sportsman Spirit and patriotism.
Once in a game in Kolkata, a opponent was killed by Hockeystick on the head of Dhyan Chand.
Then it was 10 minutes left to end the game.
Dhyanchand said that he had three goals within ten minutes and answered with goals.
My dear countrymen, when Mann Ki Baat's time comes, many suggestions are received in MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
Various diversity.
But this time everybody wants me to say something about Rio Olympics.
I am very confident that the common citizens are so close to the Olympics, so waking up and asking the Prime Minister of the country to say something about this.
There is so much knowledge of love and waking up among the citizens of India about the games without cricket.
Our daughters have once again proven that they are not far behind anyone.
It seems that women from all over India have taken a mission to bless India.
The summit at MyGov wrote that we could have performed better than Olympics.
The Prime Minister said, "Greetings to you for the first time in achieving two medals in Advanced Modisar, Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
Our parents still focus on studies and academic issues.
The society still considers Sports to lose time.
It's important to change this thinking.
The spirit of society must be enhanced.
No one can do this better than that.
We can't deny that we can't perform a demonstration like we wanted.
In some ways, our sportspersons have performed well in India, but the best performance shown here has not been expected.
We got only two medals in the medal list.
But if we don't get the medal, we'll see that our players show a good show in different ways.
Behold, Bindraji was the fourth in the shooting, and he lost the medal at a very small distance.
That's what happened in tennis about Sania Mirza and Rohen Bopana and Jodi.
We showed good performance in that altitude.
The first time in 32 years after Usha, simplified the simplicity of the simplicity of the Track and Field File.
It is also a matter of great pleasure that after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached Olympics.
In the last 36 years, first look at the men's hockey to the outstage.
Our team is very strong.
The performance of many sportspersons like Aditya Ashoka, Dattoo Bhoknal and Das was good.
But, my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we do it again, perhaps we'll be disappointed again.
We'll prepare a framework about how we can be better.
The project is to be prepared with far-reaching thinking like 2020, 2024 and 2028.
State governments should create such committees and think of what we can do in the field of sports and what we can do in every state.
States should choose one or two of their own varieties of strength.
I appeal to Sports associations that they should neutrally think.
I appeal to every citizen of India to give me the opinion of anyone who wants it.
We're ready.
Dear Countrymen, September 5 is a teacher day.
I spent a lot of time with students on Teachers Day for many years and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from small kids.
For me, September 5 was a teacher day and a chapter day.
But this time I have to attend the G-20 Summit, so I decided to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
As much as the mother has in her life, she is a teacher.
I have seen teachers who are concerned about more independents than themselves.
They sacrifice their life for their disciples, for their students.
Now, after Rio Olympics, we hear about Pulela Gopichand all around.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand, his penance and his dedication to Sports and his way of happiness in the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our lives.
The former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnan Ji and the nation is celebrating this day as a teacher.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
Even today, he seems to teach me in classroom.
I'll tell you he's giving me the Carspondence course.
It will be amazing to see his handicrafts in this nineteenth year of age.
Because my letter is very bad, I feel very glorious to see somebody's good character.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh festival is coming closer.
Ganesh Changes... let not our country, our society, our family and everybody interrupt their lives.
The festival of Janakanesh was inaugurated by the World Tilak, which made this religious festival an opportunity to wake up the country.
Even today, the festival of Ganesh is going on not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India.
Every young man is making a lot of preparations for this festival and will be very excited.
Some people are still trying to justify what the world's genius has done.
There are discussions on public issues, articles, flowers and festivals.
In its views, the issues touching the society are presented in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education is going on through the Ganesh festival.
The world-wide Tilak gave inspiration that Swaraj was our birthright.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of society.
Festival provides a new life to the lives of persons and society.
Life is impossible without the festival, but it has to be made according to the time.
This time many people have written specially to me about Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Don't use Ganesh Ji made of soil in the village pond.
The statues made of the Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment.
He's very painful, too.
I would also like to appeal to you that we can make statues of Ganesh and Durga Devi and return to our ancient heritage.
Ganesh is a madman.
Therefore, we shouldn't make Ganesh, who makes a break-up.
I don't know how much you're going to accept this thing, but it's not me, but many say it.
Many such institutions are very much instrumental in creating a soil smell.
An environment friendly Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
If the lake is made by the river's brother, it will melt again, it will not cause serious damage to the environment.
Ganesh Chaturthi greets you all.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Madar Teresa will be declared sacred on 4th September.
Madar Teresa used to serve the poor people of India throughout his life.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud that Madar Teresa, who served the poor for the entire life, is getting the holy status.
On the 4th of September, the Government of India is also taking up an official delegation under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj for 125 crore Indians.
Anything we can learn from the saints, the sages, the men and the great men.
We'll win something, learn something, do something good.
My dear countrymen, how much change takes place when development is a birthplace.
People's power is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people to clean the Ganga for the construction of Ganga with the help of 5 State Governments.
This month, a meeting of the village heads on the banks of the Ganges was called in Allahabad.
I congratulate the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the Government of India and the Ministers for bringing about this idea.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers and the five states in the name of the great Kalvayp for cleaning the Ganga with the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my heart and those people who have created these ideas are particularly respected in my heart.
On 15th July, more than one and a half lakh students in more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh wrote letters to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
They told their parents that they wanted toilets in their homes.
So they asked, some people wrote that they didn't celebrate their birthday this year, but it was sure to make toilets.
This is inspiring us.
A sixteen-year-old girl from Kopal district of Karnataka, has made her swearing-in against her family.
The family wasn't financially able.
The kid was stubborn.
The village chief, Mohammed Shafi, who has been making a swearing-in for slaughterhouses, made a toilet within a week.
The girl's strength and the village chief like Mohammad Shafi are greetings.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is a dream of every Indian.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have made it their target.
Web site will get information about this.
The Short Films will be awarded to the winners on the Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October.
I want TV channels to tell you that you are also inviting them to make films like this and make competitions.
Effectivity will strengthen pollution and new liquidity will be available, new ways will be known, new inspiration will be...
All this will be done through the collaboration of people and ordinary artists, whether they need a big studio or a big camera to make films.
Many people think that the President should inaugurate a radio channel.
But it's not a normal radio channel, it's a big step.
We have Bangladesh around us.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still in the same cultural heritage.
Akashvani Mythri and Bangladesh Bethar are here where they will share their programmes and the Bangla-speaking people from both sides will enjoy the activities of Akashvani.
Akashvani's contribution to creating personal relations is very big.
The President inaugurated this.
I thank the Bangladesh for collaborating with us in this regard.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to the sky.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job as the Prime Minister, but I am also a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart.
Such imaginative events inspire new energy and inspire people of India to do something.
Millions and millions of mothers of India who have always been able to help others with their own sufferings.
My dear countrymen, we were suffering due to loss last year but due to continuous rain this month, there was a lot of trouble.
There was frequent flood in some parts of the country.
State governments, central governments, local autonomy institutions, social institutions and citizens have tried a lot to do whatever they can.
But, during the news of floods, some other news had to be remembered.
What is the strength of unity and how great will it bring together will be reminiscent of this year's August.
The GST Act was simultaneously passed by nearly 90 parties across the country and all the parties in the Parliament, which are holding a strong political dilemma in August 2016.
Its credit is for all the parties.
It is an example that if all the parties come together and walk in one direction, how big it can be.
Similarly, all the political parties in the country spoke together about the events in Kashmir and the situation there.
I believe in the strength of hundred and twenty five crore people.
Today morning, I had the opportunity to spend with a few young people from Delhi.
In the coming days, I am confident that all the young people of the country will grow in the colors of the zeal of Olympics sports.
The whole world will drown in the games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our players anywhere.
I will surely send messages to the sportspersons on the site of Narendra Modi App.
Come together, let us try to enhance the dignity and self-respect of all our players and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion, when I talk to you about Rio Olympics, I would like to hear a poem from a student of the Punjab University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, who is interested in poetry.
There will be many other such poems, they will have written such poems, some will write again, some will have poetry.
I want to share the poems that Suraj has sent me.
The young man, Shriman Ankit Karke, remembered me on the corresponding day of the last year of the former President Abdul Kalam.
Therefore, Shri Angli has been inspired to write what steps your government has taken to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The next century will be guided by technology.
If someone tried to capture it, it would appear in a new dress at a distance, and if we want to enhance technology, we should move ahead.
Therefore, we can take research and innovation into the vital elements of technology.
Innovation, training, entrepreneurship etc.
If we arrange the second generation of innovation, our children will join it.
Therefore, the Government of India started Atal Tinkering Abs.
10 lakh and another 10 lakh rupees will be provided for the next 5 years.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly related to innovation.
When we are able to build the sufficient incubation centres, we can create a system to bring it in a systematic manner for start-ups for innovation.
Building of new incubation centres and innovation of old people is also important.
We have to face many problems in everyday life.
Antibiotics are eaten because the heart wants to get rid of the disease soon .
You'll get rid of it for a while, but you have to stop taking antibiotics without taking advice from the doctors.
We don't eat antibiotic until the doctor writes.
We don't walk through such bullshit.
And the war will extend years for new medicines and scientific research.
Until then these diseases will continue to create new problems.
Therefore, we need to be always aware of this.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Take 15 pills, the doctor will tell you to eat it in 5 days.
Just take the pills and complete the course, as the doctor suggests.
By eating more than necessary medicines it can be beneficial for the bacteria .
Therefore, the number of pills that the doctor intends to follow it is a big deal.
It's called antibiotic resistance in medical terms.
Therefore, it is necessary to follow the rules that they should use as antibiotics.
Our government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance.
You might have seen a red glass on the other side of the antibiotic medicines sold today.
My request is that you take special care of it.
I want to add another thing to health.
I am worried about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
Deficiency of pregnancy and subsequent blood, reproductive infections, high blood pressure, which can not be said to destroy their lives.
In view of this, the Government of India has implemented a new scheme for the last few months, namely, Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Yojana.
Under this scheme, on the 9th of every month, every pregnant woman gets free check up at government health centres.
I specially appeal to genecologists that this service cannot be provided freely for poor mothers on one day in a month i. e.
I'm sure you'll be part of it.
My dear countrymen, today the world is distressed about climate change, global warmth and environment.
Social discussions are going on in the country and the world.
India has been focusing on this for centuries.
Lord Krishna discusses trees in the battlefield of Kurukshetra.
Shukracharyanayi also says that there is no medicinal herb for the sake of waste.
And whoever donates the tree grows in the world like his own children.
Therefore, their parents want to plant good trees and protect them like children.
Be it Geetha, Shukracharyanayati or Ashishana Parvati of Mahabharata, there are some who live in these ideals in today's generation.
Just a few days ago, I took care of a daughter from Pune, Sonal, a desert.
It touched my mind.
The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the tree is fulfiling the responsibility of the children in the world and Sonal is taking an effort to fulfil the desires of the society, not only his parents but also his parents.
Kisan Ghandu Marty Mahatra, a village named Narayanpur in Kejunar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, has done a very encouraging marriage of his patriarch Sonal.
I saw the picture in the social media.
I am amazed that only the plants were visible.
This scene, which touches the heart, was in the picture.
Sonal is a graduate, this idea is hers.
You can see how great nature has shown love for those who have come to the wedding.
In another way, Sonal's marriage became an inheritance of natural love and I extend my best wishes to Sonal and Mr.
This tree can be transformed into a natural reproductive.
I am told that the Government of Maharashtra has decided to plant about 1. 5 billion trees across the state on 1st July this year and 3 crore trees have been planted next year.
25 lakh plantations in Rajasthan is not undesirable.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan know how hard it is.
By 2029, Andhra Pradesh has decided to increase its greenery by 50 percent.
Gujarat also has a bright tradition of the jungle festival.
This year, several names like Gujarat Mau forest, Ekta Wild and Martyr Jungle have been made to plant crores of trees by presenting them to the Wildlife Festival.
But for me, South African travel was a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela when they remember South Africa.
On hearing the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoeni Settlement, which is known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I was fortunate to travel from Peter Maritburg station on a train traveled by Mahatma Gandhi and this was the case that a seed was made to make Mohandas a Mahatma Gandhi.
I want to say that this time I got the opportunity to meet many great people who have honoured their youth and equal opportunity in the society.
He fought with Nelson Mandela with his shoulder and lived in prisons for 20-22 years.
I am fortunate to see the greats of Mr. Ahmad Katha, close friend of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Lalu Cheba, Mr. George Besos and Rani Casserils.
Even after such a great confusion, they couldn't see the feelings of getting their faces, accepting and becoming.
The symptoms of Kartiv Philosophy i. e.
There is no mantra composed by the government for any society equal opportunity.
Their thinking is very natural.
They told me about something... architecture from Bangalore.
A woman froda blew up 11 lakhs in a chitmail and then I read the news they committed suicide.
As a woman, I'm sorry about her family.
I want to know what you say about such a chit-frodmail.
Within a few minutes, I realized that he had lost everything.
Sometimes you might be misunderstood.
They're so nice that they're narrated.
But I had a very pleasant experience here.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The boys and girls were very excited.
And they came with a big alba, and they had a joy on their faces.
Artificial paintings were conducted at the station.
Not only this, plastic bottles and oil utensils found in the midst of pulses in the rural areas, they have been constructed by planting soil and planting the Vertical Garden.
And on one side of the railway station, this Vertical Garden has been built in plastic bottles and has given it a new feeling.
My dear countrymen, the time of festivals has come in our country over the years.
Think that the sister will give a gift that protects her life, not only will she cook in our house.
There will be a woman cleaning in our house, she will be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the right meaning of the defence.
My dear countrymen, many of us are born in the era of independence.
I am the first Prime Minister to be born in the post-independence period.
Let the whole country blossom in the spirit of freedom fighters and let us reflect the devotion of freedom once again.
Let's all create this environment.
And the Independence Day celebrations should be a programme of the people of the country, without a government programme.
We have to be our own festival like Deepakali.
I would like you to do some good things related to it, including inspiration from patriotism.
Its pictures must be sent to the Narendra Modi App.
Create an environment in the country.
You would like to present that thing in your mind from the Red Fort with so strongness.
As your delegate, as your delegate, as your chief servant, if I want to say these things from the Red Fort, I am inviting you.
I don't want to be the Prime Minister's words from the Red Fort.
And nowadays, technology platforms are easier for you to reach me easily.
As Mann Ki Baat was presented in local languages at 8 o'clock in the evening, I am passing through the sky.
Many of these suggestions help in the functioning of my government.
Maybe it's a week to start the rainy season, so we're also concerned.
In almost most of the regions of the country, there is a severe heat of summer.
Climate change enhances such problems.
The width of the forest area was reduced and the trees were cut off.
In a way, man destroys nature and destroys himself.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions on the environment around the world.
In the past, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu Kashmir and the Himalayan Ghats have become volcanoous.
I got the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha, in the last few days.
Every country listened carefully.
In general, there has been no such micro-syllabus regarding how much the central government has sanctioned and how much it has been spent.
The fact that in many areas, water conservation, environment, dry deployment, animal conservation for AII, and in a way, showcases the best practices for the entire country.
I told NITI Aayog that the best examples of this should be adopted and implemented in other states.
Some states, especially Andhra and Gujarat, have fully benefited technology.
Now I want to carry out the successful tests of the states through NITI Aayog in other areas.
In such a situation, popularity is a major component of victory.
I believe that if there is a comprehensive planning, the systems can be finished within a period of time using appropriate technology.
Water conservation is also important.
Every year, their target is to include more than two and three lakh hectares of land in micro irrigation.
Chhattisgarh has been implemented by Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan.
Nearly 22,000 ponds were included in the Belram Talab Yojana in Madhya Pradesh, which is not a small number.
They were aimed at water conservation, and in some states, schemes have been implemented to build small soils and protect water from 10 to 20 kms.
It's a good experience.
I want to say that one drop of rain from June, July, August and September does not even lose water.
Now we have to think of what should be the place for water conservation.
God has provided water according to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
We are unaware of seeing a lot of water and when the rainy season is over, we're not getting water and how long it can be.
In the past, the media had mentioned about the problems of water supply.
I am confident that the media can provide water conservation guidance and extend its activities and the media will also be partnered in the ways to solve water conservation.
I'll invite them to it.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
Make a transparent India.
Our plans should be taken to every corner of India without any compromise.
We need to make small changes in our old minds.
But today the situation has changed completely.
The world looks like a cashless society.
Electronic technology can provide money from all over the world and handle it.
When we get together, we're gonna die as a moneylender.
Perhaps you might have seen that RPA CARD has been given with Jan Dhan account.
In the days to come, this card can be used in Credit Debit Cards.
There is no need to take money from the pocket, oil or anything.
That is, the Bank on Mobile-Niversal Payment Interface Banking Transaction (PII) will transform systems for ever.
Money Transaction Payments will be very easier through your mobile phone.
If it is easier, then RPA CARDs don't always have to walk together.
Moreover, post offices have also been made active for banking services.
The illegal transactions will last forever.
The effect of black money will be great.
So, my countrymen, I want to start this.
Once we start, we can move easily.
Twenty-twelve years ago, we'd have thought that our mobile would have been in our hands.
That's how we cannot become a society.
It would have been better if it wasn't done without a scream.
My dear countrymen, when the Olympics competition or the game starts, we shake our heads, we shall be far behind the gold medal.
If you get the silver.
Everyone should encourage self-determination and enthusiasm in their way to promote our sportspersons to participate in the Rio Olympics.
In the last week, we all were concerned about what will be the results of the elections, especially what would be the results in Assam.
Encourage the sportspersons, encourage our sportspersons and give them greater self-confidence and strength.
Without immersing everybody in the melting of the consumption of water, India must jump its sea before the world with the Sportsman Spirit.
Throughout the year, the results of the students who have been tested in 10th and 12th classes are coming together.
I want to tell those who don't succeed. There's too much to do in life.
A Mr. serious in Madhya Pradesh...
Gamble Patel, he presented his greatest trouble before me.
33 per cent in the market.
Everyone told me that my 90 percent lost in the shortfall of 4 marks.
I don't know what I felt like weighing in my mind.
I read your letter carefully.
I think, perhaps this pain is not yours.
Like you, there are millions and millions of students, because such an environment is conserved.
By finding satisfaction in all things, we can lead the society towards the direction of peace and satisfaction.
Your relatives, colleagues and friends are 89.
I am happy to note that this is almost the same thing.
He says people around me don't accept our results.
If it was a little better - I didn't remember the whole poem, but a poet who read me a long time ago, wrote a picture of pain in the canvas of life.
Some say it would be better if it was yellow instead of blue.
Some people said it would have been better if they were there instead of putting this line here.
Well, it would have been better if one or two of them had a picture of my pain.
Everyone was talking about the dump.
Thousands of students like you are like this.
You are capable of fulfilling the needs of the people.
I want to tell you so much, you don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everyone shows the need.
But stand firm on your own and try to fill a little more beautifully.
But if we are not satisfied with the achievement, then the new goal will never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of victory is the basis of great success.
The success of success does not result in the despair of satisfaction.
It happens everywhere in life.
You might have heard about the word 'Santur'.
There was a time when the Santoor Vehicle was associated with folk music in Kashmir valley.
But a man named Pandit Shiv Kumar put it in the form of a great drum instrument in the world.
Shehnai- Our music was in a very limited territory around the world.
Most of the kings had their doors in the darbars.
But when Ustad was handed over to Bismilakhan Shehna, it became a world-class drum.
It is true that the cost is very less to avoid getting sick but on occurrence of disease the cost of recovering health is very high .
If anyone can help the poor, it's only for cleanliness.
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
There is a special message from Yoga all over the world and it has respect and belief.
Yoga provides strength to lead a balanced life to the world suffering from stress.
Every person has to spend 20-25 minutes or 30 minutes in his lifestyle.
For this, we are inspired on 21st June, Yoga Day.
Sometimes a social intensity causes changes in the life of the person.
I hope you'll take your precautions anywhere on June 21.
Repeat it in your nearby areas, in your city, in your villages, in your schools, in your institutions, even in your office.
Start a month from now, and look, you'll be part of it on June 21.
I am going to attend the event of Chandigarh this time.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with you through this programme called Mann Ki Baat.
I gave you a mobile number a long time ago, in which you could hear Mann Ki Baat by doing mid-could.
But it's simple.
You just need only four times to hear Mann Ki Baat.
If you do Miss Collection in this number in 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat anywhere anywhere.
My dear countrymen, once again my greetings to you all.
Don't forget about the water I said.
Mann Ki Baat, July, 2019
Mann Ki Baat is a time when I and you are waiting.
This time too many letters, commandants, phone calls, many stories, instructions and inspirations...
People have seen discussions about the books written about science, technology, new inventions, history, culture, business, lifestyle etc.
People called upon me to discuss several other books.
But I don't have to tell you that I can't remove time to read a lot of books.
Let us start a permanent book corner at the Narendra Modi App, and we can write and discuss it when we read a new book.
You can suggest a name for this book corner.
I want this book to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Many experts have tried their best in water conservation.
People share information about traditional methods.
For example, the enthusiasm shown by the rural people in the village of Ara Karam in Ormanji Block, a few days from Ranchi, Jharkhand, has become an example for everyone.
The beautiful state of north-eastern India has become a Meghalaya-owned water source.
I congratulate the government there.
A lot of water is required in Haryana but the farmers are emphasizing the need for non-lasting farming.
I especially congratulate the Government of Haryana for discussing with the farmers, removing them from traditional farming and inspiring them to make some water needed farming.
It's time for the festivals.
Festivals are also held during the festivals.
These fairs will not be used for water conservation.
People from all sections of society come to the fairs.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be delivered very well, showcasing, street drains, and the message of water conservation along with the festival can be very unsuccessful.
Friends, Something in life is encouraging us.
Especially the achievements of children and their work gives us new energy.
So I want to talk about some children.
They are from Nidhi Bypa, Monish Joshi, Devamshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Priti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aarnaitesh Ganguly, Haritik Alamda.
I'm telling you about them, your heart will be proud and zealous.
We all know that the word Cancer is the most scary thing in the world.
After winning the game, he won the medal and became a champion.
But it was a rare opportunity for them to become champions before participating in the competition.
And the champions of life struggle.
This month, Wald Children's Winners Games walked in Moscow.
I mean, those who fought with cancer in their lives participated in the competitions like shooting, swimming, swimming and football.
All these champions of our country have achieved a medal in the tournament.
Some of these sportspersons won medals in more than one variety.
Dear countrymen, you must have been proud of the success of India in the space beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjay Haripura, Calcutta and Mahendra Kumar Daga from Jodhpur, Rajasthan and P.
In terms of space, 2019 is a good year for India.
Our scientists launched A Sat in the month of March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement.
On July 22, the country was proud to move from Chandrayaan 2 to the atmosphere from Sriharikota.
The photographs of Chandrayaan 2 filled the people with pride, enthusiasm and satisfaction.
Chandrayaan 2 mission is unique in many ways.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But we should always remember that we have the ability to survive it.
I am confident that Chandrayaan will inspire the youth of 2nd country to turn to the world of science and research.
Science is essentially opening the path of development.
We are desperately waiting for the moment Lander Vikram and Rover Pragyan are laundered on the surface of the moon.
Today through Mann Ki Ba, I would like to inform the students of the country about a very attractive competition to the youth.
The country's youth wants to invite the youth of the country to a quiz competition, the questions related to space, the science mission and science technologies of India will be a matter of great concern.
I call upon young friends and students to attend this issue and make it attractive and joyful and unforgettable through your partnership.
I specially appeal to the schools, the parents, the enthusiastic princes and the teachers to try their best to win their schools.
Encourage all the schools to participate in it.
This will be a history of their lives for the students who are successful.
But it has to be included in the problem, get the maximum mark and succeed.
Inspire more friends.
Dear Friends, you're gonna notice one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat Swachhta Abhiyan has increased from time to time.
When they performed their skills from the walls of Over Bridges and Schools to the halls, people and people joined them, it became a big movement.
You must have seen how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a big role in this regard.
It is important for us to develop the culture that creates wealth from waste in our society.
In a way, we have to move towards a thing that gives gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, last day, I read a very attractive word on MyGov.
The commander belonged to Brother Mohammad Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He writes: It is a pleasure to hear Mann Ki Baat program.
I participated actively in organizing the Back-to-Village for Community Mobility programme in my state, Jammu Kashmir.
The program was organized in June.
I suggest that such programmes take place every three months.
Besides, arrangements should be made to monitor the program online.
This programme shows how inspired the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
The programme was attended by a large number of office bearers, who had not seen the villagers, had come to their homes for a week to understand the hurdles in development.
How to increase the income of the people.
He said that the services of the authorities have an impact on the lives of the common man, and the villagers have expressed their concerns by opening their hearts.
Several issues including literacy, male and female ratio, health, pollution free, water conservation, electricity, water, education of girls and problems of elder citizens have also been discussed.
Friends, this programme was not a function of the government that the officer travelled throughout the day and returned to the village, but this time the authorities spent two days in the Panchayat, so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added many things to make this program more attractive.
Khelo India led the sports competition for children.
It also distributed Sports Kitts, National Yojana's job cards, PATIC species and list certifications.
Such programmes and the people's participation in these programmes would like the rule of our brother-in-law Saddam in Kashmir, which shows that the strength of progress is more than the strength of the bomb and the gun.
It is obvious that those who want to express their hatred on the path of development and want to create a hurdle, they cannot achieve their negative goal.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandre, a Jewish priest, said in his poem about the glory of the month of Shravan.
In this context, he said that Hodige Madige Agydu Agyedu is a land that has a different connection between the rains and the water flows, and the earth is blossoming in its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages throughout the country celebrate their ways in the month of their year.
In this season, when we look at the climate, the Earth feels green.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, many fast fast and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagapanchami.
During this period, the Raksha Bandhan Festival is a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
This time more than 4 years in the Amarnath Yatra, more than a few devotees participated in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Since 1st July, more than three hundred pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days of this journey in 2015, more people participated in just 28 days this time.
I congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their teachings for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
People coming back from the journey change the spirit of the people of the state and the spirit of independence.
They're all very helpful to travel in the future.
On the other hand, it is a heavy rainy season in many parts of the country.
My dear countrymen, it is very difficult to decide where to start Mann Ki Baat.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
Many times it seems that India is a country of economic humidity through festivals.
Festivals change as an opportunity for economic smoothness to the poorest of the society.
You know I'm using technology well, and that's why I get more information.
Ganesh V.
Savesh Warkar wrote to me that this season is a tourism season.
Many national and foreign tourists are becoming tourists.
People celebrate Christmas holidays.
Sometimes we listen to disappointing things from different corners of the country.
This is the strength of the country that millions of people do some kind of good in their own ways like 48.
There are new opportunities for education and employment.
When the whole world was attracted by Yoga and celebrated International Yoga Day, we were proud of India's strength.
This imagination is reflected when we see the vastness of India.
Cleanliness is heard in the houses today.
The participation of the people continues to increase.
That's also a service.
I've made little efforts in my way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear youngsters, on 15th August this year, I had started a first discussion on Start-Up India and Stand-Up India at the Red Fort.
This was discussed in the Government Departments.
Can India become a start-up capital
We have been discussing whether we can start new start-ups and new inventions, whether it is in the manufacturing sector, whether it is in the service sector or in the agricultural cleaning.
If you think so, it's wrong.
The youngsters from any corner of India should give them opportunity.
Start-up India and Stand-up India should not be reduced to just a few cities.
This will spread to every corner of India.
I urge the State Governments to expand this.
On 16th January, I will discuss this with you.
I'll welcome your instructions.
My dear youngsters, 12 January is Swami Vivekananda's Jayanti.
There are millions of people like me who are inspiring from Swami Vivekananda.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is celebrating 12th January as National Youth Festival.
This year, it is celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th to 16th January.
A small India is going to be created there - a young India.
In a way, the sound of dreams can be seen.
The power of the decisions can be seen.
Can you share your suggestions on this Youth Festival
I believe that this is the result of the work done by you people.
Dilip ji, thank you for a thousand.
Are you a man working in this field
So you can understand, you have to face many problems
Sometimes Vikalangar, sometimes civilians, sometimes differently abled.
Every word has its own significance.
This year the Government of India has started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I expect you to take this.
Have we started singing Sugamya Bharat
This will enhance all kinds of infrastructure and facilitate them.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, rumps, parking, lifts, braille lips, they need to make it easier.
Technologies are needed, systems are needed.
It's been tried and the people's people are getting it.
People like it.
Don't move the files before it.
In fact, the plans are for the common people and the poor.
In the past, the Government of India has taken an explanation on how to benefit the right rights of the schemes.
The gas cylinders are subsidized in our country.
It wasn't checked whether the numbers were properly maintained.
Therefore, the government has made some changes in this.
The mission is to directly transform the beneficiary bank account through Jan Dhan Account through the Benefit Transfer Scheme to the beneficiaries of the world.
I am confident that the world's largest successful director Benefit Transfer Scheme has secured its rank in the Guinness Book of World Records.
On the one hand, Aadhaar Card Campaign, on the other hand, Jan Dhan Accounts are opening, and the central governments are combining the list of beneficiaries and connecting them with bank accounts through Aadhaar.
Now the money is directly deposited in the accounts of the workers at several places.
There were complaints about students' scholarship and efforts have been made to solve it.
About 40 crore rupees have been directly transferred to the accounts of beneficiaries through various schemes.
About thirty-five to forty projects have been included in the direct benefit transfer scheme.
My dear Indians, 26th January is the golden moment of the Republic of India.
In the Parliament, two days have been shifted to a special discussion on the Constitution.
It was a good experience.
We are aware of most of the debts during the election, and we are convinced by advertising and wall writing that vote is our duty.
Why don't we talk about the works in everyday life like the election time
On 26th January, at the time of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the country will not hold discussions on the basis of functions of schools, colleges, colleges, villages, cities and organizations
If 125 crore people moved one after another and fulfilled their commitment then it would be an unforgettable history.
Let's start the discussions.
You can get the chance to go anywhere.
Festivals have great importance in social life.
There is regular news of natural calamities from every corner of the world.
We've never imagined or imagined these threats.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
The central government is also working with them.
But the need for changes is to be considered when such problems are seen in the environment.
That's a good start.
Today, I received a phone call from Jalandhar in Punjab, Luckwindar Singh, who was speaking from the Jalandhar district of Punjab.
"I am very happy to hear your question.
The main reason for my happiness is that you make organic farming.
Not only that, with biodiversity, you understand the problems of farmers.
But it's not right to think that it happens only in Punjab and Haryana.
The nature of all Indians is that we follow the way we burn the ruins of traditional crops.
We didn't have any sense of this loss.
Everyone does it, we do it.
Secondly, I didn't even train how to do this.
But your concern is correct.
But this isn't true.
The ruins of the crop are worthy.
Secondly, the surface of the Earth is driven by the fire.
We can't live even if the heart is strong.
Similarly, if the ruins of the fire burn, the ruins are burnt not only by the earth's mother's skin.
Animal food can also be used, which saves our soil.
Not only that, look at the size from the same land, it gives double profits.
Once I got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who have made valuable farming.
They shared a nice experience.
Earlier, they used to cultivate potato and they had to spend a hectare of five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand to remove the ruins of potato.
Until the guys bring them to the tracker, the ruins of that sword will remain the same.
But some farmers have dumped these ruins of palm up to 6-8 inches on the ground.
Last time I discussed organ donation in Mann Ki Baat.
Helpline of 'Chhathcha' was also told for organ donation.
Several prominent personalities including film producer Ravin Tandon participated in this.
You can save many lives worth a donation.
In a way, organ donation gives immunity.
When the organ transforms from one body to another, that organ gets a new life and that life gets a new life.
What's more important than that
The National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation (Organ Transplantation) for donating organs to patients waiting for transplantation of organs began on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awakening in every system and in the right sense the needy will get the best support.
Everyone has to move forward for this.
As I have already suggested, I am moving on the 3rd of December as International Diplomacy Day.
Physically and mentally different, incomparable will and courage are the owners.
They're sorry when they're ridiculed.
We'll start crying when there's a bit of trouble.
When we think they're alive, our pain looks so slight.
How do they live
Their determination towards life and their zeal to transform the problems into capabilities is praiseworthy.
Today, I want to tell you about Javed Ahmad.
He's 40, 42 years old.
The terrorists shot him in Kashmir in 1996.
Though he was a victim of the terrorists' gun, he was surprised to escape.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed and one part of the intestine was lost.
The spinal cord was seriously damaged.
He lost his ability to live in his own leg, but he didn't give up.
The wound of terrorism didn't hit him.
How to improve the connectivity mechanisms for physically challenged persons, how to create systems in public places and government offices.
Whether Javed's life is enough to inspire every corner of India
I specially remember the life of Javed Ahmad, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
Because of lack of time, I am just talking about Javed, but inspiring lamps are emerging in every corner of India.
Our country is too big.
There are many things that are dependent on the government.
More than one experience transforms our perspective of government systems throughout the life.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
How many millions can work around us like this.
If you see the sick with loved ones, what is more happy than that
Are they themselves partners in the sorrows of society
I congratulate all the ASHA workers of this kind of work in the name of 'Jamunamani'.
Besides making 'e' books more discussed, some youngsters should tell the students of eight or nine or ten classes of nearby schools, what is happening here and there.
And, in fact, you are becoming a good teacher of a society.
I welcome you to the nation building programmes.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change.
The friend, who led me to share this comfortable experience, sent me a snake to know and see it.
But if they're doing something, some other educationists wouldn't have thought of it.
They have been working with solar energy to provide light to the poor people in their respective areas.
They fought against the darkness and enabled his name.
They constructed a platform of Rantal, which was lighted by solar energy through a women's association.
They are giving rent to the local residents for just a hundred rupees per month.
We know what the world's big people do about climate change.
Thank you very much for your News.
But the beginning is nice.
In a very short span of time, 66 lakh people have been able to get Rs 42,000 crore (Rs 42,000 crore) through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Whether it is a labourer, a journalist or a merchant, any person who is employed will get the real benefit.
Abhishek shared his happiness.
There's a lot of things in front of me.
Secondly, from Mumbai, Shailesh is from Bhosle.
8 lakh (Rs. 8.
I used to say during our Swachh Bharat programme that new entrepreneurship will come into effect through that programme.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in bringing it to work.
But nobody knows about this scheme.
How should the programme be built
How can Logo be
But I'm expecting more suggestions.
There is a need for a number of basic projects.
It will also provide a certificate to those who are active.
And other gifts have also been announced.
My dear brothers, the winter months have started.
Make a good atmosphere in the family and make a festival and join everyone in the exercise.
Through the exercises, you will be able to know how much the brilliantness of chaitya is.
The whole day's body will be more prolonged.
If it's a good season, it's a good nature.
My dear countrymen, you once again offer good wishes.
Jai Hind.
On 3rd October last year, I had the privilege to present Mann Ki Baat.
One year through Mann Ki Ba.
Our ancestors used to say, "Jana Janardan" is the voice of the people.
From my experiences of the Mann Ki Baat program, it can be said that our ancestors have great strength and truth in this thought because I realized it.
Several topics have started reaching the government from the bottom.
And, it is true that information from the bottom to the top to the bottom of the guidance is the basic principle of governance.
Did anyone ever think that 'Mann Ki Baat' would be the source of information
But it happened.
And likewise, Mann Ki Baat made an opportunity to showcase the strength of the society.
I told you one day selfie with a dugter and the whole world was surprised.
It was a silent revolution.
Millions of pictures have been sent from every corner of India.
Perhaps the tourism departments of the Indian government or the state government have not thought that we have so much wealth.
Mann Ki Baat became a platform for the government and people took the job without any money for the government.
I am happy to note about Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme before October last year.
When I talked about Gandhi Jayanti, I called upon the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October and encouraged the entire nation to celebrate Khadi products.
There was a time when it was called Khadi for the nation.
Can't you call it Khadi for fashion according to the change of time
I wanted people to buy you and do something.
After that, I would like to say that Khadi was almost doubled.
This wasn't done by government advertisements.
This is not the achievement spent by millions and millions.
It's an experience of manpower, a victory.
Once in Mann Ki Baat, I said, the poor smokes in his house, the children cry.
They need LPG cylinders, right
Today I can be happy to say that 30 lakh families of our country have left the subsidy of LPG.
I saw a retired school teacher in the channel standing in the queue to stop the widowed woman subsidies.
The middle class, the lower ones are hard to leave the subsidies.
But those people have left the subsidies.
It's silent, isn't it
We can't see the people's power in this.
Our government has to incorporate the lesson that there is a very strong, powerful and determined society outside the rock.
What else do you want to please
I was thinking about doing a new experiment this time in Mann Ki Baat.
There will be no area where people don't phone calls.
It's a pleasant feeling.
People of all ages have sent a message.
I wanted to hear some messages myself, and I liked it.
My team is taking steps for the rest.
The entire department of the government will surely consider your instructions.
But one thing surprised me and enjoyed me.
Maybe we're negative.
But my experience is forgotten.
These fifty thousand people have spoken their way.
How creatively the common people of the country think about it, how rich it is for the country
Perhaps only one or two phone calls can be seen from serious complaints.
More than 90 per cent was a pleasure to reflect a variety of energy.
They must have heard radio.
Pavan Acharya sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, is that Please request the people of India to use maximum software for Deepawali through Mann Ki Baat this year.
It will benefit the environment and create opportunities for thousands of soil utensils manufacturing brothers to get jobs.
I am confident that your thoughts like Pavan Acharya will reach and spread across the coast of India.
I would like to tell the countrymen that if we implemented the words of Pavan Acharya in the coming festivals, then its fight will be lighted in their homes, but the light will spread in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the third day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
With our army protecting the sea-corporation.
In 1965, the war with Pakistan ended 50 years.
In the name of this, a 'Shauryanjali' exhibition was organized at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to create history, it is necessary to know and understand the microscopic values of history.
History connects us with our roots.
If the relationship with history is lost, the possibility of creation of history can also be finished.
Don't look like me.
I'm back in two and a half hours.
That kid is right.
And I've heard criticisms like what happened.
I don't think it's a bad thing, I've been discussing India's cleanliness even in the best parliament that I see in it.
On the other hand, the Parliament, on the other hand, on the other hand, a boy in this country, on the other hand, both speak about cleanliness and what is the greatest fortune of one country
This revolution of ideas creates an atmosphere of hatred towards evils and is awakening about cleanliness.
It will force the governments to work.
We must take this task for the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi said
If there is a time to choose one of these things for cleanliness and freedom, then I will first choose cleanliness and then become free.
Gandhiji gave more importance to cleanliness than freedom.
Gulshan Arora Mygov from Delhi.
I want to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men always inspire us.
Our work is not to assess which great men were followers of thought.
We are inspiration for every person who lives and dies for the country.
These days there are occasions to remember many great men.
On 25th September, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Scientist on 2nd October, 11th October, Jaiprakash Narayan and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I am particularly moving ahead with the blessings of 2nd October.
Even if it's useful, it's an equal significance of handicraft with Khadi.
Brothers are teaching a lot.
The poor widow's house will be built by Khadi.
Therefore, this Deepawali will surely be spent on each other's houses and body.
Look, the sales almost doubled last time.
Dear countrymen, I am delighted to be in one thing.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose came to see me.
Everything was done by his daughter-in-law.
I got the opportunity to spend a lot of time with the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
"My name is Bhargavi Kaande.
I would like to assure you that in the coming days, the participation of the younger generation will increase and the participation of the younger generation will increase in government elections and governance.
Thank you. "Bhargavi said that the voter's name is incorporating and voting.
I want to especially congratulate the Election Commission of India in this regard.
Just a few years ago, we saw that our Electronics Commission was working only a regulator but it has changed a lot over the last few years.
It's a very good change, but it's not enough for the Election Commission to work.
Generally, I want to say that voting before the election day and drinking water.
One, a seven-year-old Kshitij Pandey, is studying in the 7th class at the Central School of Hindu University, Banaras.
I want to encourage scientific and interest in our children.
Only 9 years old.
When she asked her father, she said that she's been saying it all since the age of 5.
I asked you, where did you learn
Then I thought I wanted to share with you.
We're doing a lot of things that don't know and see you on the TV.
What's wrong with doing once a month
Friends from the sky, I have to wait for half to three hours.
It's better for a month's launch.
It was from Germany that the people of Hindustan were instigating the freedom struggle through radio.
Azad Hind Radio was launched on Thursday by the newsball.
He launched all languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathis, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu.
I have also completed one year by presenting Mann Ki Baat through the skyline.
We'll meet in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Let your instructions come.
The government is benefiting from your suggestions.
It starts a good change.
Your partnership is precious, invaluable.
Once again, my best wishes.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Malayalam Dialogue of Special Speech by Akash Vani to the people of India at 11 AM on 30 August 2015.
You have my greetings and I have got an opportunity to present my thoughts before you.
On the same occasion, the entire country celebrated me the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented new schemes for social security for the common people.
All the dignitaries have adopted these schemes for a very short time.
On the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had requested our sisters to execute security practices.
I see this as a good sign.
All the mothers and sisters are felicitated on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, I had delivered Jan Dhan Yojana a year ago to the people in a big way to talk to you.
The main road to the economy is in the banking sector, which has been designed as a bank friendly scheme to bring the ERPA to the poor.
Today more than one and a half lakh bank friends are working all over the country.
Young people have got jobs through this.
You will be happy to note that one lakh and a half thousand financial intelligent camps have been made to connect the banking sector with the economy and the poor within a year.
This is your job to continue this relationship.
All our accounts should be ineffective.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the priests of the Sufi tradition.
Their voices, their conversation style, i.e. generosity and beauty in the Sufi tradition, have musical tunes.
I am happy that they invited me to Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
These widows from all over the world will get an opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya.
It will be a pleasant moment for me, my dear farmer brothers and sisters, I want to repeat my heart.
It's already been mentioned about these things.
You must have heard me in the parlor, you must have heard me in public meetings.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have nothing to fear.
That's how I don't pay anybody.
We moved into an ordinance.
Tomorrow 31st August, Ordinance's deadline is over.
I decided to finish if the period is over.
My farmer brothers and sisters, "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" is not only a mirror for us but also a mantra for us.
I want to tell you something else.
Two days ago, 50 years of the 1965 war were completed.
Whenever you remember this war in 1965, Lal Bahadur Shastri is a memorable routine.
Besides, his magnificence of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan will also be remembered.
At the same time, it is absolutely natural to recall all the martyrs of the Tricolor of India and its glory and valour.
I salute all those associated with the 65-year war victory.
They bow down to the brave fighters.
We are inspiring such foolishness of history.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of Sufi tradition, I had the opportunity to talk to the country's leading scientists for hours and listen to their suggestions.
I am happy that India is showing great work in different fields of science.
Our scientists actually do great things.
How can this kind of research be brought to the common man
How to use these principles at a reasonable level
I have said in Mann Ki Baat that we should lead our students to the scientific sector.
I thought there were many opportunities and chances after this discussion.
I want to tell my dear young friends something special.
This time, many guests from across the world have come to India.
Why shouldn't we connect our festivals with cleanliness
This year the beginning of the rain was good.
There is a lot of food grains, oilseeds and peas in our country.
The poor need food and oil to cook vegetables.
However, this year, the crops are very happy and about 50 percent of the foodgrains and 33 percent of the oilseeds have grown.
I especially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as the victory day of Kargil in the history of our country.
The more the country's farmers are connected to the Earth, the more the military and the country's relationship.
Every soldier in the Kargil war has emerged a hundred enemies.
As a result of all their collective sacrifices, India can speak in front of the world today.
That is why my hundreds of greetings to our brave soldiers today, who have succeeded in Kargil.
Smt. Sutradhara Ghavachai, in Chennai, has sent a lot of suggestions.
I believe you all sent good instructions.
I want to express my perspective in one case.
I don't want to give any advice, while I don't find ways to the state governments, the central governments, the local governments and their responsibilities.
Two days ago, I noticed the scene of a car accident in Delhi, and after 10 minutes the accident took place, the scooter traveller was on the way.
He couldn't get any help.
Likewise, many people write to me more about the issue of imagination and talk about road safety and make the common people aware.
Be it Hoskot Niwasi Akshay of Bangalore, be it the happiness of the people of Mudubri in Karnataka, I do not remember the names of everyone.
Every accident takes place every day in our country.
One death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most tragic thing is that about one third of the deaths are young people between 15 and 25 years of age, each of whom takes the whole family.
Another thing in my heart is that a small group of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, whose work they have done has touched my mind.
'Brother No. 1' is an excellent brother to give a toilet as a gift to his brother on the day of Rakshabandhan.
Encouraging all such brothers and sisters to make toilets for their sisters and mothers and sisters in the entire district will not have to urinate in the open space.
Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh is a small village where workers live.
The people of that village have started and completed the work of constructing toilets for the past few months.
Now no one in that village has to urinate in the open space.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me about the problems of North-Eastern states from Guwahati.
Similarly, a team of Central Government officials decided to organize seven-day camps in Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam Sikkim and go to North-Eastern states.
In the days to come, the result of this effort will be.
The disappearance of science is very irritable.
In a way, science and technology are the aims of development.
Our IAS officers have come to the forefront of learning a lot of things and they should always be in talks with children in school or college around two or four hours a week, and their experiences are their strength.
We have started it and in the coming years we will get 24 hours of electricity in our villages.
The children of the village don't have to face difficulty when they are studying in the examination days.
If we want to start small and big industries in villages then we need electricity.
Today, if they want to charging mobile, they have to go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should also be available to the villages.
For this reason, the programme was inaugurated by Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, my heart has spoken about every Indian.
Similarly, the month of August and September is the time of our festivals.
We have many festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
In the midst of the needy, in the peaceful atmosphere, many of the 130 crore people used to say something like family members.
Sometimes it turns into inspiration for those who need their own things.
I just used my words, but I didn't think this programme was yours.
A quiet feeling.
Well, it's finally the chance.
'Mann Ki Baat' in a family, small and small children.
In a way, the programme will continue to liquidate the Oceans of a New India by giving birth to a new Ocean.
There have been many messages in the last few months, in which people said, 'Mann Ki Baat' is not sorry.
Sometimes I think it's a journey from my 'self' to 'Samasthi'.
This is a journey from 'I' to 'Name'.
My interaction with you for me was part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people started asking for a lot of questions that I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
As far as I was concerned, I had a chance to meet me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes because of my thoughts being inspired, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes.
When people put forward challenges in front of the country and society, they also suggest solutions.
In letters, people describe problems as well as say peace and some suggestions, some imagination, or obvious or indirect.
I mean, in your words, I am aware of the fact that how to get peace from the society in a way.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the nation and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of spiritual power, strength and prosperity within the people.
They need to unite the strength and the achievements, give them the opportunity and they need to be implemented.
Mann Ki Baat says that 130 crore people in the progress of the country are strong and active.
You can imagine how much energy I get from my heart when I imagine these things.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, we can continue Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, not for the country, but for the sake of independence, it was not an election for the sake of democracy.
Perhaps, in a country in the world, people there have voted not only for democracy, but for their residual rights, rights and requirements.
That's how the country saw in 1977.
Over 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, and we can see that this number is normal.
But if it looks at the population around the world, it is seen that more than one country than China has voted in India.
The number of people voted in 2019 is more than the total population of America, almost double.
The number of voters in India is more than the population in Europe.
This exposes the vastness and valuability of our democracy.
The Lok Sabha elections in 2019 were the largest democratic elections in the world.
You can imagine how large wealth and human power have been required to hold such elections.
This election was conducted by millions of teachers, officers and other journalists.
About 3 lakh members of the Armed Forces have been responsible for the success of this Mahayajna of democracy, and 20 lakh police personnel of various states have committed their deeds and hard work.
As a result of all these hardships, more than the previous time people voted for this time.
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh vocational machines have been required across the country to vote.
You can think how much you're ready.
A voter can't use his vote.
Polling stations have been set up for only one female voter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the electors had to travel for two days to reach there.
This is the right respect for democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
This polling station is situated at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahol-Spiti in Himachal Pradesh .
In this election, the vote percentage of women and men was almost similar.
Another fact that this time there are 78 women members who have lost history in the Parliament.
The Election Commission also congratulates everyone associated with the programme and bows down to the vigilant voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard me often say, 'Boke no book'.
I said, "Use a book instead of flowers" to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books somewhere.
His stories include the entire psychology of India.
When he was reading a story called 'Nasha', my heart turned to the economic imbalance spread across the society.
I remember the days I was young.
How the discussion took place overnight on this subject.
The son of Jamindar, Ishwari and the poor family of Beer, can learn from this story. If you don't care, you can't understand when the impact of the evil growth is over.
A sensitive child's love for his grandfather and his sensitivity at his young age.
We can see that when we come closer to Grandma, we have really got human sensitivity from the Hamid Festival of 4-5 years.
Happy to the farmer Haldu after losing the harvest, you won't have to sleep on the field in the extreme winter.
These stories are about a hundred years ago, but their relevance will still be felt.
K.
The giant and the little teaker.
Today, this library is a guide for everyone, including tribal children.
The referendum in Gujarat under the name of 'Wanche Gujarat' was a successful test.
Millions of people from all ages participated in this initiative to read the book.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I have asked you to find some time and give books for some time between your daily activities.
You will feel better and write about the reading book in 'Narendramodi App' and all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that people of our country are thinking about challenges not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your suggestions in 'Narendramodi App' and 'MyGovi'... and I saw a lot of people writing about the problem of water.
I have written about the challenges related to water, including Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Pawan Gaurai of Balgaon, Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has great significance in our culture.
You bless yourself as a maternal grandmother, and you're shouting at us.
Water shortage affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available by rain throughout the year.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
With the participation of people like other problems, we will find peace in this problem with the strength of one crore and a half million people with the strength of the people, with the ability and determination of cooperation and determination.
Giving the highest importance of water, the Ministry of Water Resources has given the form of a new Ministry of Water Resources in the country.
This will enable all water related issues to be decided.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the villagers across the country.
I wrote that to watch the water, to watch the water, to watch every rain and to watch the people of the village and to think about it with the villagers.
I am glad that they have done this and on the 22nd of this month millions of people have done their hard work in thousands of panchayats.
The people of the villages decided to conserve every water.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat program, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to what message has been given to all of us by the village chief of Lumung Panchayat in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand: "My name is Diply Kumar Ravidas.
People there are ready to play their active role in water conservation once more.
I extend my best wishes to all the village heads and all the villagers on the occasion of their excitement.
The people of the village now feel like competing to construct a temple for water in their village.
As I said, social efforts can create positive changes.
There is no sympathy in the country to face the problem of water.
In many ways, efforts are being made in different ways.
But the goal of everybody is to keep water, water conservation.
Drinking lines are improving in Punjab.
Through this endeavour, we can be saved from floods.
The lives of the rural people have changed due to the construction of a tank in Thamipalli, Telugu.
The small ponds built on the farming ground in Kabir Dham in Rajasthan have made a big change.
I read a social venture in Vellore, Tamilnadu, where 20,000 women gathered to revive the Nag river.
In collaboration with each other, she also read about the women of Gwalior who worked hard for rain water harvesting.
I am confident that if we work hard together, we can make it impossible.
When people gather together, the water will be waiting.
I say that water is touching and touching that touching water will create a new life.
One Water Conservation Movement will be organised to protect every drop of water.
It will also provide a boost to water conservation and water conservation.
I specially appeal to the remarkable personalities in different fields to perform a different preaching for water conservation.
People associated with the film industry, the Sports sector, the media, the friends, the social organisations, the people who are associated with the cultural organisations, who are singing tales and singing singings, should in their own way lead the gathering.
Let us awaken the society, unite the society and join the society.
Look, we can see changes in our eyes.
I appeal to all of you to share information about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you have the opportunity to go to Porbandar, the birthplace of a renowned father, you have to see another house behind the father's house, where there is a 200-year-old water jewellery, which still has water.
There's a plan to stop rain water.
I always say that those who go to the Kirti Mandir must see that water jewellery.
There are many kinds of water conservation systems at different places.
Distribute information to share you with Janshakti4alShakti Hash Tag.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you and thank the people of the world.
Everyone, when the sun rises in every corner of the world, the lovers of Yoga welcome the sun, it is a journey until the sun sets.
The Twitter showed how the people of the world, the Prime Ministers, the well-known people and the common people celebrated Yoga in their country.
The world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that a healthy and sensitive person is required for the creation of a healthy society.
Therefore, the promotion of Yoga is an important matter related to social conservation.
Such services are accepted and they should be respected.
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Minister's Award for those who played a key role in promoting and propagating Yoga in 2019.
You will not be able to imagine how important they played in promoting Yoga.
Japan Yoga Niketan is organising several institutes and training courses.
Miss of Italy.
It's a very inspiring example.
Would it be a matter related to Yoga if Indians were to stay behind
Behar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger, was also honored and they have been working with dedication to Yoga for the last decade.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Muni also honoured him and established the Life Mission and the Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes.
I'll wait for your instructions.
Together with your thoughts, it is a great journey for me and Mann Ki Baat is only for me.
Come on, let's be together, let's share the ideas.
I'm listening to what you understand, I'll take care of it.
Sometimes you try to live with your thoughts.
You must be blessed.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come together and share the happiness of Mann Ki Baat and continue to fulfill the responsibility of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February, 2019
(Muslims say - 53rd lunch) Premier Indians, greetings.
These brave heroes sacrificed their lives for hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
Our brave sons stayed guarded tonight to sleep peacefully.
At the same time, the attackers responded in their own language.
You must have seen how the attack took place within 100 hours.
The army is determined to root out the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the responsibilities of their families were seen through mediums, which enhances the entire country's enthusiasm.
It is inspiring for us to express our condolences to the father of Dhirjan Ratna Thakur, Bhagalpur, Bihar.
The country acknowledges the unprecedented courage of the martyrs of Prasanna Saheb's wife Minaji in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
It's promised to add another one of the only sons in the CRPF.
This is what we see in every household of our brave and brave martyrs.
I want to tell the youngsters that they want to know and understand the feelings of these families.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that we all waited for in the long run after Independence is being realised.
It is natural for the people to be quiet and eager about this.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has expressed his happiness in the completion of the National War Memorial at Omkar Shetty, from Uri, Karnataka.
I am surprising that there was no national war memorial in India.
We needed a war memorial to describe the brave legends of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to need a memorial.
I am happy that the decision to build a National War Memorial will be completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, we will lay the foundation stone of this National Military Memorial for our soldiers.
The country will make a small effort to build the sea.
This new memorial is built near the heart of Delhi, i. e. India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I am confident that our people will be equal to going to a pilgrimage to this national military monument.
The National Military Memorial reflects the gratitude of the nation to the great martyrs after Independence.
The design of the memorial shows the valuable courage of our brave soldiers.
The National Army Memorial has been designed in three categories, depicting a journey from the birth of every soldier to martyrdom.
The Jewel of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the martyrdom of the martyred army.
The second cycle shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This trend shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the most important martyred soldiers for the country are recorded in gold letters.
And then there is a rescue cycle, which demonstrates security.
This tree has a layer of dense trees.
I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation in October last year.
This was also a reflection of the thought that the country should be grateful to the men and women who have been unrest for our security.
I am confident that you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share pictures from there with the social media, it may be inspired by others, they will be enthusiastic to see these memorials.
My dear countrymen, I am receiving thousands of letters and suggestions from you for Mann Ki Baat through several media.
On 3rd March, the birthday of Jamshedji Tata.
The two personalities are from different family backgrounds that have riched the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata are honoured by Mann Ki Baat, in a way, like the proud history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great men have enhanced not only in Jharkhand but also in the entire country.
People are grateful for their contribution to the entire nation.
Do you know why the Englishmen have delayed such a terrible path
Because the Englishman who had built such a great empire was also afraid of him.
Birsa had slaughtered the British rule using his traditional ammunition and vills using guns and guns.
Birsa Mata fought not only the British for national freedom but also for the socio-economic freedom of tribals.
He did this in his short lifetime.
He spreads the light like the sun in the darkness of the despised and despised.
He committed suicide at the young age of 25.
The brave sons of Bharatamba, like Birsa Munda, have emerged everywhere in the country.
There will be no cornerstone of the Indian diaspora who has played their part in this centuries of freedom struggle.
If the personalities like Birsa Munda make us aware of our existence, then the personalities like Jamshedji Tata have been awarded to the greatest institutions of the country.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies and that it should be a business center.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, called the Indian Institute of Science, was a result of his long-term perspective.
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Meeting between Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda on a ship between a visit to America.
It is said that this discussion has been done to establish the Indian Institute of Science.
Dear countrymen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country, Mr. Morarji Bhai, was on 29th February.
As you all know, this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai, the lord of immense, peaceful personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarji Bhai had the privilege of presenting the budget at the highest time in the Parliament of India.
He had to pay his price in the old age.
The then government arrested him and put him in jail.
But when he won the Janata Party elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
In this 44th Amendment, the legislative procedures of Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies were made to be published in the press.
Some of the powers of the Supreme Court were re-established by this amendment, adding that the legislative rights obtained by Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be repealed even during the urgent period.
If the Cabinet has written, it will declare the President an emergency and the period of emergency cannot be delayed once more than six months.
In 1975, Morozibai ensured that he would not repeat the democracies in the future by announcing an emergency.
The future generation will always remember his great contribution in maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again, he pays homage to the great leader.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every year, people are excited about Padma Awards.
They have brought positive changes in the lives of others in different ways in the strength of their learning.
It's a great deal to bring a rare painting to the new plateau.
I have gifted former US President Barack Pyruda to Tree of Life, a artist made by Abdul Ghafur.
Among those who received the Padma Awards are known as the servant of Shabbir Said Gomata of Marathwada.
You'll be surprised to hear about the Tao Porchon-Inch in the US, and the linch is now a big institution for Yoga.
My dear countrymen, 12 of those awarded the Padma Awards this year are the best.
Normally, a few people associated with the farm sector have come to the list of pamphlets.
It is the lifestyle of the changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I'm going to tell you something of my heart, I have understood it for the last few days.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have got the benefit of this scheme.
I saw how big it brings about in the lives of the poor.
If you know someone who is uncomfortable for treatment because of lack of money, tell them about this plan.
This scheme is for the poor, dear countrymen, is going to start the exams in schools.
In the next few weeks across the country, different educational boards will start exams, tenth class and twelfth class.
All the students, their parents and all the teachers who are writing the exams are heartfeltly happy.
A few days ago, a big event was organised at Town Hall in Delhi.
With the help of technology in this town hall, I have been able to talk to millions of students and teachers from across the country and abroad.
Through radio, I talk to millions of families in a way every month.
Sometimes I think you are part of my family when you talk to you and read your letters and listen to the suggestions sent by you on the phone.
It gives me a feeling of comfort.
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
I've been telling you Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to you all.
Mann Ki Baat January 2019
On the 21st of this month, a very sad news was received by the country.
Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji became Divangat in Siddhaganga Math, Tumkur district of Karnataka.
Shiv Kumaraswamy dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us - Kai Kai Kai Kai Kailas - that is, it is like a hard work that has been done in Kailas, the residence of Lord Shiva.
Shivkumar Swamiji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people in his 111-year lifetime.
He was reputed as an innovator in English, Sanskrit and Canada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He tried his entire life to spread food, home, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
His prediction was all kinds of goodness for the farmers.
Siddhaganga Math was regularly organised by family-cultural fairs.
I am fortunate to receive the blessings of the supreme Swami ji.
On this occasion, Kalam Saheb had heard a poem about Swamiji.
Once again, I offer respect to that great soul.
Dear Countrymen, on 26 January, 1950, the Constitution was formed in our country.
In that day, our country is for Republic.
Yesterday we celebrated Republic Day as Kennema.
But I want to tell you something else.
The National Consensus Day is being celebrated as National Voters' Day.
People from all over the world are surprised to see the massive election process in India.
It is natural for the citizens of our country to be proud of the Election Commission.
It must have been heard that only one voter has a polling booth in the Gir forest of Gujarat.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission for its continuous efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission of all the States and the security personnel and others to ensure free and unsustainable elections that are participants in the voting process.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country.
This will be the first opportunity for young people born in the twentieth century to use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to reassure the responsibility of the nation.
They're going to decide the country's division.
It is time to link your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I appeal to the young generation to register as a voter if it is older to vote.
At the same time, we have to think that voting is our own commitment.
If you don't vote for any reason in your life then it should be a painful feeling.
I'm sorry to see something wrong in the country.
Our country is brilliant.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was one of those great men.
On 23rd January, his birth anniversary was celebrated in different ways throughout the country.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the brave men who played their part in Indias freedom.
Some rooms and buildings were locked in the Red Fort since Independence.
These locked rooms of the Red Fort have become a museum today, dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Indian National Army.
Every stone of this museum smells our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum reflects the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle and inspires us to move towards history.
At this very same place, the British ruled against the brave sons of Bharatamba - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gur Baksh Dhilan and Major General Shanwas Khan.
I took care of the hat in the museum, and the tourists coming here also wanted to see the hat and inspire patriotism.
However, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders must be repeated in different ways to the new generation.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, 75 years ago, raised the tri-color at a place where I flagged the tri-color.
Similarly, in the Red Fort in October, 2018, it will be surprising to all, even if the tricolor is highlighted in the Red Fort, because there is a routine of flagging on August 15.
Today, the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Azad Hind Government was celebrated.
Netaji shook the hearts of all Indians through the madrassas like Delhi Chalo, Thu and My Khun Do, My Tummy and Asadi Dumga (Delhi, Give me blood, I will give you freedom).
Over the past several years, the requirement of the files related to Netaji was to be made available to the public.
I'm glad I could do it.
I remember the day Netaji's family visited the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhash Bose.
I am happy that in Delhi, efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great people of India.
26 Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar, whether it is Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir, it is a pleasure.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, when we talk about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
He also chose radio to interact with the people and started Subhash Babu Azad Hind Radio in 1942.
I believe that this radio station was broadcasting news bulletins throughout the week, which was in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathis, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu.
Gujarati M.
Who.
Vyas played an important role.
The programmes launched by Azad Hind Radio liked the common people.
These programmes were immensely encouraging the warriors of the freedom struggle.
In this Kranti Mandir the Visual Museum is also arranged .
Indian arts and cultures have been very attractively explored.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum wherein over 450 paintings and other art works have been done for three centuries.
The museum showcases the excellence of great artists like Amruta Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy and Cylos Mukherjee.
I specially invite you all to go there to keep the writings of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You're wondering why I'm telling you about the art of Gurudev Tagore's great scriptures.
You might have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician yet.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds, many natural scenes, more than that he has invented human nature through art in Canvas.
It is a matter of note that Gurudev has not given names to many of his scriptures.
He thought that those who saw his drawings should understand the painting themselves and the message that he had given in it would be known through his own perspective.
His pictures are displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
Our magnificence has conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas was a glorious man.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Saint Ravidas.
Saint Ravidas ji's teachings are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Through his message, he tried to convey the importance of learning and learning throughout his life.
In our space programmes, many young scientists of the country have contributed to the Space Program.
Today, we are proud of the grace and sounding rockets that our students have developed.
On 24th January, Kalam Sat has been launched by our students.
Sounding rockets made by students in Odisha are also setting up new records.
The Space Missions have been launched in the last four years since Independence to 2014.
We have established a world record for launching 104 satellites through a single environmental vehicle.
We will soon ensure the presence of India in the moon through the Chandrayaan-2.
Our country uses space technology to protect the lives and lives of the people.
Whether it is climate change or rail or road safety, there is a lot of help from space technology.
Naval equipment has been distributed amongst our brothers engaged in fisheries, which is helpful in their safety and economic development.
We are using space technology to bring government services to the people and to determine its responsibility effectively.
Nearly 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been geo-tagged in the housing for all i. e.
Moreover, about three and a half crore landscapes have been geo-tagged under Mandega.
Our satellites are a symbol of the growing strength of the country today.
Through our competitive satellite launch service, India launches satellites of not only developed countries but also developed countries.
The sky and the stars are always attractive to the children.
Our space programmes provide opportunities for children to go beyond the limits that they thought it impossible today.
This is also a perspective of monitoring the stars for our children and inspiring them to find new stars.
6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
This time, sportspersons from all the states of Khelo India have shown their best performance in their own way.
The life of many medal winners is inspiring.
I read that the young sportsperson, Akash Gorkha, got a silver medal in Gosti, and Ramesh Ji, the father of the sky, worked as a guard in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with the family.
And that is the man who lives in Sonali Helvi Satara, the captain of the Under 21 Women's Cabdi team in Maharashtra.
She lost her father at a very young age and encouraged her brother and mother Sonali's ability.
Generally, girls are not encouraged to participate in the games like Kabbadi.
But Sonali was chosen by the cabdis, the best performance was shown.
Abhinav Shah, the 10-year-old Assamese, is the youngest gold medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshaya Baswanikmati, won a gold medal in the inauguration.
We should recall that when we talk about the creation of India, the young power is the idea of a New India.
These stories of Khelo India remember not only the contributions of the people of big cities in the creation of a New India but also the contributions of youngsters and children from small towns and villages and young Sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of many beautiful festivals you have named.
But have you heard of a beautiful competition in the toilet
More than 5000 toilets participated in this strange contest for nearly a month.
I appeal to all the Sarpanches and the village heads to lead this movement in my Panchayat.
You must share pictures of your clean beautiful toilets with Mylathar in social media.
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we launched a remarkable journey to defecate in the open space with the aim of defecating the country.
My little friends, the exam days are coming closer.
Anshul Sharma MyGov, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, says that I want to talk about exams and Exam Warriors.
Anshul ji thanked him for bringing this matter in mind.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the test season.
Today, Mann Ki Baat wanted to discuss the matter, but the programme will be held at 11 am on 29th January, 2019 at 11pm in the examination papers and will be attended by parents and teachers along with students from all over the country.
This time students from other countries are also participating in the event.
I would like to talk to young friends about all aspects of the examination, especially the stress free exam.
Some of these suggestions and suggestions will certainly be placed in front of you during this programme in Town Hall.
You must share this program.
You can see it broadcasting through social media or Namo App Lutte.
Dear Countrymen, 30th January is the memorial of the revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the country will pay homage to the martyrs.
We must pay homage to every two-minute martyrs anywhere.
Remember the renowned Bapu, his dreams are fulfilled, the creation of a New India, the creation of a New India, and the creation of a New India as citizens.
The journey of 2019 will be successfully taken forward.
Greetings to you all, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018 December
Dear countrymen, Namaskar.
We're going to end the year 2018.
We are entering 2019.
Obviously, this time, we can also listen to the discussions of the hopes of the last year and the coming year.
Whether it is the life of the person or the life of the society or the life of the nation, everybody has to look back and look forward to it as much as possible.
That is why the achievements of experiences are achieved and there is a self-confidence to do something new.
Besides bringing about changes in our lives, we have to think of what we can contribute towards taking the country and society forward.
Many good wishes to you all on the occasion of 2019.
As a result of the determination of the people of the country, the glory of cleanliness is 95.
After Independence, the first time from the Red Fort, the 75th anniversary of Azad Hind Government was flagged off.
The country was awarded the Champions of the Earth, the highest ecosystem of the United Nations.
Indias efforts have been recognized globally in terms of solar energy and climate change.
International Solar Alliance (ISA) was the first edition of International Solar Alliance (ISA) in India.
Our country has had unprecedented excellence in the Ice of Doing Business Rankings.
Our daughters have enhanced the country's pride by enhancing the world through the navigational sewerage.
The country's first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has created a new revolution in the field of waterways.
Bogibeel Bridge, the country's longest rail-road bridge, was dedicated to the nation, which was inaugurated at Pakyong for the country's first and the second largest airport in Sikkim.
India has won 19 cricket worldwide and Blind Cricket Worldwide.
This time India has achieved many medals in Asian Games.
India has shown great performance in Para Asian Games.
If we start listing all the social efforts of the country, our Mann Ki Baat will continue to go up to 2019.
All this was possible through the unrestful efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey will continue in 2019 and the progress and progress of India and our country will rise to new heights.
My dear countrymen, we lost some of our specific relatives in this December.
Dr. Jayachandran was known as the best treatment provider for the poor.
Similarly, on 25th December, Sulagiti Narasamy died in Karnataka.
Sulagiti Narasimha helped the pregnant mothers and sisters in delivery.
They provided services to thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
There are many inspirational people like Jaichandran and Sulagiti Narasam.
They have dedicated their lives for the betterment of all in the society.
When we talk of healthcare, we also want to say about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, Uttaranchal.
Some participants told me that some young doctors from the city were walking on camp and treating the poor.
Heart Lungs Critical Centre is conducted every month in medical camps where there is an arrangement for free treatment and diseases.
Today, hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctor friends who are sufficiently serviced must be appreciated.
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Mission was a successful movement through social efforts.
Just a few days ago, more than three lakh people were involved in the cleaning programme in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
The City Corps, Services Funds, School College students and all the people of Jabalpur were actively involved in this campaign for cleanliness.
I'm the Betterindia.
When I get the opportunity, I definitely go to the Betterindia.com and try to know about such inspirations.
I am glad that many such websites introduce us many stories that inspire us to life.
Com is trying to promote positivity in the society and to make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, the story of your story.com Young Innovators and the success of the industrialists tells us a lot.
Get the positivity together and make it viral.
I am confident that more and more people will know about our heroes bringing about changes in society.
It's very easy to spread negativeity.
But in our society, we have a lot of good things that can be achieved through the simultaneous efforts of 130 crore people.
Hanna is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hannah taught him to cry, learned about his various heads and proved himself capable.
I wish them a bright future for all the countrymen.
Hanna has great good wishes and blessings.
Similarly, a 16-year-old girl and Rajini had a lot of discussions on media.
You must have read it.
Rajini Junior Mahila Gushti won gold medal at Championship.
As soon as Rajni got the medal, the boy went to the nearby milk shop and drink a glass of milk.
After that, the royal medal was covered in a cloth and put it in the bag.
You think why Rajini drinks a glass of milk.
That kid was honored by father Jasmer Singh, who sells a luxury in a stall in the drink.
Rajini said that his father suffered very much in bringing him to this stage.
Jasmer Singh is going to work every morning before Rajini and his brothers wake up.
When Rajni Boxing wanted to learn, when she told her father, her father organized all possible things and encouraged her daughter's enthusiasm.
Rajnik Gusti Training had to be tied up with old gloves, because at that time the family's financial condition was very bad.
Rajini didn't get excited even after all these obstacles, she had to learn.
A medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni in Pune has become the fastest man in the world.
The boy traveled 300 kilometers a day on a bike for 159 days.
The child's enthusiasm in walking on the bike is surely admirable.
We cannot be inspired by such achievements.
Many good wishes to our farmers brothers and sisters.
In diversity, the smell of unity, unity, unity, excellence, etc. is filled with our festivals.
There is no difference between society and nature in Indian culture, and there is only one person and affluence here.
The artists based on festivals, Panchangam, are a good example of our close relationship with nature.
It will also enhance the knowledge of planets and stars, along with festivals throughout the year.
It's decided on who the calendar is overlooked.
Festivals and Festivals are celebrated on the basis of Grahnakshatras in many places.
Gudi Padwa, Chadichand and Ugadi are all celebrated according to the moonlit night, while Tamil Putanth, Vishu, Vaishakham, Baisakhi, Poila Baisak and Bihu are celebrated on the basis of the sun artist.
In many of our festivals, we can see that the feelings of water and rivers are particularly inclusive.
Chhath Festival is associated with sunset in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people are immersed in sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have an archaeological importance, on the other hand, the lessons of life and the inspiration to live with each other's brotherhood.
I wish you all the best wishes of 2019 and wish you all the best to celebrate the coming festivals.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the country come and participate in the Kumbh festival.
The people of the Kumbh share faith and devotion.
Together, millions of people from all over the country and abroad gather together.
The tradition of Kumbh has spread in our great cultural heritage.
This time, from 15th January, you will also be waiting for the world famous Kumbh Festival to be held in Prayagraj.
The Kumbh Festival has already started reaching Saint Makal.
It is a great testimony that the UNESCO is included in the list of Integral Cultural Heritage of Humanity to make Manisila important globally.
Just a few days back, the ambassadors of several countries witnessed preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
There the nations of many countries have been enhanced.
The Kumbh, which will be held in Prayagraj, will be attended by people from more than 150 countries.
Especially for the youth, this is a great study experience.
I had gone to Prayag Raj a few days ago and I saw the preparations for the Kumbh Festival going on with enthusiasm.
This time it is also important for cleanliness.
There will be devotional purity and the message will be delivered far away.
This time devotees can visit Akshayvad after the sacred bath at Sangam.
This sanctuary, a symbol of the faith of the people, has been closed in the fort for hundreds of years, so the devotee did not want to see it.
This time everyone's been allowed to get there.
You must also participate in the Kumbh Festival and share the pictures of different heads in the middle of the society so that more and more people get inspiration to go to Kumbh.
May the Teacher's Kumbh be a great pilgrimage of Indian philosophy.
May the Kumbh of faith be the great Kumbh of nationalism.
Be it the Kumbh of Artificial Intelligence, the great Kumbh of the Creational Powers.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Republic Day celebrations on 26th January, people are very happy that day we recall the great personalities of our Constitution.
This year we celebrate the centenary birth anniversary of the revered Bapu.
South African President Mr.
Siril Ramaphosa is reaching India as the Chief Guest on Republic Day this year.
There was an incredible connection between the renowned Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan, the glorious one was from this South Africa.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi commenced his first Satyagraha with strong opposition to diversity.
He set up Phoenix and Tolstoy Families from where the glimpse of peace and justice swept over the world.
He had the power and inspiration to live in prison for so many years.
Mandela wrote about Bapu, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because he started testing here.
This is where he has shown his strong stand for justice, where he has raised the vision of Satyagraha and the struggles.
He saw Bapu as a role model.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspiring all over the world but their ideals also inspire us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, the conferences of DGPs were held at Kevadia on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat, where the Statue of Unity is the highest statue in the world.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He always lived in conservation of the axis of India.
Sardar Saheb thought that the strength of India depends on the diversity here.
He is honoured by Sardar Sahebs passionately dedicated to him through this reward of unity.
Dear Countrymen, on 13th January, Guru Gobind Singh's birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna.
For a long time, his Karmabhoomi was North India and he was shot dead in Namdeda, Maharashtra.
In Patna, the land of birth, the land of Karmabhoomi, North India, the last moment of life in Namded.
In a way, he received his blessings throughout the year.
After Guru Tej Bahadur ji became a martyr, Guru Gobind Singh ji won the rank of Guru at a young age of 9.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a peaceful and incredible personality, but whenever an attempt was made to raise the voice of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice to the poor and the weak.
He was a divine man full of bravery, valour, sacrifice and poetry.
He had sympathetic weapons and scientific.
As a warrior, Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi, Urdu and other languages were known.
I once again bow to Guru Gobind Singh.
Dear countrymen, there are many good events in the country but there are no detailed discussions about them.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The program will take place on January 27.
It is a commendable thing that I am going beyond and trying to give people waking up and wisdom.
India should be prosperous when it is clean.
Nutritious diet is the most important for good health.
To begin this matter.
It is important to learn lessons about the importance of food in childhood.
Come on, let us move forward to take new heights for new inspiration, enthusiasm and determination. Let us change ourselves and the country...
Similarly, MyGov, Ambush Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar and Vikas Yadav from Patna and Monica Jain from Delhi, Burdwan from West Bengal, and music scientist from Nagpur are almost the same questions.
They say that usually people are associated with you through modern technology, social and mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It was in 1998.
I was working as an organisational worker of the Indian Janta Party in Himachal.
May was the month.
It was a little dad.
I didn't understand anything.
Seeing my response, he said, look, Sab, listen to the radio.
In the next few days, Akashvani conducted a survey on Manki Baat.
Some Facebook responses are very funny.
About 70 percent of the surveyed listen to Mann Ki Baat regularly.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has grown positive thinking in society.
Mann Ki Baat has encouraged many republics.
There has been widespread discussions about India Positive.
I am happy to see that the radio becomes more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets Mike, what if millions and millions of people are listening
Their findings are not political in this program.
As soon as Mann Ki Baat was started, it was decided not to create politics, not to be the good songs of the government and not to be Modi.
The most inspired to implement my determination was from you.
Small stories of 130 crore people will always remain.
This country will bring new inspiration and enthusiasm to new heights.
When I read the letter, a feeling like that takes it in my mind.
With two words, I share it with you in my experience.
When will a government get strength to launch the Selfie seed dollar in a small village in Haryana, not just across the country but abroad
People from all sections of society, known as celebritis, joined together and changed the thinking of the society and made awakening in a new language that today's generation understands.
Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of government, it is a matter of society.
Manki Baat is a matter of progress for India.
India's life is not political, it is not political.
India's life is social and social strength.
There are thousands of heads in social life, one of them is political.
If everything is political, it's not a good arrangement for society.
Sometimes political events and political activity, and other talents of society and their livelihoods are suppressed.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple job for me.
People's letters come before all Mann Ki Baats.
My effort is to see the maximum letters before Mann Ki Baat and read the commandants.
A lot of phone calls are heard.
As the episode of Mann Ki Baat is coming closer, I play the inputs and the ideas that you send during the journey.
So whenever you read a letter, the climate of a writer becomes a part of my thoughts.
It's not just a mirror for me.
I have guided the lives of an influential person who has not stayed for the last 40-45 years, has visited almost every district of the country and has spent a lot of time in remote districts of the country.
There is also an attempt to keep in mind the instructions related to letters that cannot be included in Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to thank my friends from ASEAN, FM radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels and social media.
Because of their efforts, Mann Ki Baat can reach more people.
The ASEAN team prepares all episodes to launch in many languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat with the same feeling in the tone of Modi in the local language.
So they turn into Modi for 30 minutes.
Greetings and thanks to them for their talent and valour.
I'm asking you all to listen to this program in local languages.
Mann Ki Baat, in his channels, wishes to thank friends of media who are regularly listening every month.
Any person in politics is not happy with the media, they feel that they get a very little coverage, and if they get the coverage then it is a negative coverage.
If you hadn't had any cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'll be doing everything in my family.
It's easier to understand if we don't get in the middle of the old sheep in our own life.
I don't know that a man has abandoned his thoughts and accepted the ideas of Aparan.
Today's youngsters do not do their own self-confidence. If they believe in something then they leave everything behind them.
Sometimes people can hear about interaction with young people in their families.
In fact, the limit for talking to young people in most families is very narrow.
It is said that do not do so about things that are studying for a long time or about habits and lifestyle.
Through several programmes, I have been trying to continually talk to the youth through social media.
I'm trying to learn from them what they're doing and what they think.
They've always got a fragrance of ideas.
They are very powerful, innovators and focused attention.
Through Mankiba, I am trying to connect the problems of the youth and their things more.
Sometimes there's a complaint that young people ask more questions.
I say it's better for the youth to ask questions.
We feel that today's youngsters are very ambitious and think very big things.
It is good to dream big dreams and to achieve great achievements - it is a new India and New India.
Some say young people want to do things at the same time.
I'm asking you what's wrong.
Several things are done at the same time, because they're talented in multi-tasking.
If we look around, it is social organisations, startups or start-ups, or other sectors, it is young people who bring big changes in society.
Young people who have the courage to ask questions and to see new dreams.
If you bring the thoughts of the youth to the ground, give them an open environment to express it then they can bring a positive change in the country.
My dear countrymen, I want to tell you about the Constitution Day in this Mann Ki Baat.
Vineeta says that the day is very important because we enter the 70th year of the formation of the Constitution.
Thank you very much for this idea.
The Constitutional Building Church took two years and 11 months and 17 days to finish this historical work.
Just imagine that within three years we have given such a comprehensive and comprehensive governance framework.
Today, the example of Tim Management and Productivity is that they have built the Constitution at such an unusual pace.
This inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in record time.
The Constitutional Building Church was the confluence of great talents of the country and all of them were committed to empowering India and giving the Constitution to the nation that empowered the poor and the poor.
When 60 years of India's Republic of India were completed in 2010, Bhoja Yatra was organised in Gujarat by putting an elephant on its side.
It was an opportunity to enhance the spirit of governance among the youth and to connect them with different heads of the Constitution.
In 2020, we will complete 70 years as Ganatrit and Republic and 75 years of our independence will be completed in 2022.
Come, let us take forward our constitutional values and ensure peace and progress and prosperity in our country.
He said that while Indians are different, we must be the nation first.
India First - India is the first Dr.
In all the State Governments and Union Territories, it has been decided to celebrate the occasion.
Similarly, it will be celebrated in every country of the world.
At the same time, a train will also run through the pathways to the sacred places related to Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I recall the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb when I attended this meeting last day.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, the Gurudwara had great destruction.
Our journey will continue.
As much as you are connected with, our journey will be deeper and will give happiness to everyone.
Sometimes some people have a question in their minds - what did I get with Mann Ki Baat
Your great desires are my great desires...
Come on, let's go ahead through this journey.
31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the beloved one of us.
Like every year, the youth of the country are ready to run for the unity of the country.
Now the weather is very comfortable.
My request is that you all willingly participate in the Ranfor Unit.
About six and a half months before Independence, the world's most famous international famous 'The Time' magazine became the picture of Sardar Patel on the cover page of the luck published on 27th January, 1947.
With the main article, they gave a picture of India, which we did not see today.
It was a picture of India that has been scattered in different parts.
There were more than 550 territories at that time.
The British had not been interested in India.
He said how he had done rescue operations during the floods in Ahmedabad in 1920.
It is said that Burdoli has given a direction to the Satyagraha.
From the farmers and workers to the industrialists, everybody was able to believe him in his faith and commitment to the country.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be more special and on this day Sardar Patel will be dedicated to the nation by paying a true tribute to the Statue of Unity.
This statue situated on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double the height of the Statue of Liberty of America .
This is the world's tallest and glorious idol.
Every Indian can be proud of being the highest statue in the world.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the soil, will be decorated with the sky.
Dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we celebrated 'Infantry Day'.
I salute all the people of Indian society.
I salute the families of the soldiers for their adventure.
But we, the people of Hindustani, do you know why we celebrate 'Infantry Day'
This was the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army descended into the soil of Kashmir and waited for Kashmir from the slopes.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has a direct connection to this historic event.
I was playing an interview with Sam Manek Shah, the great army officer of India.
In that interview, Field Marshal Manek Shah was reminded of the time he was a Field Marshal.
At that time, in October, 1947, there was a military strike in Kashmir.
31st October is the memorial of our former Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi.
Indraji is honored.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are all important in the world of sports.
It's not the root of any player's victory.
The next two meetings were held in memory.
First of all, the Asian Para Games in Jakarta is an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in 2018.
Similarly, there was an opportunity to visit the warriors of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
In Youth Olympics 2018, our youngsters have shown their best performance in this regard.
We have achieved 13 medals and three medals in Mix Index.
This is the story of Indian Sports touching new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where no one is thinking.
When he was 8, he lost his father.
He lived in orphanage for the next 8 years.
After leaving the orphanage, DTC buses cleaned up and worked as a waiter on the streets of Delhi.
Today, gold medals are being received for India in the same Narayan International.
It is not just that, however, India is raising the heights of excellence in sports.
India has never achieved an Olympic Medal in Judo, Senior Lovely or Junior Lovely.
But Tababi Devi made history by winning a silver medal in Judo in Youth Olympics.
16-year-old young player Tababi Devi is living in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a laborer, the mother is fishing.
Sometimes this kid's family had no money to buy anything for food.
Even in such a situation, the fort has not been excited about the enthusiasm of the goddess Tababi.
And then he created history by winning a medal for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is inspirational.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is the bottom of New India.
Dear Countrymen, in 2017, we have successfully organised FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
As a tournament that has been successfully organised, the entire world appreciated it.
This year, India has got the opportunity to organize a Men Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey Wald Cup will run from 28 November to 16 December.
In the minds of all Indians, whatever game you play, whatever game you want to play, Hockey will definitely have a choice.
India has gifted great Hockey players.
Whenever there is talk of World Hockey, the story of Hockey will be incomplete apart from these great players in India.
Hockey Mantrik knows Major Dhyanchand all over the world.
After that, Balveendar Singh Senior, Lesli Cloudies, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pilgrim Hockey had a long journey.
Even today, teams of India inspire the new generation of Hockey through the successes achieved due to their sacrifices and sacrifices.
Sports lovers have a good opportunity to see a thrilling game.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage the Indian team not only to do it but to encourage all teams.
But in a new era, in a new way, in a new generation, in a new spirit, in a new spirit, in a new spirit, in a new dream, this is going on today.
Some are teaching children, some are teaching elderly, some are related to cleanliness, some are helping farmers.
There is no desire behind doing all this, but it has dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young man learned to play Vellchair Basketball to help the Vellchair basketball team of Divyangs.
This excitement, this dedication is an act in Mission Mode.
Can any Indian be proud of this
My dear brothers and sisters, when I looked at the issues related to Mann Ki Baat this time, I found a very attractive note from Pondicherry.
He has written in MyGovi, Please tell Mann Ki Baat how the people of India and their lifestyle and traditions are the best examples of co-operation with nature.
We need to learn from them what we need to make traditions a part of our lives for sustainable development.
Manesh ji, I congratulate you for keeping this issue before the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter of inspiration for us to look at our proud past and culture that today, the world, especially the western states, seek new ways for environmental protection and a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and plants like gods and goddesses.
People of Madhya Pradesh, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the tree named almond and Arjun.
In the desert like Rajasthan, we have shown how the Bishnoi community should be environmental protection.
Especially for the protection of trees, they don't want to sacrifice their lives, but they don't allow a tree to be damaged.
The sages of Arunachal believe that they have direct connections with the tigers.
They consider them like their own brothers.
The people from the Warli community of Maharashtra see the tiger as guests and the presence of tigers for them is rich.
The Gound Tribes of the Middle India stop fishing in some parts of the Kethan river during fisheries.
They look at these areas as fish bases, and they get abundant fish due to this practice.
In the lonely areas of Nilgiri in southern India, a small fertilizer society, Doda, is traditionally building their homes because of the materials available in that area.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that tribal society believes in living peacefully and unanimously, but if someone harms their natural resources then they will not be able to fight against their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were the people of the tribal community.
Come on, let's show their respect.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat says about those who do unusual things for the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Gurubachan Singh of Punjab.
A common teacher was the marriage of Gurubachan Singh.
But you will be surprised to know that when a common farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh told the father of the bride that he had forwarded it was the real strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them, "Let me promise that no wine will burn in the field anymore.
You can imagine how much social strength it has.
Gurubachan Singh ji said this thing would be unsuccessful, but this incident tells us how wide his personality is and there are many families in our society that make personal things a matter of harmony.
Shri Gurubachan Singh ji's family presented such examples before us.
I read another village in Punjab about the stone mazar near Nabha.
The people of Kallar Majra, instead of burning the window, melt it to the ground and use technology for it.
Brother Gurubachan Singh greetings.
Congratulations to the people of Malar Majra and others for making great efforts to keep the environment clean.
You are the real inheritors of Indian heritage, a healthy lifestyle.
Om Pyao Shanti: Antariksha, Antariksha, Shanti, Apah Shanti, Shanti, Shanti, Vishvedev, Shanti, Shanti, Shanti Reva Shanti, Sam Shanti Shanti Shanti Shanti Shanti Shanti. This means, or God is peaceful in all three worlds, in water, in earth, in the sky, in the atmosphere, in volcano, in medicinal herbs, in herbs, in the forests, in the forests, in the forests, in the forests.
In organisms, in the heart, in you, in the particles of the world, there is peace everywhere.
For India, the First World War was a big event.
Obviously, we didn't have a direct connection with that war.
Yet, our soldiers fought and played a very big role and carried out great martyrdom.
When Indian soldiers came to war, they showed the world that they were not behind anyone.
In the First World War, the world saw the pitcher of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers and more ordinary people were killed.
Through this, the whole world understood what is the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony is not just a war.
From terrorism to climate change, economic development and social justice, it is necessary to work with each other in collaboration with the world.
The development of the poor in the poor is the real symbol of peace.
Dear countrymen, our North-Eastern region is different.
The natural beauty there is unparalleled and the people there are very talented.
Our North-Eastern region is now known for many sadnesses.
The North-Eastern region is very progressive in biodiversity, that is, organic farming.
A few days ago, Kirtiket Future Polysis Gold Award 2018 was achieved in promoting simultaneous learning.
Oh, that's food and aggressional organisation.
The reward for the best guidance in this sector is similar to Oscars in the region.
Moreover, our Sikkim state has been awarded 51 policies which have been named after 25 states.
Many congratulations to the people of Sikkim on this.
Dear Countrymen, the month of October is over.
There's a lot of change in weather.
Festivals are also in a way like Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhayaduj and Chhath.
As an opportunity to move forward in a mission mode in your life, your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
