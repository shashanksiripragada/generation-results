Its language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in language .
It is called ' turtle ' .
Although this is ' bid ' , it has its own script .
If you want to write the turban then you have to write in the Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where many times earthquake has come and all the city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jesus - Toral .
The story of Jessel - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same path that had come from then we will have to take a complete one month ' s holiday and on the other side we will go to school in Mumbai .
So what do you do  Now you will travel in the train by calling the fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of metre gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a small train towards metre gauge will reach Ahmadabad and a big train of broad gauge from Ahmadabad will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
Tourist business has been deeply shocked by the growing threats of trade slowdown and south Asia .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan to be succumbed to the major states of the country has been decreased properly these days .
The figures released recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has come down more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics the number of domestic tourists has come down 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has come down 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 deshi and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 domestic and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holde Makers says that global slowdown and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the limits of tourism for Rajasthan the recent years are excellent .
After 2008 this is the first time that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
From the point of view of tourism something new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , palaces , forests everything is the same ancient for enjoying the tourists .
In the tourism area all governments talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
Along with foreign palaces , tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of slaughter and storm have also blamed the image of this state internationally .
Years before Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of excitement in the state but it has remained confined to paper only .
One example of the functioning of Rajasthan Government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of inviting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic structure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed an RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are total 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motor , eight cavatories , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palace on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The deficiency of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lac which is estimated to be 632 lac in the year 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also making it a big loss .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attracted towards this rail .
Despite reducing the fare they could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years also a reduction has been seen in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair , this number decreased to 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC has been that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This rail is continuously benefitting .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of Rs . 9 . crore from this train .
With this declining in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the details of concerns in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the heart of a person then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it true by establishing the modern city Embo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahayadir of Maharashtra .
Those who had seen their dreams glitter in their eyes while walking day and night .
His happiness was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place as an excellent city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres only on 9 percent ground hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available .
On 91 percent ground trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
To build their houses in this city built for only crorepatis many industrialists are coming forward and today around families are staying in this city .
Initially industrialists and residents bought their residence here as a recent home but now they have made it their first house and they travel to Mumbai for work from here .
Behind Ambe Valley itself is Korigarh Fort which provides beauty to this area .
In the western Siang district the ruins of Leekawali are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the pillars of stones of this temple the excavation of the statues of lotus and gods and goddesses has been done enough which is mostly in the broken state .
Malini Than is an important place in this very region .
On this spot a devotee statue of Devi Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are spread among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpalli are still singing the glorious songs of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamareshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of brass .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the glory of the goddess Tamareshwari is found .
During the time of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was recognised far and wide .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
There was sacrifice of mankind here which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
In Lohit district of Arunachal some more ruins have been found .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak city which are situated in the middle of the Debang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories present here this place is only ancient Vidarbha , where once King Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Degradu , Mismi etc . tribes here guide the tourists .
These people themselves also have great faith in this well .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Apart from the above mentioned ruins in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of the ponds of bricks near Roying are still telling their story .
Getting the ruins of bathing , straight stairs and a pond surrounded by a narrow crown and wide roads are still singing silently of our ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from North Lakhimpur city of upper Assam through jeep for four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lor Subansiri district .
At a height of about 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of the visitors .
This is the charming place where there are survivors .
It takes several days to reach here before the jeep becomes the way .
On reaching here the views of tall cedar trees , beautiful premrozes , vollet , wild curtains , strawberries and racebarese enjoy the visitors .
Apple and potatoes are produced here a lot .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the affected people .
With its uninterrupted hard work the people of the earthquake have made it their heaven .
Here the farming of rice is very much .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of its efficiency of labour and agriculture .
The need for their irrigation is finished from Kali river .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight is light redness emerging in the sky on the white in between the snow laden chains of the left hand .
Excellent cough in air is cold .
Along with the cold supplied in the environment one also feels the feeling of moisture .
From the sound of garbage - garbage below the feet one gets to see on the layer of the poles spread on the floor of the wood .
There is neerwat in the environment and due to the shadow of the dullness before sunrise there is not much visible .
The tablets stay on the redness of the eyes before .
There is a feeling of sitting on the bench lying in the balcony .
As soon as the hand is put the smooth layer of the eyelid gets scratched with the sound of a slight sound and the hand separates from the shock with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending nights coming in this small village settled amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both the sides of the thin balcony river is spread till far on the light slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Runn valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The parallel highway of the Run river and the vehicles shouting on it have begun to make clear .
The journey of 300 kms from the car and half an hour from the car , along with the equivalent to the Jeneva lake and half the Rohn river coming from the eastern direction along with Montro , Jeneva lake which is called Lake Lamas -LRB- Lake Lake Lama -RRB- is found in the middle .
100 kms long and 10 kms wide the western end of this lake Jeneva city is settled .
From there the lake again turns towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side there are mountain ranges of Dhaval , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the left side we come on the hilly path towards the north except this highway .
Due to the slope of the mountain being south - facing the sun of climbing is giving abundant sunlight to all the eyelids .
The quantity of snow is less here than the valley - almost not equal .
As we move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good cough snow being frozen on both the sides of the road due to clear sky and shining sun there is no special cold in the air .
On this curved hilly road after finishing a journey of about 20 kms in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
There are large multi-storeyed bungalows made of wood with rocky slopes .
There are rooms to control necessary services like electricity , water , ladder along with parking of trains in the basement made from the cement concrete of this bungalow of three storeys .
Switzerland is famous for the agriculture of grapes .
This wine is the main center of making wine wine wine .
37  of the entire canton is cultivated on the ground .
In villages settled on both the sides of the Run Valley grapes gardens give a unique dimension to its beauty .
Taking them under the gardens of grapes , touring them in the villages there night resting and drinking wine by carrying them into the markets of grapes are an inseparable part of tourism business here .
There is a very big collection of grapes in a room made in 12th century in a small town named Age , to see which foreign tourists have to get an arch booking .
Once again we pass through that jungle which was destroyed from Dewanal .
By the shouting words of children throughout the way for three - four kms the mind becomes even more irritable .
Suddenly a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene at a turn .
Just in front of the road on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
On the slope above the village people are skiing in snow .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope a dense forest of ' Mak Deodar ' is spread .
There is dense snow on all four sides .
The roofs of the houses of the colony are shining due to the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also there is silence .
From the peak of the mountain to the valley all around the kingdom of Dhauli Hima .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round chakra between that town .
The name of the town is Lukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Luckerabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants to stay here .
65 streams of hot water have been found in Lukarbad till now .
Out of these 40 lakh litres of hot 510 per day are transported to almost 30 thermal pools made at places in the entire town of water , some pools are inside the five star hotels and according to the pockets of different classes .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of warmth .
In the open sunshine on the roof of houses the thick layer of snow is sparkling .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the safest places in Switzerland as a heritage of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling that only sikkim taxis can be done therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are the same , the whole of the air is there .
On the whole of the body there is desert moisture .
In monsoon season charming light is the same .
The plan of Darjeeling journey is concrete . First of all the decision of the Jhakki of Karsiyang was taken .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunshine forests .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then initially the tea garden welcomes those who move towards itself while spreading smiles .
In the middle of tea gardens smaller than a road charms the heart in the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side is Hagiri Ghat .
Here sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
There was an empire of greenery all around .
Once I got scared , see these natural forests or plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful jungles , the more beautiful the tea gardens spread far .
If we go to the road then it looks very amazing .
As if the snakes were walking round and the busy path was passing .
Time was also passing .
If we were not passing then jungles and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are visible .
From a distance itself a hilly house - house etc . was seen very close .
This was Karsyang .
Staying here at one place we made the program of touring throughout the day .
Therefore taking a car we left on a tour of Karsiyang .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
To reach up to the climb i . . Deer Park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Besides being decorated with beauty Karsyang has not yet been developed as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite being desolate the path the desire to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road between dust trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated on the other side of the city at a height .
This is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the reign of the British lovers used to give life by jumping here .
At present , this is a park and a restaurant .
There is a staircase dome here whose height is a beautiful view on looking at the entire city .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea leaf running hands with a very loud speed on the back .
Carsyang is a museum outside the city , but on that day we could not go there because it was more necessary to roam free environment of tea gardens .
The next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was very worried by this that if such rains were happening then how would we tour .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On moving a little further down from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here the shape of waterfalls amidst rocks is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that in the empire of stones waterfalls are enchanted then the magnificent world of waterfalls is decorated with stones in the Ganges .
This place is very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
Walking up with the help of the vehicle we saw the sweeping lump in Darjeeling .
The entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope from here .
The taste of the weather was still clear .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , know where we arrived and started sneezing .
In the evening plan was made to roam on the road and shopping .
In the tour of Darjeeling Towy Trains give four moons in the journey .
The journey of Towy Train from Darjeeling to Dhum and Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here boating in Mirik lake and lunch in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans are available .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is just a city of Darjeeling district but its form - color is different .
Here is not the greenery of tea gardens but the movement of forests and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot -LRB- Lahaula and Lolegaon -RRB- , which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling in the shadow of winter , but the tea gardens spread here from Siliguri to Darjeeling bound me with you .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not foreign nor outside Rajasthan but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , then sometimes there is a special place , a ship of water or a royal train or a city like a pink city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of this special attraction people come dragging .
The place where I am going to talk this bus has been ready about four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come there has actually made it magic in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears the words of my guide Ram Babu Meena resonate , sir , before this we could not even think that we could stay like this in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt that these local people did not get work even in the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu resident of Ajabgarh used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Amn Bagh .
He has turned himself into a new color .
Saheb ' is the style of Amn Bagh .
There no one calls you in English .
Amn Bagh is actually a tourist spot with infinite peace and all the comforts .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also makes it from your well-known areas nearby .
In the royal style of Rajasthan how many of the people spending holidays would have toured Bhawangarh of the past , why should go far , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchek might have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Amn Bagh big people from the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Ajmi had called me there with a loud voice but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he had reached Bhangagarh by wandering through his own way .
This time I suddenly reached there on the gift of my foreign guest , then felt that those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time they should definitely go to Amn Bagh .
This garden is the only garden surviving from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stop to hunt .
Its construction was done in twenty one and a half .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Amn Bagh surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees hypnotise you .
As soon as you come inside the way you are welcomed , it feels from that only that the attention has been given to the divine peace here .
With the binding of Mauli in Kalai the mantra of Mangalacharan is encouraged alive .
We had reached the slope in the evening we intended to put a cycle on that garden .
Like my messenger , who is calling , suddenly said , This is interesting .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new and artistic has not been surprised that Amn Bagh has also got a reward recently .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhahangarh .
While walking on a road like a crooked road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers were harvesting .
This year it was not rainy but for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
If for this then such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a traveller from Holland sitting in deep concentration .
This is a million dollar unmatched moment .
The way to say goodbye to Amn Bagh was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they left us .
Now we realized why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing tribe life .
Is this right
Of course this happens not only in many states but tourists also show interest in coughing in them .
These tours are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It includes staying there , eating etc .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there has not been much development and there has not been a special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this the old tourist sites etc . are also present here .
Besides this , attention is also given to doing triditional cousin survey .
Actually the goal of such a tour is to be done by the tourists in the manner and traditions of living in that place .
Although it looks a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
Besides being with many people you can enjoy touring alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a long time without being distracted .
Yes , it is important that along with giving a lot of time for less expenditure and peace these tours definitely keep the demand of serbing from you .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching any foreign destination through bus tour .
Take the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of Military , children etc get discount on these , then for both people also there is an arrangement of discount .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in Advanced , therefore in the last moments it is better to do plaining a little before bus tour .
Instead of ticket you should know about the round trip .
This is cheap .
The rules are very strict on the bags , therefore ask about the size and weight of the goods .
There should not be any such thing that you have to leave some things on the terminal or you have to pay extra fee .
Also know the rules of insurance or loss compensation with tour company .
Carry on bags are good , but lets go .
Because they get fit in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during the tour the details of the goods will be yours .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the Biggy season you should take special care of this matter .
Actually as soon as you reach , you will have the best seat option .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the conferencing .
If you feel more sliding on the previous seat , then reading on the front seat is not conferable .
If you have to go to Lu again and again then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more distorted then the window seat will be better for you .
Now it is a matter of guilt .
If you go in the front of both the arms then sit on the corner seat first and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in bus , then planning will be done .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing as well while choosing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after a while .
Make identity with bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus all are asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat because on its disappearance the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , return back on time .
If you do not come on time then you can get a new tourist in your place and you have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

On the roads of Goa while enjoying cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and world famous Goan cuisines the Ginger hotel situated here is an excellent option to spend a comfortable day .
On looking at today 's look the cheapest rate of return from Delhi to Maldives is 28 thousand rupees per person .
After that if you stay in Malay then even then you can get hotels in a little rent but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will fall short .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Lui cruise from Kochi started the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Lui cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Lui Cruise has already dissolved its services , but from October it is expected to be recurred again .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person on the ship of Lui cruise Emvi Equiamirin .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If there are two elders then children below the age of 15 years are completely free .
What else is needed .
The rent of cruise includes tea - breakfast , food .
Enjoyment of all the time together .
After reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - From Plain Road to Underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a cycle is standing in front of you then you will feel like a toy .
But this town with 12 - 15 seats is excellent for touring Orchipelago -LRB- Island Group -RRB- like Oter Plane Maldives .
On the surface of water while running like a speed boat it emerges in the air , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes .
All the time your eyes keep looking at the lower islands while looking at the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them with which there are twenty - six planes .
If you want you can tour air for an hour in approximately thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or the whole of the plane can rent for your whole day .
Although if you go to any island beyond the Malley island then the journey of the sea plane will be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey whose desire to end is probably not to you .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the best -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and swineer shop of the capital in the Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All Salesman was listening to the speech given by the President Mohammad Nashid of Maldives in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier very carefully .
If you say honestly then no Indian has seen the speeches of the President or the Prime Minister listening so carefully .
But when there was only a question of the existence of an unparalleled creation of this earth then such seriousness was inevitable .
Many people may have considered the meeting made inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but after going to Maldives it feels as if if the nature 's anger will lose it with us then the world will be so rare .
Something is special in the beauty there .
In that small country it is as if it does not bring so much beauty .
To go back to his cruise from that tour of the market , when the eyes went to the sea water along with the Burbus circus then it was felt that the people here understand the price of this beauty to what extent .
The water was so clear that fish floating in many metres deep below the light of lamppost were clearly visible with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you can also see a few centimetres in the sea or water of the river associated with any city of India then you will consider yourself lucky .
While returning to MV Aquamirin we were roaming around in the mind for two hours in the evening spent in the lake .
Koral Rif -LRB- Mountain rock -RRB- is the life here .
Even on stones on the tombs you will get to see pearl rocks .
Just a while before listening to President Nasheed ' s speech we were standing outside his government residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the best person of any country , there was no security guard till far .
With fun we were pulling the photographs of gardens and rings just fifty metres away by increasing the hand inside the gate of its bungalow .
That you can think about the house of such a leader in India .
It was also known that the President sometimes crossing the road on foot both the blocks reach their office ahead .
Everything about Maldives was amazing .
Therefore I was waiting for the next day ' s vasbri .
It seemed as if that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to airport Island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives while cutting a round of ruins .
Last evening when the cruise was approaching the Malay then we were passing through the top and immediately recognized the plane .
Such pictures which had been seen , are of them .
But then we did not know that the next day we would get the opportunity to ride in it .
We were going to go to Rangali island a hundred and five kilometres away from the scene of Trans Maldives .
It was amazing to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the plane flying till a height of approximately thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
He was an expedition to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But after reaching Kornad Resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island we felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no residence from any outside world .
The dweller was not even like this that it was difficult to get out like beauty or valour from there .
Tour can also be done on foot or from the battery run car as well .
While going from Jetty to the main island the view of water life on both the sides of the bridge was amazing .
Now we could not even make ourselves simple from the nature around , that reached such a place , was timeless .
While descending in the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all sides crossing the glass we could see miraculous types of small - big fishes , courses , snow climbing and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
On coming to this island from Male to Sea Plane the fare of seeing it and taking underwater lunch is only Rs . 47 thousand for a person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to bow in our passport water .
But we knew it was not possible .
Returned with this hope with a heavy heart that sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , you will surely bring the ' destination ' on some turn .
For many days they were planning to go out of Delhi but due to evening arrangement this was not possible .
From childhood the wildlife was a hustle-bustle then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour in 2006 after biking up from Khardungla pass till Pegong lake .
On the morning of 27 December we departed from Delhi to Jim Corbett , but the excitement with which Kore had emerged turned our weekly Rafoo .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Kora from above and bad road ahead .
Many times we felt that we fell now .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
On that day there was no special program but despite being cold we first went to roam the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there came out the Corbett Museum , which was very difficult at a distance of two kilometres near Dhangri Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It became quite evening while returning .
It was clear from Delhi that if you would definitely see a lion roaming freely in the jungle then I would keep looking at the lions all night .
Suddenly in the midst of the depths of the night I heard a loud noise and after that the dogs who began to sneeze were not silent for two hours .
Therefore first there was a suggestion of touring Kaladungi and Corbett Fall .
Kaladungi is thirty kms away , while carbonate falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladungi where some special things related to his personal life are kept .
On returning we got twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled on coming in this village itself .
On reaching Resort the journeyer Jeepsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged for sighting in the number one site Bijrani there .
Asked about number one Grasland is more there and tigers come on that side only to escape from cold during this period .
As soon as we reached Bijarani a guide was given , which takes two and a half hundred rupees to rotate for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw several species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tight elephants , whose long teeth were .
I roamed and photographed .
In between the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are tigers around 150 in the park , some of which have died recently .
In many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad because of not getting the view of the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a tiger ride in my mind .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I took her in the same way .
I told her that I have come to the carbonate .
He asked whether he saw the tiger or not .
This word of her smelled like a teer .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take a ride inside .
During the journey it was found that due to being a highway near the park often animals get wounded by cars or die .
