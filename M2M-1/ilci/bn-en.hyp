Its language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes, it's different.
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore in language also there are two mixtures .
This language is called Kachhi .
Although there is no script of this language .
If you want to write Kachhi then you will have to write it in Gujarati script only .
The Anjar city is situated near the ground where many times earthquake took place and the entire city was destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near Anjar itself .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very thrilling .
If we want to return through that route then we will have to take a second month ' s holiday and on the other side we will open school in Bombay .
Then what can be done  This time we will travel by train by moving fast buses of Gujarat .
From Bhuj the small train of metre gauge reaches Rajkot .

The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through very bad situations today .
Due to the dangers of increasing terror in Manda and South Asia there has been a deep impact on tourism business .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to visit Rajasthan counted among the major states of the country has been seen very less .
According to the recent figures of Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is 10 percent less than 2008 .
According to the number the number of national tourists is 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent less .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were compared to two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists in Rajasthan .
Of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were there .
People associated with tourism sector are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of the Makers in Rajputana Holidays says that due to business depression and accidents tourism business has been very badly affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong based framework in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 229 percent in comparison to last year .
In foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is the highest .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism this year has spent a lot .
After 2000 this time the number of tourists of Rajasthan has decreased for the first time .
From the point of view of tourism nothing is happening .
Desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forests , everything has been kept in ancient times for tourists .
To work on rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism in the field of tourism all the governments have increased but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get less chance .
The incident of rape and disturbances happening in Rajasthan with foreign tourists has also worsened the pictures of this state internationally .
Rajasthan government had given tourism industry in the state several years ago but it was limited to paper only .
One example of success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the structure of tourism the government of Rajasthan formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities like housing , food , travel , boating etc .
There are a total of 75 units in this Nigam .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 mottles , eight cattle , three passengers , one passenger single and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels , but the situation of this corporation has been worsened for a few years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakhs which is estimated to be 632 lakhs in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this corporation is such that in the last five years forty percent rooms of this hotel are also not filled .
Along with the hotel other units of Nigam have also been faced with great destruction .
Among these the main is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There is no attraction of tourists towards this railway .
Even after reducing the fares it has not been able to attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of the tourists towards the Pushkar Fair has been seen less .
In 2007 - 08 the tourist village built with the point of view of RTDC in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed this year the number has decreased to 217 .
The satisfactory point of RTDC is that there has been some dearth of attraction for tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal trains .
Due to this rail there is relief .
In the past year RTDC has got the benefit of Rs . 9 . crore from this railway .
In the areas of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to get disturbed by this loss .
Tourism is the biggest source of Rajasthan economy .
If there is a desire to do something in the mind of the person then he can make gold from the ground .

The sight also falls towards the light lama rising in the hungry sky amidst the snow laden mountain ranges on the left side .
The wind is very cold .
In the weather along with winters one feels humidity also .
Beneath the trees , the surroundings of the pulses spread on the wooden boards are heard by the sound of the squirrel .
Because of humidity in the weather and humidity before sunrise nothing is seen more .
The sight sticks on the lama of the east .
They wish to sit on the bench kept in Baranda .

Thousands of miles away from their country amidst these snow laden mountains of Switzerland this is the first experience of spending nights in this small village .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this he spent more time encouraging or around it .
Situated on both the sides of the river the dense populace is spread till far above the light slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland , the valley of Roin , on both sides of which are many small and big cities .
Trains are clearly visible on the highway and road along the Roon river .
Half an hour ' s journey by car and 300 kms is similar to the Geneva lake and the Rohn river coming from east along with half the Rohn river , which is called French lake lama .
100 kms long and 10 kms wide this lake is situated the Geneva city on the western bank of this lake .
The lake here again passes towards the west through river .
Dhaval , Gangnachumbi Alps mountain ranges across Daiyi and Lakes .
After crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we left the highway and reached the hilly path in the north .
Due to the slopes of the mountains being south facing the sun gives a lot of sunshine in the afternoon .
In comparison to the valleys the quantity of snow here is almost not less .
As much as the height goes towards it the density of snow increases .
Despite good snow being frozen on both the sides of the road due to clear sky and shining sun the wind does not get special cold .
We reached a small village called Thal after completing a journey of about 20 k . . on this rotten hilly road in half an hour .
Shail . This is a large multi-storied bungalow made of full wood with slope roofs .
Along with the arrangement of lodging of cars in the basement made of this bunker cement concrete of three storeys there are also rooms to control necessary services like cart , water , lunch etc .
Switzerland is famous for grapes .
It is the main center of wine - grapes making wine .
Grapes are grown on 37  of the entire cantonment terrain .
The grapes garden in the village situated on both the sides of the Roon Valley provides a unique aspect of its beauty .
Taking to the grapes garden , moving around , taking rest at night in the villages there and taking into the factory making wine of grapes is an integral part of the tourism business here .
There is a large museum of grapes in a Pallivavan built in 12th century in a small town named earlier , to see which foreign tourists keep precious bookings .
Once again we are going through the jungles of the destruction of Bhasma in Dawan .
The road till three - four kms was becoming even worse in the question of children .
That is why the dramatic and charming change of the view comes in a turn .
Just ahead , there are many houses on the slopes above the deep valleys on the left side of the road .
People are skiing on the slope above the village .
On the skiing slope till the peak of the mountain the dense forests of cedar are spread .
There is dense snow on all four sides .
The roofs of the houses of the city are shining wearing the sun rays .
Within five minutes we reached the village .
This silence is spread here as well .
On all four sides from the peak of the mountain to the valleys is the kingdom of white snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big round chakra in the middle of that town .
The name of Kasbar is Liukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Liukarabad is approximately 1500 .
There are 1700 apartments and shawls with capacity of 6900 beds here , 28 hotels for staying in 1500 , camping site for tent leaves , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants we can estimate the number of tourists , sportspersons and climbers coming here .

The name of this village is Albenin .

It was said in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to the taxis therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is different , but the hills are the same , the trees and the winds are also the same .
The moisture in the whole body is also one .
Brightness in the season of monsoon is also one .
On the completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey it is decided to take the Jhansi of Karsiyang first .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens full of smoke jungles .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then the tea gardens first welcome you in a joyous manner .
In the middle of tea gardens on going through the road for the first time the heart became enchanted .
On one side green mountains laden with forests and on the other side deep green valleys .
Here sometimes forests and tea gardens are seen .
On all four sides is the kingdom of greenery .
Once we had fallen in difficulty - we will not see these natural forests the trees of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beauty of the jungle was as beautiful as the tea gardens spread .
On looking at the road the creation looks strange .
Trees like snake rice and turned roads were going on .
Time was also going on .
What was not spent is forests and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
A lot of density was seen from a distance , a hilly house , etc .
This was Karsiyang .
Standing here at one place we made a program of tourism throughout the day .
So we went out to tour Karsiyang with a car .
First of all diar park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
The front was spread i . . to reach the deer park we had to leave the car far below .
Despite being full of beauty Karsiyang has not yet been developed or famous as tourist spots .
Although the city is very clean .
Despite being desolate from the roads the joy of trekking between the loving and dust trees reaching till the deer park surrounded by the jungle was giving us the joy .
The next place was eagle crag .
On the other side of this city is a point situated at a height .
It is called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to commit suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected with a park and restaurant .
There is a dome here from which the entire city can be viewed beautifully .
In the tea gardens nearby women are capable of applying tea on the back with a basket at a very fast speed .
There is a museum outside Karsiyang city , but on that day we could not go there because in tea gardens roaming around the open weather looks very important .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
This place was very thrilling but it was more worried than that how would we roam when there was such rains .
But the connectivity was very good that by reaching till Rock Garden we could enjoy the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The road reaching till here is even more charming than this .
Going a little below from here you will find Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst stones the shadows of the springs are worth seeing .
We got to see in Rock Garden that waterfalls are enchanted here in the rock empire and the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with stones .
These two places are present in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
On climbing up by car we saw the Vatasia Loop in Darjeeling .
From here the entire hills and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The weather spectacles were still good .
But as we moved towards the monastery knows from where the clouds came and started shining .
In the evening plans for walking and shopping are made in Malrod .
Toy train journey in Darjeeling makes it even more attractive .
The journey of Toy Train from Darjeeling to sleep and from Dorjeeling to Toy Train is a special attraction for the tourists .
There is a little rest in boating and garden in Miric lake here .
On this route only tourists go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where sweets etc . made by Nepali artisans are available .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is like a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but the voice of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lola and Lolehgaon , which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in winters but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me in their own way .
One of my recent journeys was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan , was very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a thrilling thing in which sometimes journey attracts us and sometimes like a special place , a ship or a royal train or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where I am going to say is built almost four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has been built it is really worth seeing in the jungles .
Not only those who go there but also those who stay there for them .
In my ears still my guide Ram Babu Mina ' Sahiba had never been able to think before that that I could stay in my jungle in such a way .
Fifty percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I realized that such local people did not get work even in Heritage hotels .
Ram Babu resident of Azamgarh used to work in Jaipur earlier and now this royal amazing garden .
He has created a new way in a different structure .
Sahiba is an idea of Aman Bagh .
There nobody communicates you in English .
Aman Bagh is really a peaceful and comfortable place .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is also introduced to the nearby areas .
The people who spend holidays royally in Rajasthan who have roamed around in Bhangagarh in many of them , there is no need to go away , even among the people of Jaipur , probably few people have spent night in this area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana Ajmi invited me there but I could not go .
This is a different fact that he had reached Bhangarh by mistakening his own road .
This time I suddenly reached there to invite my foreign guest , feeling that those who want to spend a good holiday for a short time should go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is one of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to rest for hunting .
It was constructed in 19th or 20th century .
Its old walls are witness to those days .
The first sight of Aman Bagh surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees will hypnotise you .
The way you enter inside the way you will be welcomed it will be felt that divine peace is taken into consideration here .
The mantra of Mangalacher is pronounced alive with the Mauli bandage of the hand .
We reached in the evening and we decided to set up a cycle of garden .
My Majesty 's sister Jackie said with a decorative ' it 's very charming ' .
Everything is inspired from the palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is the light of this place .
Everything is new and artistic . It is not surprising that Aman Bagh has been rewarded recently .
The manager had fixed our program for the morning .
First of all roamed on foot with Ram Babu and then roamed around by the jeep of Bhangarh .
While walking on the road of Kankar we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw Sukhi lake in which farmers are harvesting .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the production of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life was very enjoyable for Jackie .
After this we went to Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep concentration .
It's a million dollars.
While coming out of Aman Bagh they told us by eating our jaggery and curd in traditional drums .
Now we got to know why tourists come here spending so much .
I heard that tour packages are also made to see the lives of tribals .
Is this right
Of course this is done not only in many states but tourists also give special encouragement in this journey .
This tour is generally made for four days to two weeks and this time tourists are taken to different places .
Among these staying there , eating etc . are also included .
In this way attempts are made to tour places where there is not much development and there is no special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and humans .
Along with this old tourist site etc . are also there .
Besides this concentration is also given to feeding .
Actually the purpose of this kind of tour is to confront the custom and tradition of the tourists at all these places .
Although it feels a little difficult to think but such tours are really thrilling and a different kind of experience .
Touring by bus is a different joy .
Despite staying with many you can enjoy staying alone .
Not only this in this journey you can read your favorite books for a long time without obstacle .
Yes , it is right that along with spending a lot of time in less cost and peace this tour makes you all claim .
To enjoy this tour it is important to remember some things especially when you are touring some foreign place by bus .
Find the best deal before taking tickets .
Students , elderly people of the military , children etc . get rid of this tour , and for both there is arrangement of hijacking .
Although buying tickets beforehand is a little cheap therefore in the end it is better to do bus tour than planned .
Instead of taking tickets on both sides get information about round trips .
This is cheap .
Regulations related to commodity are made specially therefore ask about the quantity and weight of commodity .
It does not happen that you have to leave your luggage on the terminal or get a bigger fare .
Along with this you should also know the rules of insurance or loss from tour company .
Take the fare on bags appropriate for this tour .
Because it sticks to the top of the seat .
This thing should be kept in mind that while changing the bus at the time of tour you will have the responsibility of the goods .
From where you will come to the bus you will reach it one hour before the scheduled time .
You should keep this in mind especially during busy season .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will find a better seating place .
Keep in mind the rest while choosing the seat .
There is more narrowness in the back and not able to fall properly towards the front .
If you go to the bedroom again and again then take the place towards which , if you do not like to be more disturbed then it would be better if you take a seat towards the window .
Now there is a talk of a walker .
If you are both trying to wink then first put your bag in the adjacent seat sitting in the corners .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this project will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then remember this thing while selecting the seat because after some time sitting there becomes difficult .
Apply to bus driver or conductor .
By this you will get to know many important information .
Everyone is called to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time you will not leave your luggage in the place because if you lose it the buses do not take care of it .
Wherever the bus stops , return at the right time .
If you do not have time then you can take a new passenger in your place and you have to wait for other buses in the terminal .

On reaching the capital Mall you can enjoy entertainment , activities according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming around the big airplanes you will suddenly feel that if a plane is standing in front of you then it will be a toy .
But this twin woter plane with 12 - 15 seated places is the best for the tour of a group of islands like Maldives .
We can not even know when we fly like a speed boat on the water suddenly gets up in the air .
On the whole of the flight you will get the experience of roaming in normal airplanes .
You will always be seen below - in the water of various kinds of blue colors of Maldives the resort islands and the Prawal islands are worth seeing .
Everything looks so clear .
There are two Si planes in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these which has twenty-six planes .
If you want then you can roam around 4 thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- in an hour or you can roam the whole of the plane for roaming around the day -LRB- for that you must have the strength of the tax -RRB- .
If you go to any other island from Male island then the journey of the C plane will be necessary because that is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never want to end .
The journey of C plane from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavilavaru -RRB- is done on the island of Maldives .
We were in the biggest Antique and Suvenier shops of the capital in the Ahmadine Bazar of Mall .
A day before by the President Mohammed Nashis of all the Salesman Maldives he had heard the description of the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen very carefully .
In fact I did not see the speech of the President or the Prime Minister in any Hindustani so much consciously .
But when the question of creation of a new existence arises on this soil then it is necessary to be so serious .
Many people will go to Maldives even after taking a meeting tower done under the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , it will be felt if the nature ' s wrath snatched it from us then the world will become so poor .
There is a different kind of speciality in the beauty there .
This small country does not look so beautiful .
While going to the jetty to return to the cruise from that tour of the market when the people here understood how much the price of this beauty can be understood by going towards the sea water walking on the road again and again .
The water is so clear that colorful fish are seen in the light of lamppost a few metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you get to see a few centimetres clearly in the sea or water of the river connected with any city of India then you are fortunate .
The evening spent in Malay to come to Amby Aquamin was spent two hours in the evening .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get a crown on crematorium .
Just a while before listening to the speech of President Nashis we were standing outside his government residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the house of the highest personality of any country , no security personnel could be seen far and wide .
We were funny putting the pots of the garden just fifty metres away by enhancing the hand inside the gates of its bunker .
Can you think about the houses of a leader in India
It was also known that both the blocks first went to their office after crossing the road on foot .
Everything has been exhibited about Maldives .
That is why we were waiting for the next day brass .
It seems that this day will be special .
In the morning we took a boat from cruise and took it to the airport island .
From there we reached the Trans Maldives base by cutting the chakra of the Ranway .
The next day when we reached near the cruise mall in the evening then we got to know the flight going up immediately .
We saw a lot of pictures .
But then did you know that the next day you will get the opportunity to ride on this plane .
We were going to Rangoli Island situated at a distance of five kilometres from Trans Maldives 's C plane .
Thousands of resorts and Koral islands spread over the sea of Maldives through this sea plane at a height of approximately thousand metres are unforgettable .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
With thrill and enthusiasm breathing was a flight like a stop .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotel on Rangoli Island we felt as if we had come to some other world .
In a world which has no relation with the outside world .
There was no such relation that the beauty and beauty found here is difficult to get out .
Cannada can be toured on foot or in a battery driven car .
From Jetty till the main island the view of water life on both the sides of the bridge was amazing .
Even today we could not get up with the nature around , we reached such a place which was unimaginable .
After getting down several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was under the water .
This room was actually the food hall .
On all sides of the glass , small - big fish , coral , snorkeling and scuba diving people were seen .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated floor there is very thrilling .
On coming from Male to Plains on this island it is worth seeing and for lunch of underwater the fare is 47 thousand rupees per person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to wear our passport in water .
But I knew that this was not possible .
Returned with the hope that sometimes , sometimes , fate will definitely bring here .
For a long time I was planning to go out of Delhi but because of the busyness of work it was not possible .
Children were very fond of wild life , so thought that this time we should go to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 before the Khardungla pass in Ladakh it was the second bike tour after biking till Peng Lake .
On 27th December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the excitement that I took out had reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajrola was very tiring .
On that again the path of evil and evil .
Many times it seemed as if we were falling .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Tikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
There was no special program that day , despite being cold we went to the coast of Kosi first .
After staying there for two - three hours we left for the Corbett museum which was near the Gangdi gate two kilometres away .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
After returning we went to the evening .
I had come out firmly from Delhi that I would definitely see the tiger roaming in the jungle but I saw the tiger all night in dreams .
Suddenly I could hear the sound in the deep of the night and then the dog which started crying began to walk for two hours .
First a suggestion was received to visit Kaldungi and Corbett fruits .
Located at a distance of thirty kilometres Kaladungi , Corbett falls on the road itself .
In Kaladungi there is a demonstration house of Jim Corbett Sahib , where some special things related to his life are kept .
After returning we got twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this village only .
After reaching the resort the safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they had arranged for sight-sitting in SAT BERNI .
It is said about number one that more grass is there and the tigers come here to save themselves from cold .
On reaching Vizrani one of our guides is given that for roaming around four hours we will get half a hundred rupees .
We stayed inside for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two teeth of elephants , whose long teeth were .
I picked up the photographs .
In between guides started trekking tigers .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park , many of which have died in a few days .
At many places we saw the marks of the legs of the tiger , but on not seeing the sight of the tiger the heart was deteriorating .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
The ghost of the tiger was suppressed on my head .
Then I remember an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him like this .
I told her that the Corbett came.
He asked if he saw the tiger or not.
His word was tied like a shore .
I said slowly that I didn't see it.
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
One of us told us to take safari for roaming inside .
