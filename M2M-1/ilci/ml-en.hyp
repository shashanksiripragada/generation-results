The tourism department considered to be the main source of economic situation of Rajasthan is passing through bad governance at this time .
In Vaishik Mandir and South Asia there is a serious obstacle in the attempt industry with increasing dangers .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan during these days is particularly less .
It has been said that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the recent past year 2009 has been less than 10 percent in comparison to 2008 .
In comparison to tourism the number of tourists in the country decreased by 98 . percent and foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 together in Rajasthan two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists are included because between 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 thousand tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countries and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with the tourist area think of this situation very well .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajput Holiday Meccर्स , says that serious incidents like Vaishik Mandir have adverse effects on tourism industry .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strengthening and basic stir of our tourism here .
This is the reason that in comparison to the number of foreign tourists coming to India there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Most of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the highest .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The attention of tourism is being improved throughout the year towards Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , big palaces , forts , wells , forests all are old , to surprise the tourists .
In the tourist spot all the governments are descending to work in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism and adventurous tourism but do not do anything in this direction .
The facilities of travellers coming to Rajasthan are available very little .
At the same time along with foreign tourists the pictures of this country have been decorated internationally in recent times in Rajasthan with artificial and provocative events .
Years before the Rajasthan government there was a crack in the tourism department in the state but it was stuck in newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government with regard to tourism .
With the aim of enhancing tourism and developing the basic stir of tourism the Rajasthan government has formed an RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of stay , food , cuisine , boating etc . for tourists .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Of them 39 hotels , 22 hotels , eight caves , three boards , one boarding unit and two train palaces on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the situation of this city office has been deteriorating for several years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 is 185 lakh and in the next year in 2009 - 10 it is estimated to be 63 lakh .
The condition of the hotels of this city office is this that within the last five years the rooms of its hotels are not filled with fourteen square metres .
Along with the hotels other units of the city also make it a big loss .
Among these Royal Rajasthan of Hills are the main .
There is no attraction for the tourists towards this train .
Because of the reason of a small rent it does not attract tourists .
During such a situation the interest of travellers towards Pushkar Fair is also seen decreasing .
In 2007 - 08 this fair was built by RTDC in the tourist village where 398 foreign tourists stayed and this year its number decreased to 217 .
In the middle of all this the joyful thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of the attraction of the tourists of Palace on Hills and Shahi train .
This train provides continuous benefits .
Last year RTDC had a profit of nine crore rupees from this train .
From this mountain coming to the tourist spot of Rajasthan it is natural to see the delusions of doubt in the tourist spot .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economic situation of Rajasthan .
If one feels the desire to do something in the mind then he starts making gold from the earth .
In the mountain range of Sahyadri of Subradrai Maharashtra situated in the modern city Embow Valley it can be really seen .

Initially industrialists and roses bought their birds in the form of a holiday house here , but now it has also turned into their first house and there was also a hustle-bustle of Bombay -LRB- Kushan -RRB- for employment from here .
Behind Amba Valley is Koyarigarh Fort which provides beauty to this region .

Between the snow laden mountain ranges on the left side the eyes fell on the thin Aurobindo rising in the sky of the cyclone .
The wind is very cold .
One also knows the moisture along with the cooling of the earth from the environment .
Below the legs looks at the angles of the snow falling at the end of the wooden sound .
The atmosphere is silent , because there is no more light before sunrise .
The eyes fell towards the aroma of the East .
It feels like sitting on a bunch of balcony .
As soon as the handicappedness is lifted up in the thin slope of the snow like a straw and the hand is dragged immediately when it feels cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , spending the night in this small village settled amidst the snow laden mountains of Switzerland this is my third foreign dwelling in life .

Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk we reached the Northern mountainous path by observing this highway on the right side .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not equal .

As the mood rises upwards the sensitivity of the snow increases .
On both the sides of the road due to the transformation of good sea and the clear sky and the shining sun there is no cold of the wind .
We reached a small village named Thal after making a journey of approximately 20 k . . on this Khumavadhar mountainous road in half an hour .
There are big and big two storied slopes made of wood on the sloping roof of the stones .
On the basis of the cement concrete made of this three storied palace there is also a division of controlling the requirements like electricity , water , cooking , along with the parking of trains .
The nearest airport from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is Karipur International Airport .
It is the main center of wine making grapes .
37 percent of the entire mountain is the farming of grapes in the earth .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Roon Valley the grapes gardens give a marvellous expanse to its beauty .
Go to the area with grapes gardens , travel where you can rest at night in the villages and go to the factories of grapes and try it , all these are the whole of the tourism industry here .
There is a huge collection of grapes in a fort built in 12th century in a small town named Aizawl which foreign tourists book beforehand .
Once again our people passed through that dense forest .
The whole of the road for three - four kilometres is disturbed by the questions of the climbing up of the children .
Suddenly with a curved sight , the dramatic and beautiful changes are made .
Just near the left side of the road in the upper part of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is present .
In the top of the villages people ski skiing is done on snow .
The dense forest of Deodar is spread till the peaks of the mountain above the skiing slope .
On all four sides heavy motions start falling .
The roofs of houses brighten due to the falling of the direct rays of the sun .
Within five minutes we reached the village .
Here also the same silence is shadowed .
All around from the peak of the mountain to the peak a beautiful snow synonym .
Within the next five minutes we reached a big round between that small town .
The name of the small town is Lukur Bad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Luckerabad is approximately 1500 .

It is said in Darjeeling that only simultaneous taxis go in Sikkim therefore the test is not done .
The journey is continuing , the region is another , but the mountain is the same .
The shivering cold of the whole body is the same .
The black color of the rainy season is also mine .
When the plan of Darjeeling journey was confirmed then it was decided to see the view of Karzeeang first .
Carsying is a small town in Darjeeling.
Full of tea gardens and dense forests are full of dense forests .
Excellent tea is famous for producing .
On getting off from Siliguri to Darjeeling the tea gardens in the beginning start laughing and welcoming those who come there .
On passing through the roads amidst tea gardens charming the heart for the first time , is one of the safest places in the form of wealth .
On one side the green mountain full of jungles on the other side is a deep green trench .
If there are forests here sometimes tea gardens can be seen .
All around is the kingdom of greenery .
Once I am confused that these natural forests can be seen or the plants of tea planted by humans .
Both are attracted towards themselves .
The beautiful jungles are as beautiful as the tea gardens are spread .
If the eyes go on the roads of the road then the creation wonders .
Going through the serpentine size of the serpentine and circular path .
Time also passes .
The jungles and tea gardens are not over .
Sometimes small houses are seen .
From a distance itself one gets to see extremely desert from houses and buildings on a mountain .
This is Carciang.
Staying at a place here we prepared a program of touring throughout the day .
That is , if you take a car and get out of the car .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
On climbing up , to reach the deer park the train gets down very much .
After being surrounded by the beauty of Karsianga it has not yet emerged as a tourist destination .
Because the city is so good and clean .
The desire to reach the deer park surrounded by the jungles and the joy of climbing the path between the trees of the sun gives us adventure .
Nearest place is Igel Craig .
This is a point situated on the other side of the city at a height .
This is called suicide point ' .
During the period of the British , the competitors used to pass through here .
Hilhaul , this is a park and a restaurant .
There is a stairs of fort here , from above which viewing the entire city beautiful scenes can be seen .
In the tea garden nearby women swallow the leaves of tea with their hands very fast .
There is a museum outside Karsiyang city but on that day we did not go there because it was more necessary to travel through the open environment of tea gardens .
The next day we decided to roam in Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience for me , but there was a lot of thought about how to roam around when it rained .
But honesty was very good that after reaching Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
On getting down a little from here we saw the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
Here in the midst of rocks the deer of the waterfalls can be seen .
In Rock Garden we can see a marvellous world of waterfalls in Ganga Maa while shining in the rocks and rocky empire here .
These two places are situated in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
By climbing up with the help of the vehicle we saw unparalleled scenes in Darjeeling .
With the help of a television from here all the mountains of Darjeeling can be seen .
The weather remains clear till date .
But if we climb to Monastery then we can see the clouds setting up .
In the evening somewhere or the other shines and glows .
During the journey of Darjeeling tower trains are also enjoyed .
Travelling from Darjeeling to Dhum and Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction of the tourists .
Here boating in Mirk lake and a little rest in the garden .
On this way tourists go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where the hand made and sweater of Nepali architects are available .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling but its shape and color are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because there is a residence of forests , waterfalls and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot , Lava and Lolegaon which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we did not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Calcutta to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of winter but the tea gardens spread from Siligui to Darjeeling here connected me towards itself .
In my condition a small journey is very thrilling and thrilling .
This journey is not foreign but outside Rajasthan because it is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing for me , in which a journey attracts me , but sometimes some specific places like water ships or any royal train or some town like Gulabi city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where you went to work was prepared about four and a half years ago , but with those preparations this place came there they really enjoyed Mangal .
Not only for those going there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears the voice of my guide Raman Babumina shouts , the master did not think before that how we lived in the jungle .
Eighty percent workers are also in this area .
Suddenly -LRB- unexpectedly -RRB- I felt that people of such a place would not be able to work in the heritage hotel .
Raman Babu resident of Ajabgarh had earlier worked in Jaipur , now in the Amn Garden with this unique arch wall .
He is telling himself that he has turned into a new color .
The pillar of ' Jamman ' is the Amman Garden .
There no one will call you English .
Amn Garden is actually a thrilling hustle-bustle of every comfortable experience .
This garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that it is known only through the neighbouring areas .
How many people traveled to Dunag of the messengers , how to go far and some people from Jaipur dwell in this area sometimes spend night in this area .
After opening the Amal garden big people from the country and abroad come there .
Shaban Asmi called me there very lovingly but I did not go that night I remember .
Its behaviour is different which reached Danag after passing through itself .
This time I had come there in the invitation of our foreign guests unexpectedly , but those people had spent a passionate holiday in a few days where they would definitely go to the Amman Park .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar made a camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in 19th and 20th .
Its old walls are witnesses of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and is the testimony of dense trees .
As soon as you come inside you will welcome you , from which it feels as if you have taken care of the unequivocal peace here .
Along with binding the chariot in the manifestation the mantra of mangalalacharya should be kept active .
On reaching Ladakh in the evening we planned to roam around in this garden .
My guest Jackie hypnotises us as an adorned guy and a guy .
Everything is inspired by big palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
There is no surprise of everything new and artistic .
The manager prepared our program for breakfast .
First of all on foot journey with Raman Babu and then the jeep journey of Danag .
On walking through the road of Sankari we saw the fort of Ajabgarh , in which gradually the rays of the sun spread .
On seeing the dry lake the farmers harvest in it .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the farming of tobacco .
The beauty of the rural life of Jack is a unique experience .
After that we reached Danag in the jeep .
In the morning I kept looking at a tourist in Holland very carefully .
Millennium dollar is an invaluable moment .
The journey of the Amn Garden is the traditional way of giving blessings and giving ginger and curd he told us .
Now we understand why tourists come here spend so much .
I heard that there are tourist places to see the lives of the tribals as well .
Is this true
Beshak is not such a thing , it is in many countries and tourists are especially enjoying it .
This tour is generally prepared from four days to two weeks and in between this tourists are included in different places .
Where to stay in it food and food are included from there .
This way such places try to explore where there is not much development and there is no effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this ancient picnic spots are also there .
Besides this it also takes care of the distribution of traditional cuisines .
Actually the meaning of such a tourism is to understand the customs and customs of the tourists living in that area .
Although it is a little difficult to think , but such a tour is a pleasant and different kind of experience .
It 's a joy for us to go to the bus .
Because of being with many people you can enjoy touring alone .
Not only this , in this journey if you take your favorite book then you will get more time in trouble .
Yes , it is important that along with giving less expensive and full comfortable moments this tour is definitely asking for your tolerance .
To enjoy it keep in mind some things especially if you are seen by a foreign destination bus tour .
Before getting the ticket look for a good deal .
Students , big people of the army , children etc . get benefit from this , but for other people also they get deduction .
However , there is arrangement for tickets in advance , therefore in the last moment it is better to make arrangements for tour in the bus , but the arrangement should be done for some time .
However , there is arrangement for tickets in advance , therefore in the last moment it is better to make arrangements for tour in the bus , but the arrangement should be done for some time .
This is cheaper .
The routine taking the bag is very hard , therefore tell about the size and weight of the things .
Sometimes it does not happen that you have to leave some things in the terminal or else you have to pay more money .
Together with this one should know the rules for insurance and all the losses from the tour company .
Carry on bags should be kept minute and taken out .
Because on top of the hips rock bursts up .
This thing should also be kept in mind that while busing between the tour the responsibility of the goods is to be done .
From where you want to board the bus you should reach there one hour before .
During the nausea you should take special care of this matter .
Actually as soon as you reach , you will have to choose the best place .
While choosing hips keep in mind whether there is kafurt .
There is more stiffness in the back hips but reading sitting on the front hips is not kafurtable .
If you want warm climate many times then you can take the humidity of the sides but if you do not like to worry much then the humidity of the end is very good for you .
Then it is a matter of intelligence .
If you are both in anxiety to handle then put a bag on the waist after sitting on the waist on the front side .
If you are both in anxiety to handle then put a bag on the waist after sitting on the waist on the front side .
But if the bus is not more busy then the arrangement will be successful .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
In such a situation you will get enough information from them .
While cleaning the bus everybody wants to go out .
During this time do not leave your substances in narrowness , because if it is missing then the people of the bus do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever you stop the bus return back at the time .
If you do not come on time then your place will be available to some new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

Lui Cruise is not just an European institution but has been named in Cruise and hotel business .
But due to some difficulties Lui Cruise has stopped its services but the possibility of starting again from October remains .
The ship of Lui Cruise at the lowest rate you can go till the end of Maldives for three days at least 5850 rupees per person per night .
That is , for three days the cost of one person is less than Rs . 18,000 .
Otherwise if you are two people then the child of more than 15 years of age is totally good .
What else do you want
The cost of cruise includes tea - breakfast .
Then all the time sports .
On reaching the capital Mala you can enjoy the pleasure of fun and activities available on the Maldives - from sea plane journey to lunch amidst water .
After roaming in big airplanes you will feel that if an airplane comes in front of you suddenly then you will feel to be a toy .
Although the twelve-fifteen-seat television operators like Maldives are excellent in the deliberate way of touring the islands like Maldives .
When it floats like speed boat on the surface of the water then it can not be known .
In every flight you will not feel like a normal flight .
Your glimpse will always be below the reproductive organs - on different sides of the Maldives look at the resource islands and Koral islands in blue water .
Everything is clearly visible .
There are two types of airlines in Maldives .
Trongs are one of these on the Maldives , which have 20 sea planes .
If you want then you can take a flight of about 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- for hours or the entire C flight can be rented throughout the day -LRB- if you want to pay a cash full -RRB- .
If you are going to any other island from the Maldives then it is the best way to travel amidst different islands .
You will never feel this journey to stop .
The sea plane travels from 12 kms to 183 kms on Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and grand shop of Ahmadabad market of Mala .
Everyone staying in shopping tried very carefully in the Global Climate Conference held in Red Fort one day before the Maldives President Mohammed Nasheed .
In fact I have not seen any Hindustani as well as the president or the chief minister of the language so carefully .
But due to the question of the existence of a living creature remaining in an unforgettable part of this planet it is better to lose silence .
Many people call the conference going inside the water through the Maldives Cabinet in October , but while going to Maldives it feels that if the nature has despised it from us then the earth will be so strong .
There is also a speciality in the beauty there .
In that small country so much beauty can not be covered .
To go back to your cruise from that end of the market you will have to turn towards a hut , to know how much people understand this beauty by passing through the roads .
The water is so clean that fish swimming deeply beneath the light of Kalpakkad can be seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
If you are able to see a few kilometres of clean water in the sea or river related to any city of India .
M . . Akva returned to Marine and spent two hours in the evening at Mala was not clear .
Pavilions are the lives here .
Here you will get pavilions till stones on the tombs .
Just a while ago we had stayed outside his office to listen to the linguistic words of President Nasheed .
We did not believe that before the house of the best person of a country .
With great interest we took pictures of the garden and courtyard of the 50 miles square surrounded by cattle alone through the gate of his bungalow .
You can think like this before the house of a leader in India .
The president sometimes got to know that by walking on the road two blocks go to their office beyond .
Everything related to Maldives was changing towards one side .
Therefore I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
We reached the airport at Cruise in the morning .
From there we reached the place named Traums Maldives by roaming through the runway .
Last evening when we reached the Cruise Mall , we returned quickly .
Many pictures of it were seen .
But it was not known that the next side could travel in it .
We had to go to Rangoli Island 105 kilometres away through Trans Mall TV -LRB- TV -RRB- .
Several resorts and pavilions spread over the sea of Maldives are unforgettable .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
With thrill and ambition the journey of breathing was stopped .
But when we felt as if we had reached a different world in the Rangoli resort of Hilton Hotels of Rangoli island .
Another world that is unconnected with the outside world .
There was also anxiety of such beauty , magnificence and accomplishment .
Travelling in Karnad can be done on foot and on a car running in Battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was amazing .
Now we reached the place after taking ourselves from the nearby nature which was far away from thinking .
With the help of stairs we reached a glass chamber situated under the water just a few miles below the sea .
That room was actually a bowl .
On all sides humans doing small - big fish , pavilion , snorkelling , scuba diving etc . are also seen .
On thinking of eating food sitting in the decorated tables there it is thrilling to us .
The cost of seeing this island by flight from Mala and eating lunch under water is Rs . 47,000 .
There was no need to return from there .
We were ready to take out our passport in water .
But I knew it wasn't possible.
We went back to the belief that if we had a heavy destination then we could come here again .
For some days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to busy work this was not possible .
Since childhood wildlife was an excitement , we thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this is the second bike tour after skiing till Pagong lake in front of the Kardungla pass in Ladakh .
In the morning of 27th December we left for the goal of Jim Corbett from Delhi , but whichever Joshimath had left , the sea shore snow blocked our journey .
The journey between Hapur and Gajoda was very difficult .
Clouded ice from the top and rod in front
Sometimes it seems to have fallen.
One way we reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in Dikuli near our resort park , whose booking was done before .
There was no special program , but despite winters we went walking on the sides of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to Corbett museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
On returning Ratri was very late .
On coming from Delhi it was decided that lions roaming freely in the jungle would definitely be seen and I had a lion around in dreams throughout the night .
In the midst of the darkness of the night I heard a deep roar , after which till 2 o'clock the tables were not closed .
The first opinion was to visit Kalabhangi or Corbett waterfall .
Kalbhangi is 30 kms away but the way to go to Corbett waterfalls .
Several items related to his life have been discovered in the museum of Corbett Saheb of Kalbhangi .
It's 12.30 in the night when it comes back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett has started reaching this village .
When we reached the resort then the safari gypsy was shivering us .
He had arranged the arrangements for sighting in the front of Bijrani there .
When asked about the first number , it was said that due to excess of grass grass there the leopard had come here to save from cold .
As soon as we reached Bijrani we gave us a guide .
We prepared for the forest inside .
We prepared for the forest inside .
Inside we saw two tucker elephants whose horns were very big .
I took a lot of pictures.
In the meantime, the guidance began to find the way to the tiger.
Guide said that there are only 150 tigers in the park , some of which died today .
At some places we saw the marks of their nails but we were sad because they were unable to see them .
On the third day we had to stay towards Delhi .
In my thought the entire tiger was safari .
Then I remembered an old friend in Haldani .
I just called him.
I told you I was coming to the Corbett.
He asked me whether I could see the tiger or not .
These words of him were supposed to be stupid .
I said slowly, no
There was no permission to bring a bike in the park.
Someone advised me to make you ride inside.
