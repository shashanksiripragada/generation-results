Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , different .
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side Gujarat therefore in the language also there is a mix of two .
This language is called Kunchy .
Although there is no script of this language .
If you want to write the book then you will have to write it in Gujarati script only .
The Anjar city is situated near the ground where many times earthquakes occurred and the entire city was destroyed .

Tourist industry , considered to be the main source of economy of Rajasthan , is now going through very bad situations .
Due to the danger of adverse effects in Manda and South Asia there has been a deep impact on tourism business .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to visit Rajasthan counted among the major states of the country has been seen very less .
According to the recent numbers done by the Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 is 10 percent less in comparison to 2008 .
According to the number 9 . 87 percent of the number of national tourists and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . percent less .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists came to Rajasthan in comparison to two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 thousand tourists .
Of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Koshik , director of Mexican in Rajputana Holidays , says that due to business depression and hazardous incidents the business of tourism has been very badly affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not develop and develop strong infrastructure in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India is less than 3 . 229 percent less than last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism this year has spent a lot of good .
After 2000 this time the number of tourists of Rajasthan decreased .
Nothing is happening from the point of view of tourism .
For the desert , palace , forts , lakes , forests everything has been kept in ancient state .
To work on the name of rural tourism , medical related tourism , adventurous tourism all governments have increased but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get less chances .
The incident of rape and disturbances happening with foreign tourists women in Rajasthan has also worsened the pictures of this state internationally .
The state government had given the status of tourism industry many years ago but it was limited to paper only .
One example of success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
This निगम gives the tourists accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . facilities .
There are total 75 units in this disease .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 models , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one acquaintance unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the situation of this park has worsened for some years .
The loss of 185 lakh rupees of RTDC occurred in 2008 - 09 which was estimated to be 632 lakhs in 2009 - 10 .
The hotel situation of this Nigam is such that in the last five years forty percent houses of this hotel are also not filled .
Along with the hotel other units of Nigam have also faced big losses from this .
Among these the main is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists have not been attracted towards this rail .
Even after reducing the fare it could not attract the tourists .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards the Pushkar fair has been seen less .
In 2007 - 08 this fair made from the point of view of RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stayed this year the number has decreased to 217 .
In the middle of all this the thrilling thing for RTDC is that palace on wheels i . . some deficit has been seen in the attraction of tourists towards the royal trains .
There is relief from this rail .
Last year the RTDC got nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
It is natural for the tourism in Rajasthan to be disturbed by this harm .
Tourism is the biggest source of Rajasthan economy .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can make gold from the earth .

As much as the height goes , the density of snow increases .

Insomnia in the whole body is also one .
The brightness of the weather in the rainy season is also one .
On getting the plan of Darjeeling journey the first decision is taken to take the brink of Karsiyang .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of dust filled with tea gardens is filled with forests .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
On moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri the tea gardens first welcome you in a joyous way .
It has been hypnotized to go for the first time through the way through tea gardens .
On one side green mountains filled with forests and on the other side deep green valleys .
Here sometimes forests and sometimes tea gardens can be seen .
Empire of greenery all around .
Once we had fallen in trouble - these natural forests will not see the trees of tea planted by humans .
Both were moving towards itself .
The more beautiful the jungle was the tea garden spread .
On looking at the road the creation appears strange .
Like the rice of snakes the tariffs and hilly roads were going on .
Time was also going on .
What was not cut is the jungle and tea garden .
Sometimes small foetus appears .
A lot of dense forests like mountain houses and houses were visible from far .
This was Karsiyang .
Staying in one place here we made a program of roaming all day .
So we left for a car to roam around Karsiyang .
First of all diar park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
The front was spread i . . to reach the diarrhoea park we had to leave the car very low .
Despite being rich with the beauty of Karsiyang even now it has not been developed or famous as a tourist spot .
Although the city is very clean .
Despite the absence of roads we were enjoying the pleasure of climbing the road between the luxurious and dusty trees to reach the deer park surrounded by the jungle .
The next place was Eagle Krang .
There is a point at a height on the other side of this city .
It is called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the time of British lovers used to commit suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected with a park and restaurant .
There is a caves here on which the whole of the city looks beautiful .
In tea gardens nearby women are capable of bringing tea leaves on the back with a tokri at a very fast speed .
There is an exhibition outside the city of Karsiyang , but on that day we could not go there because the journey of open weather in tea gardens seemed to be very important .
The next day Darjeeling was decided to roam .
This place was very thrilling but it was very much worried about how to roam around if such rains are occurring .
But connectivity was very good that on reaching the Rock Garden we could get the benefit of sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is more charming than this .
On going a little down from here you will find Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here the magnificence of flowing amidst stones is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we saw that the waterfalls in the rock empire are decorated here and the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are present in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw the air strip in Darjeeling after climbing up with cars .
From here all the hills and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telephone .
The weather enjoyment was still good .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , who knows from where the clouds came together and started shouting .
In the evening plans have been made to roam and buy in Malrode .
Toy train journey in Darjeeling makes it even more attractive .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to sleep and from Dharjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating and gardening in Miric lakes here are a bit comfortable .
On this way tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where the sowners made by Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is also a facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but the noise of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are - Lola and Lolehgaon , which are filled with forest waterfalls .
But due to lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling in the winter but tea gardens spread till Darjeeling from Shiligudi to Darjeeling tied me on my own .
My recent journey was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was not of foreign countries nor was it very close to outside Rajasthan , Jaipur .
Tourism is a thrilling thing in which sometimes the journey attracts us and sometimes the lake palace of Udaipur like a special place , water ship or a royal train or a pink city .
People get attracted due to some special attraction .
The place where I am going to say is made about four and a half years ago , but the preparation of this place is really worth making it magnificent in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
Even now in my ears we could not even think of my guide Ram Babu Mina ' before Sahiba that I could stay in my jungle like this .
Fifty percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people could not work even in heritage hotels .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajbagadh used to work in Jaipur before and now this royal garden is like this .
He has built a new structure in a different patch .
Sahiba is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
There nobody feels you in English .
Such a garden is really a peaceful and comfortable place .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is also introduced to the nearby areas .
The royal holidays of Rajasthan who have roamed in Bhangadh many of them , there is no need to go away , even among the residents of Jaipur maybe a little people have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of such a garden many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana invited me there but I could not go .
This thing is different that he had gone to Bhangarh by mistake on his own way .
This time I suddenly reached there to invite my foreign guest , it seems as if those who want to spend a better holiday for less time should go to such a place .
This garden is one of those seven tigers where the king of Alwar used to take rest to hunt .
It was constructed in nineteen or twenty .
Its ancient wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first sight of Aman Bagh will hypnotise you .
The way you enter , the way you will be welcomed , you will feel that attention is given to divine peace here .
The mantras of Mangalachari are considered to be a living excitement with the binding of mauli in the hands .
We reached in the evening and we decided to put a cyclone of the garden .
My majesty sister Jackie said very soon , This is very charming .
All the havelis and palaces are impressed .
The most beautiful is the light spot here .
Everything is new and artistic . There is no wonder that such a garden has been awarded in recent times .
Our program was fixed for the management morning .
First of all we roamed on foot with Ram Babu and then roamed in Bhangarh jeep .
While walking on the path of Kangra we saw the fort of Ajbagarh on which the light of the sun was spread slowly .
We saw the happy lakes in which the farmers are yielding .
This year there was no rain but first time I saw the production of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life was very pleasant for Jackie .
After this we went to Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
It's a million dollars.
While leaving such a garden they told us the farewell by eating our jaggery and curd in traditional dress .
Now we got to know why tourists come here spending so much .
I hear , tour packages are also prepared to see tribal lifestyle .
Is this right .
Surely this is done in many states and tourists show special excitement in this journey .
This tour is usually prepared for four days to two weeks and at this time tourists are taken to different places .
Among these staying there , eating etc are also included .
This way attempts are made to travel such places where there is not much development and there has not been a special effect on the lifestyle of nature and humans .
Along with this there are also ancient tourist sites .
Besides this attention is paid to the consumption of conscious food also .
Actually the purpose of this kind of tour is to face the tourism and tradition of the tourists in all these places .
Although it seems a little difficult to think but such a tour is really thrilling and a different kind of experience .
Touring by bus is a different joy .
Despite being with many in it you can enjoy staying alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can read your favorite books for a long time .
Yes , it is right that along with spending a lot of time in less expensive and peace this journey also claims to you all .
In order to enjoy this journey some things must be kept in mind especially when you are watching some foreign place by bus .
Find the best deal before taking tickets .
The elders of students , militaries , children etc . get rid of this journey , and there is arrangement of leave for both .
Although it is a little cheaper if you buy tickets beforehand therefore in the end it is better to do bus journey beforehand than plan .
Instead of taking tickets on both sides take information about round trips .
It is cheap .
Regulations related to goods are done specially therefore ask about the level and weight of the goods .
It does not happen that you have to leave your things in the terminal or pay advancing rate .
Also know the rules of breeding or harmfulness from the tour company .
Carry on bags take appropriate for this journey .
Because it gets stuck on the top of the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the bus during the tour your responsibility of the goods is responsible .
From where you will reach the bus you will reach there one hour before the scheduled time .
In the busy weather you should keep in mind this thing specially .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will find a better seating place .
Keep in mind comfortable while swimming in the place of sitting .
There is more narrowness in the back , and it is unable to fall properly towards the front .
If you go to the bathroom again and again then take a place towards the corner , if you do not like to be more distressed then it would be better if you take a seat towards the window .
Now it is a matter of cheating .
If you are both trying to knock then first put your bag in the nearby seat sitting in the corn seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while selecting the place of sitting because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Adopt with bus driver or conductor .
You will get to know many important information from this .
Everyone is called out while cleaning the bus .
During this time you will not leave your property place because if you lose it then the residents of the bus do not take care of it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back at the right time .
If you do not have time then you can take a new traveller in your place and you will have to wait for other buses in terminal .

While roaming around the big airplanes , if a sea plane stands in front of you suddenly you will feel to be playing it .
But with the place of 12 - 15 sits this island of Ooty Plain Maldives is unforgettable for roaming around .
It is not even known when the wind rises suddenly while running like a speed boat on the water .
In the entire flight you will feel as if you are climbing on a normal plane .
You will always be watching below - watching resort islands and islands in different kinds of blue colors of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are two syphilis components in Maldives .
Trans Maldives one of them has twenty-si planes .
If you want you can roam around around four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour or the entire C plane can hired for a journey throughout the day -LRB- for that there should be a taboo .
If you go to any other island from Malley Island then you will need a journey of C plane because that is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is a journey which you never want to finish .
The journey from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavilavaru -RRB- is done on Maldives Island .
We were at the biggest antique and golden shops of the capital in Ahmadine Bazar of Mal .
The president of all Salsman Maldives Mohammad Nashis had heard the details of the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
If we say so much then I have not seen any Hindu state listening to the President or Prime Minister so much .
But when there is a question of creation of a new existence on this earth then it is necessary to be so serious .
Many people will feel as if the nature ' s wrath is spreading from us , even after wearing the baked bags made under water by the cavity of Maldives in October .
There is a different kind of thing in its beauty .
In this small country it does not seem so beautiful .
While going to Jetty to return to the cruise again from that journey of the market when we realized that the people here know how much the price of this beauty .
Water is so clear that colorful fish is seen in the light of lampposters in a few metres deep .
This is the same part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you see some centimetres clearly in the sea or river water connected with any city of India then your luck is very good .
On coming to Amby Aquamirin the evening spent in the market has been remembered for two hours .
Koral Riff -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get crafts on Crambor .
Shortly before listening to President Nashis we were standing outside his official residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the houses of the highest personality of any country , no security personnel were visible till far .
We were enjoying the photographs of the garden just fifty metres away by increasing the hand inside the gates of its bangloon .
Can you think like this about any leader ' s house in India
It was also known that the president sometimes walked on foot and went to his office two blocks before crossing the road .
Every thing we feel about Maldives .
That is why we were waiting for the next day of Brussels .
It seemed as if this day would be special .
In the morning taking a boat from the cruise we were taken to the airport Island .
From there we reached the bus of Trans Maldives by cutting the Chakkar of Ranway .
The next day when we reached near the cruise mall , we immediately got to know the flights going above .
I saw many pictures .
But then did I know that next day we will get a chance to climb this plane .
We were going to Rangoli island five kilometres away from Trans Maldives on its sea plane .
The view of thousands of resorts and coral islands spread over the sea of Maldives on this sea plane waving at a height of approximately thousand metres is unforgettable .
This beauty of water is not seen anywhere else .
In adventure and excitement breathing was like a stopping flight .
But on reaching the Connaught Resort of the Hillton Hotel on Rangoli Island we felt as if we have come to another world .
In such a world which has no relation with the outside world .
There was no such relation that the beauty and beauty found here is difficult to get out .
Tour can also be done on foot or on a battery-free car .
From Jetty to the main island the view of water life on both the sides of the bridge was unique .
Even now we could not get up with the nature around , we reached such a place which was inappropriate .
On descending from the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a house of glass which was under water .
This house was actually a dining house .
On every side we could see small and big fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving people on the top of the glass .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated floor there is very thrilling .
On coming to this island from Male to Plain the rent of lunch of the underwater is 47 thousand rupees per person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to wear our passport water .
But I knew that this was not possible .
I returned with the hope that sometimes , sometimes , sometimes luck would definitely bring here .
For a long time I was planning to go out of Delhi but because of the busyness of work it was not possible .
Little time there was a lot of happiness of wild life so we thought that this time we would go to the Jim Corbett .
In 2006 this was the second bike journey after biking till Peng Lake before Khardungla pass in Ladakh .
On 27th December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but with the enthusiasm that we got out quietly reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajrola was very tiring .
On that again the path of curiosity and badness .
Many times it was felt that it would fall .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres before Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Tikuli near the park , which we had already kept booking .
On that day there was no special program , despite being cold we went to the coast of Kosi earlier .
After staying there for two - three hours we came out for Corbett museum which was near Gangdi Gate two kilometres away .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
We got back in the evening .
Being strong from Delhi I had come out that I would definitely see the tiger roaming in the jungle but I saw the tiger in the dream all night .
Suddenly at night I could hear loud noise and then the dogs which started crushing started walking for two hours .
Initially the advice of touring Kaladungi and Corbett fruits came .
Situated at a distance of thirty kilometres Kaladungi , Corbett falls on the way .
In Kaladungi there is a publication of Jim Corbett Sahib , where some special things related to his life are kept .
On returning we got twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village itself .
After reaching the resort the Safari Jeepsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they have arranged for sighting in the number one .
It is said about number one that there are more grass and lions here to escape from cold this time .
On reaching Vizrani we are given a guide that we will take two and a half rupees to roam around four hours .
We stayed for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw elephants of both the teeth , which had long teeth .
I photographed on the ground .
In the midst of this guide lions started trekking .
The guide told that there are about 150 tigers in the park , many of which have died in these days .
In many places we got to see the footprints of the lion , but the heart was upset because of not seeing the lion .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
The ghost of the lion was stuck on my head .
That is why I remember an old friend of Holdavani .
I called him the same way .
I told him that Corbett came.
He asked if I saw the tiger .
This thing of her was boring like a shore .
I said slowly that I did not see .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
One told us that for roaming inside take a ride .
