Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , others .
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is also two mixture in language .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
Although there is a language of speaking here , it has not written its own script .
If you want to write Kachhi then you will have to write in the script of Gujarati .
Near Bhubaneswar is that Anjar city where earthquakes came many times and the entire city got destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal - Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer - Toral is very charming .
The way we came from that way if we returned back then we had to take a monthly holiday again and the schools were opened there in Mumbai .
But what did we do now by telling to the fast buses of Gujarat we traveled in the rails .
Small trains going from Bhuj to Gej reach Rajkot .
From there another small train from your gauge reaches Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad a big rail from Broad gauge reaches Mumbai .
The tourism system considered to be the main source of the economy of Rajasthan is spending in a very poor state these days .
Due to the dangers of increasing intensity in Vaishno Devi and South Asia the tourism system has a lot of deficiency .
According to the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased very much during these days .
A new survey released from the state government has revealed that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the survey 9 . 87 percent reduction in the number of tourists of the country and 27 . 36 percent reduction in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 in Rajasthan a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 thousand foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participated in Rajasthan only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 thousand tourists .
Two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 people of the country and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are there .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , the founder of Rajputana Holiday Mekars said that due to the incident of Vaishno Devi and acumen the tourism system was completely affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not developed the tourism system here in strong , base .
Because of this the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to the last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan France is the most of the tourists .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has spent a lot of years .
After 2002 this was the first time that the number of tourists of Rajasthan was less .
There is no new happening from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , buildings , forts , ponds , forests all are the same ancient to enjoy the tourists .
In the tourism area the words of working with the name of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism all governments are said to be very important but in this direction nothing has been done .
The facility of tourists coming to Rajasthan is also very less available .
At the same time with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the incidents of humidity and humidity have also taken the beauty of this state internationally .
The Government of Rajasthan has already given the status of industry to tourism in Rajasthan a few years ago but it has become limited to papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation is an example of the state government victory in tourism .
With the aim of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them based on tourism the Rajasthan government established Artidity in 1979 AD .
This branch provides tourists the facility of residence , food , coming , boating etc .
There are 75 branches in this institute .
Among these 39 hotels , 22 models , eight cataract , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan wheels but the situation of this institute has remained behind for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh this year there is a chance of increasing 632 lakhs in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this institute is such that in the last five years there was no completion of forty percent rooms in these hotels .
Along with hotels other branches of the institute also have a lot of harm to it .
Among these the main are Royal Rajasthan of Way Hills .
Travellers on this train are not able to attract .
Even after decreasing fare it has not been able to attract the tourists .
This way in the present times during the Pushkar fair also the interest of tourists has been seen less .
In 2007 - 08 this fair was established by 398 foreign tourists in the tourist village built by RTDC , whereas this year the number is less than 217 people .
Among all this the interesting thing of RTDC is that only Palace on Wheels i . . there was no dearth of attracting tourists towards the city train .
This train is continuously beneficial .
Last year through this train RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees .
Due to this deficiency in the tourism sector of Rajasthan it has become natural to see the loss in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the most base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his mind then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy made a modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain peak of Maharashtra and showed it the truth .

The sight of the Himalayan mountain peak situated towards the left hand falls on the red color of the heaven rising above the rocks in the middle .
There is a lot of cold in the air .
Along with shivering cold one feels humidity in the environment .
A sound coming on foot looks at the tied layers .
The weather is quiet and because of being filthy before sunrise is not visible very well .
Eyes stay on red colored in the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench situated in Balkani .
On falling the hand the thin layers spread out slide with light sound and the hand gets separated immediately from cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this small village situated amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland is the first experience of spending night .
This is the third heritage of Swiss me .
Before this we spent a lot of time in Janiva or around it .
On both sides of the thin Balkhati river the maximum population of the valleys is spread till a height of light stones .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron Valley on both sides of which there are many small and big cities .
On the other side of the Rohn river the national highway and the vehicles moving on it are clearly visible .
The journey of 300 kms away and two and a half hours in the car is half the waterfall , along with the waterfall of Janiva and half the rose river the Geneva waterfall coming from the east along with the river Montro , which is called Lake Lama in French .
Geneva city is in the west of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide waterfall .
From there the waterfall again turns towards the western side of the river .
On the right side flowing like a waterfall , sky touching Alps mountain peaks are there .
On crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk we left this highway from the left side , coming to the mountainous path situated on the north .
Because of the mountainous plains being south facing the third day the sun gives sunshine to all the corners .
In comparison to valleys the condition of snow can not be considered less here .
As the snow goes towards the height , the thickness of snow is increasing .
While there is a lot of snow on both the sides of the road , due to the peaceful and lighting sun there is no coldness in the air .
By deciding about 20 k . . journey on this narrow hilly road half an hour we reached a small village named Thal .
There are palaces made up of rocks and rocks , walls of large storeys made of total wood .
In this building of three storeys along with standing cars in the foundation made of cement concrete there are parts of controlling necessary facilities like electricity , water , landry .

This is the main center of wine dryness .
In the entire calculated area 37 percent of the grape caterpillars are found .
In the villages around the Roin Valley grapes gardens give importance to its unique beauty .
To go on foot in the grapes , to roam them , to make them rest in the villages there and to show the taste of syndrome by taking them to the demonstrators industry is a part of the tourism department here .
There is a very big museum of grape juice in a garden made in 12th century in a small book named Age , to see which foreign tourists have to book English .
Once again we go through that desolate forest with Dawagani .
Till three - four k . . Darmata kids had become even more unconscious for the questions asking .
Suddenly due to a sight of a glimpse there is a dramatic and charming change .
Just straight , on the left side of the road a crowd of beautiful houses is established in the plains situated on a very deep valley .
People are skiing in snow in the plains adjacent to the village shore .
On the skiing slope a dense forest of gods is spread till the peak of Konda .
There is dense snow on all four sides .
The sun rays are shining at home in the village .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same peace is spread .
All around from mountain peaks to valleys the glittering ice empire is .
Within five minutes of coming we reached a big round wheel situated in the middle of that profession .

The name of this village is Albenin .
Albanian village is one of the ones found in Switzerland 's national heritage protection .
It is said in Darjeeling that only skiing taxis go to Sikkim so that checking does not take place .
The journey is going on , the place is another , but the mountain is the same , trees and plants , the sounding wind .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the blue light rising in the rainy season .
On the decision of Darjeeling journey plan it was decided to take Karsiyang kumbers first .
Karsang is a small city in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens is full of dust forests .
Good tea is famous for production .
On going towards Darjeeling from Siliguri the tea gardens in the beginning welcome the people coming towards themselves while smiling .
Going on the road from the middle of tea gardens first attracts the heart .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side deep slopes .
Once there were tea gardens in the jungle .
There was greenery empire all around .
Once I was starving , seeing this natural forest or seeing the tea gardens laid by humans .
Both were attracting towards itself .
How beautiful is the tea garden .
On walking on the roads the creation seems to be unique .
We were passing through the narrowness going to Papulla and passing the foot on the way .
Time is also going on .
Forests and tea gardens are not at all over .
Sometimes small potatoes were visible .
From a distance on a hill houses and buildings etc . were seen very rarely .
This is Karsang .
Stopping here at one place we made plans to roam around a day .
Therefore taking a car we left for the journey of Karsang .
First of all diar park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
Go up i . . to reach the deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
The beauty of Karsiyang is spread till now has not been developed as a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and very peaceful .
Although the road was clear , the joy of climbing the road between the desert and the dust trees to reach the Deer park filled with jungles was blessings for us .
The other place is the Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the British times lovers used to take life from here .
However , there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Siddhuma cave here on seeing from the height of which a beautiful view of the whole of the city is seen .
In tea gardens nearby women are engaged in breaking the leaves of tea while playing hands very fast on their backs .
There is a museum outside the city of Kasiang , but on that day we could not go there because it seemed very important to roam around the beautiful environment of tea garden .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling feeling in us , but it was very painful because of this how can we roam while raining .
But the weather is very good after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed while enjoying the sun coming .
This garden is a beautiful place worth seeing with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is more entertaining than this .
The Gangamaya flowing on some hills going somewhere down from here was visible .
Here the magnificence of waterfalls amidst stones is spectacular .
We saw in the Rock Garden that if the waterfalls in the empire of stones and stones are dissolved then the waterfalls in Gangamaya are decorated with stones in the world .
These two places are exhibited very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw smoke in Darjeeling by moving up with the help of vehicle .
All the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of telephone .
The quantity of weather has remained very clear till now .
When we went towards Monastery , the group of clouds did not know from where the clouds came and the clouds were flowing .
In the evening there is a plan to shopping on the Mall road .
The journey of Towy Train in Darjeeling makes a glimpse of thrilling silver .
The journey from Darjeeling to Guam and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction of the tourists .
Here in Mirik waterfall boating and a slight rest in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where in Nepali industry handmade sweaters etc . are found .
There is also a facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but the noise of forests and waterfalls .
The most famous tourist spot of Kalimpong is Lava and Lolegaon which are filled with forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We came to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling in the winter season , but the tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling here have tied their faces on their own .
My situation was a small journey very thrilling and thrilling .
This journey is not from foreign countries but from Jaipur is very close .
Tourism is a favorite thing in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes it can be a city like a major place , water ships or city rail or a city full of roses or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some major attraction they bring people towards themselves .
The place about which I am talking was made about four and a half years ago , but with the construction which this place came there he really cleaned the forest .
Not only the wishes of the people going there but also for the residents there .
In my ears our guide Raambaba 's words are replied , ' We did not even think that before that we could be like this in the jungle .
Fifty percent Sibbadi is the same place .
Suddenly I felt that such people did not get work in the heritage hotels as well .
Rambab , a resident of Ajabgarh , was working earlier in Jaipur and today in the Amman garden of this great Shahi beauty .
He himself harassed his words and discomforts a new way .
Aiya ' was estimated by Aman Bag .
There nobody will contact you with English language .
Aman Bag is actually a peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
That garden has its own history and the most important thing is that you will also know from the nearby areas .
In the palaces of Rajasthan how many of the people who spent holidays have roamed in Bhagwad of the earthquake , why should you go far , even in the people of Jaipur , Kuchek may have spent the night here .
After the construction of Aman Bagh big people from the country and abroad came there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi called me completely there but I could not go .
Another thing she left the way and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly my foreign brethren invited me to visit there then it seemed as if those people who want to spend their holidays in less time would definitely go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden of the remaining seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to make camps to hunt .
Its construction was done in fifteen hundred twenty .
Its ancient wall is witness to those days .
In the shadow of the mountains and the shadow of the sulphur trees the first glimpse of Aman Bag will hypnotise you .
As soon as you come inside you will welcome you , so you will feel that you pay attention to the great peace here .
Along with tying the head of Manikarn the aarti mantra is called as the life of mantra .
We reached there in the evening and we felt like putting in that garden around .
We were decorating our guest jokes , immediately gave me peace that it was very interesting .
All the buildings and forts are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Yes , on all the new ones , artistic , no wonder Amanbagh has got a gift even today .
Manejor decided our program in the morning .
First of all walking with Rambab and then jeep journey in Bhangarh .
While walking on the small road we saw the fort of Ajbagadh on which the sun rays are spread slowly .
We saw the dry lake in which rails are doing business .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the fruit of tobacco .
Jackie Kosam is a unique experience of rural life .
After that we reached Bhangarh through jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit of million dollars .
The same method as Aman Bag Alawinda is also traditional , by eating jaggery and curd we got ridiculous .
Then it was understood that why do tourists come here spending so much
I have heard that tour packages are also being put to show training life .
Is this true
There is no doubt that it happens in many states and tourists also show more interest in it .
This tour is usually decided for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying , eating etc .
This way an attempt is being made to explore such a place where there was not much development and there was no significant effect on time in the quantity of nature and people .
Along with this there are also ancient tourist sites here .
Besides this , it is also paid attention to serving trident kujin .
Actually , with the goal of such journeys tourists have to show hunting methods and traditions directly at that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such a tour is actually very interesting and a different experience .
Challu journey is enjoyable for us .
With this you can also enjoy roaming alone despite being with many people .
Not only this , on this journey you can give your favorite book free for a long time .
Yes , here it is so important that along with expense and a lot of time we reflect to keep an opportunity in this journey .
This is the reason that for enjoying these certain things must be kept in mind , especially whenever someone is watching with you through the destination tour of foreigners .
Find a good middleman before taking ticket .
Students , soldiers of army , children etc get stones in them , both of them also get a stone facility .
Although it is less than taking ticket before hence it is better to put a bus tour plan for the last minute before the planing cosmetic .
Instead of tower tickets know about the entire tour rate .
It is cheap .
There are some signs of material also , therefore you should also know about the quantity and weight of the material .
If this happens somewhere then you will have to pay some amount of money in terminals or more debt .
Along with this also know information about insurance or harmfulness in the tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take it .
Because they get fit in the rock on the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during the journey the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From wherever you go to the bus you can reach there , one hour before time .
During two times you should take special care of this matter .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you also have the chance of getting a good seat .
While choosing seat keep in mind your convenience also .
There are many scratches in the back seat , but it is not appropriate to read in the front seat .
If you have to go to urinate again and again then take the last seat and do not like much interval , the seat on the side of the window will be good for you .
Now it is a swift thing .
If you are in the seat to keep your hands on both sides then sit on the last seat beforehand and put your cheek on it .
If there are not many people in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is a facility of washing in the bus then keep in mind this thing as well as while choosing the seat because after some time it is difficult to sit there .
Introduce bus driver and manufacturer .
This way you will get information of many important things from them .
Everybody is told to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your stuff on the seat because they go so that the buses do not take responsibility for it .
If the bus stops anywhere then come back to time .
If you do not come on time , your place can be available to any new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

After this if you stay in the fair then even then you can get hotels at a little less price but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the true beauty of Maldives then money will be reduced in the pocket .
Circuits prove to be very useful here .
In the week before December itself Lukerose Maldives and Colombo started the only cruise of India from Kochi .
Luycruz has achieved a lot of popularity in the business of European companies and cruise hotels .
Although due to some problems Lui cruise has now reduced its services but it is believed that it starts again from October .
You can go to Maldives for cruise for three days every night about 5850 rupees per person in Lui cruise ship Emvi Equorine .
That is , the fare of one person less than 18 thousand rupees for three days .
But if there are two elders then the children of 15 years are completely free .
Besides this .
In the fare of cruise tea-tiffin , food everything is available .
Every minute is with dysentery .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the calculations , activities available in Maldives according to the numbers in your pocket - from sea plane ride to the underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a syphilin has stopped coming before you so you feel like sports .
But this 12 -15 stairs -LRB- 12 - 15 stairs -RRB- is the best way to roam around Ooty Plain Maldives like Archipelago .
It is not known when it flies in the air while running like a speed boat on the water .
On flying completely you will not feel as if you are flying ordinary flights .
Every moment your eyes will be seen below the window , in the variety of blue colored water of the Maldives the resort islands and the coral islands are covered with smoke .
Everything looks so good .
There are two syphilin companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives one of them has twenty seplines nearby .
If you want then you can roam around around four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour airplane or you can take a fare for spending all day in the entire sea plane .
Although if you go from the island to another island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the way to travel through different islands .
And that is such a journey that you will never feel the feeling of finishing it .
The journey from 12 k . . to 183 k . . is done in Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and golden shops of the capital of Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
A day before by Mr . Mahmoud Nashid the President of Salsmanta Maldives the conference given in the World Environment Convention in Copenhagen is being heard very carefully .
Actually I have to say that I have not seen any Indian listening to the conference of state governments or prime ministers so carefully .
But when there is a question of the statistics of a new creation on this earth then it is unparalleled for such seriousness .
Many people consider it unsuccessful in the context of water coming in the Maldives by cobbet in October but if the Maldives go on then it seems that if natural opponents lock from us then the world gets down in such a situation .
There are many such importances in the beauty there .
In that small country as if the beauty is mixed .
While returning to the jetty to go back to their cruise from that market when our eyes go towards the water of the sea while moving towards the road then it feels as if the people here can understand the value of these beauty as far as possible .
Water is so clean that the fish swimming in many metres deep below in the light of the lappost looks like all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely different from the city .
If you can see the water of any other sea or river completely from any city of India then you will be very lucky .
While returning to Emvi Ekamerine we were roaming in the jungle for two hours in the evening spent in Malay .
Koral Riff is the life here .
As far as possible you will also get to see rocks of past in the stones on the tombs .
Just a few moments before listening to President Nasheed 's conference we were standing outside his government residence center .
It is not believed that we were ahead of the highest testimony building of the other country for some time there is no protector .
We were taking photographs of Vasaara and gardens situated about fifty kilometres away from the gate of their building .
Can you think of any royal family in India
Here also it was known that at times the president goes to his office before two blankets crossing the road on foot .
Everything is surprised about the Maldives .
That is why I am very tired for the next day .
Devvani means that on that day some major incident was going on .
In the morning a ship from Cruise brought us to the airport Island .
From there we reached Maldives pass by roaming around in the runway .
First evening when the cruise was approaching Malay then we immediately remembered the syphilin going up .
How many photographs have been seen .
But then it was not lost that next day there was a chance of traveling in it .
We had to go to Rangali island of five and five kilometres through the seaplane of Trace Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see thousands of trees spread in the sea of Maldives from Sepline flying up to a height of approximately a thousand kms .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere .
It is a courage to fly up without taking breath with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Konarad resort of hill stations in Rangali Island it seemed as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , there is no relation with any country outside it .
Waste is also not such that it is difficult to get out of such beauty or light .
Walking on Konark can also be done on foot or by cars running with battery .
On both the sides of the bridge going from Jatti to the main island its lifestyle of tribes is unique .
Now we are not able to believe us naturally in the nature nearby , we reached such a place which is unforgettable .
With the help of stairs going into the sea water several metres down we reached the room with glass which was inside the water .
That room is usually a dining room .
We can see all kinds of small and big fishes , corals , snow crawling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating sitting on the carpets decorated there was very thrilling among us .
On coming to this island from Malay to Syphilis the fare of seeing and roaming the underwater is 47 thousand rupees for a person .
He did not feel like returning from there .
We were also ready to break our passports in the water .
But know , this is not so easy .
With this unwanted belief , then whenever there is any chance , then fortunately brings it here .
For many days we were planning to get out of Delhi but the work was not possible to go anywhere due to pressure .
Since childhood the life of wild life was liked but I thought that why did this synonym go to Jim Corbett
In 2006 after baiting from Khardugla in Ladakh to Pegog lake situated ahead this is the second biker .
In the month of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but whatever excitement we left , the speed of the smoke was visible .
The journey between Hafoot and Gajrola is really ruined .
Smoke on top and roads in front .
Many times we felt as if we had become more .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resorts were in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
That day there was a major program that we went to visit Kosi shore while winters .
After spending two - three hours there we went out to the Corbett museum , at a distance of 2 k . . is near the Dhangadi gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was evening for returning .
After deciding from Delhi we definitely saw the lion roaming around in the jungle that I was watching the lion all night .
In the middle of deep sleep at night suddenly I heard a lot of noise and after that the dog 's race started and did not last for two hours .
It was decided to roam Kaladungi and carboot falls before the incident .
Kaladungi is thirty k . . away , then came on the carboot fall path .
Kaladangi gym carboot adventure museum , where they have kept some important things related to life .
The return was fifteen .
Kaladangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
The journey to reach the resort is waiting for us .
It has been told that they have provided a cycling facility in a suitable budget there .
When we asked about number one then it is said that there is a lot of grassland and Tiger comes to that place to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijarani we gave a guide , they take two hundred fifty to roam around for four hours .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw many kinds of animals and deer of various species there .
Inside we saw two toscar elephants , which had big teeth .
I took photographs patiently .
In the midst of this guide Tiger started trekking .
Guide has said that in the park around 150 tigers , some of them have died today .
At some places we also saw their punja memories , but because of not seeing the tigers I was unconscious .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
The land of Tiger was in my mind .
That is why I remember one of my older sons of Haldani .
I photographed him for Saradake .
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
He asked whether he saw the tiger or not .
His words are like a boy to me .
I said gradually , no .
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Who gave us advice that you should take a ride inside .
