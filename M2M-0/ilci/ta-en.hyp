The tourism industry which is considered to be the main source of the economy of Rajasthan has become worse nowadays .
There is a bad effect on the tourism industry going along with increasing dangers in Vaishno Devi and South Asia .

The situation of hotels of this organization is this that 40 percent of its hotels are not even filled in the last five years .
The other part of the hotel organizations are getting damaged .
The most important among these is Royal Rajasthan and Vegetables .
This train does not like any tourist .
Despite less fare it has not been able to attract tourists .
In this way every year tourists started decreasing interest .
398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist organization of RTDC in the year 2007 - 2008 , in which this year its number was 217 .
Among all these there is no doubt that the pleasure of RTDC , Pells on Weikikikals i . . the tourists roaming around in the beautiful train .

This was Karsiyanga .
Staying at a place here we make a program to roam around the entire day .
That is , taking a car you can go out of Karsang .
First of all diar park .
A small garden is surrounded by forests all around .
The train is very low to reach from above .
Though Karsiyang is full of beauty , now there is no progress in the tourist spot .
Although the city is very good and clean .
The passing through the trees of dense forests and the passing through the path between the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees gives us a pleasant feeling .
The next place was Ishalkar .

In the tea garden nearby women turned their backs and jumped tea by shaking their hands at the very fast .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsang but that day we should not go out because it is very important to go to tourism according to the environment of tea gardens .

Sometimes the effect occurring was not seen in the Kalimpong this way .
We arrived in the winters , Darjeeling , that is where tea plants spread from Chiligudi to Darjeeling have built us .
I had more interest and thrill in this small journey .
This journey is not only in foreign countries but also in Jaipur outside Rajasthan .
Tourists enjoy a thing in itself in which when tourism roams towards itself then continuously there is a major place , water ship , or a city like a train or a rose city or a lake of Udaipur .
People are attracting because of some special attraction .
I am saying that the place was built about four and a half years ago , in fact along with this organization these places make the decoration of wildlife .
Not only to go there but also to stay there .
In my ears the word of my handicraft Raambabu Meena reflects that if we were not able to think before it then we would stay in the jungle .
50 percent workers are in this area .
The permanent people coming here suddenly did not even work at the heritage hotel .
Ajpgarh resident Rambabu had worked in Jaipur before this and now this unique estimation is in the Amman Garden .
He gave a new shape while talking to himself .
Chakipa is the glorious garden of the Ammon garden .
There nobody calls you in English .
Aman Garden is actually a peaceful place and tourist spot with all the best facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it introduces its nearby areas .
For spending holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people roam around the gardens of flowers , why should they go far away , some people of Jaipur can usually spend the night in this area .
After the opening of the Aman Garden many people of the country and abroad come there .
I remember that night when Sapna Asma called me very interesting but I could not go .
If they came to Bangad after finding out the way , then it would be different .
This time when I suddenly felt as if these people want to spend a better holiday at least because of the invitation of my foreign residents then they must go to Ammon Garden .
This garden is a separate garden protected in those seven gardens where Alwar king had gone for hunting .
Its construction was done in 19 - 20th century .
Its ancient wall is witness to those days .
In the shadow of mountains and dense trees Aman Garden attracts you in the first part .
Just as you come inside you will welcome yourself in the same way , therefore it is said that you can enjoy the most peaceful environment here .
The Mangalore Mantra is very fast with the construction of the stairs in the hour .
We reached Dule in the evening and there was a roaming excitement of that garden .
My companion Jackie was decorating a jewellery and immediately spoke , so it was interesting .
All the palaces and palaces were attracted by the litigation .
Everything is beautiful .
There is no surprise in getting awards to the Ammon Garden because all are modern artistic .
Manager gave our program for the morning .
First of all we walked with Babu and then we traveled to Bangad in Jeep .
On going to the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbahad , in which the sun light was spread slowly .
On seeing the dry lake the farmer was cropping in it .
Because of not raining this year we saw the smoke field for the first time .
The rural life of Jok was such a unique experience .
After that we went to Bang Ad through jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist spot sitting very carefully .
This is an unprecedented moment of  .
From Aman garden also Alvita had traditionally told us that by giving jaggery and curd we were invited .
Tourists can now know why they come here spending so much .
I am told that a tourist group has been formed to show the life of tribals .
Is this correct
Certainly this is found in many states and tourism shows its main interest in it .
This tourism is ordinarily organised for 4 days to 2 weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this how to stay there .
Such an explanation is done where there is no excessive development and there is no special precaution in the lifestyle of the nature and people .
Along with this there are also ancient tourist species there .
Besides this attention is also given to the survey of trident cuisines .
In reality for such tourists the lifestyle and strife of that place can be seen directly .
Though it is a little difficult to think , but going to such a tourism is interesting and gives a different experience .
Tourists enjoy going through buses .
Even if you see a crowd of people here you can enjoy roaming differently .
Not only this , in this journey you can take too long to read your favorite book .
Yes , with less expensive and calmness all the time this journey definitely keeps us happy .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things when you are watching some foreign station bus tourism .
Find in the past team before taking the ticket .
For students , militari people , children etc . tickets are available here for two people .
In such a situation it is better to buy a journey ahead therefore it is better to arrange tourism in the buses in the last trains if you have to arrange arrangements beforehand .
Instead of traveling they can tell details about the round trip .
The cost of the morning is also less .
It is very important to take things therefore listen to the matter of obesity and weight .
You leave some of your things with turmeric or you can fill the electromagnetics .
At the same time get the enjoyment of insurance or loss from the tourism board .
Get the garrison box safe .
Because it can be put in the rock on the top of the seat .
This thing should be kept in mind that during the time of tourism the responsibility of changing things from bus itself .
Wherever you have a bus go one hour before that time .
During the time of bicycle you should keep this thing in the main time .
Actually as soon as you go , the best seat organization is near you .
While selecting the house keep in mind the facilities .
Take too much of the below but it is not possible to read in the front shoes .
If you have to urinate again and again then take a bed away , if you do not want to make much trouble then it is better for you to sit near the door .
Now there is a strange thing .
If you sit in a sitting seat then first sit in a seat on the face and keep your pack on the other side .
Therefore if there is no crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore if there is a facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing as well because it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get enough information .
Everyone is told to come out while cleaning the market .
During this time do not put yourself on the chit because if it goes away then the residents do not take charge of it .
Wherever the bus stands , return back to time .
If you do not go on time then you can see a new tour in your place and you will have to wait for another bus .

The museum here is also important because if you leave it then you will lose the opportunity to see beautiful architecture .
The statues built here are second century and are so decorated .

If you want you can roam around around 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour or complete blanket for you is left to travel throughout the day .
If you go from Maldives to a clean island then it is necessary to travel in Christian Blair because it is normal to travel between different islands .
And this is a journey , so that if there is fear in mind that there is danger then do not travel in it .
C . Blair travels from 12 k . . to 183 k . . on Maldives Island .
We were in the most entertaining and sweet markets of the capital of Ahmadine Bazar situated in Maldives .
All the salesmen are listening to the words given in the world centuries in the colonies a day before by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasik .
I am confident that a Hindu also does not listen to the words of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a challenge in this earth 's architecture then such a fear is unforgettable .
Some people go inside the water through the Capeine of Maldives in October , know the mantra of Maldives properly because the world becomes so impossible when they snatch the wrath of nature from us .
In the beauty there are many such specialities .
There is no such beautiful harmony in that small country .
On roaming around the market they return to Jetty to go to their guruj then definitely take a diet of sea water while paying attention to the road because the people here know this beautiful surprising border .
Fish swimming in a few metres deep under the light of Lamp Pongt showed all its colors .
It was a sea portion which was connected to the city .
If you can see some centimetres in the river or sea water connected to any city of India then you will enjoy yourself .
On returning to M . . Aquarium in Maldives roams in the jewels for two hours in the evening .
Goralrip -LRB- pavilion -RRB- is the life here .
Till now you will find stones and pavilions of the stones mentioned on the pavilions of the pavilion .
To ask President Nasik ' s words we were standing outside in some government clubs .
We were ahead of the headquarters of the best position of a country , there was no security for a long time because we could not believe .
Enjoying we were taking photographs on the garden and rock way about 50 metres away with the hand of his deep mouth .
Can you think like this by bringing some ordinary head home in India
It is said that the president had always come to his office two plates before crossing the roads on foot .
Every thing about Maldives is very interesting .
That is why I was expecting the next day unconsciousness .
That day was important as a good humor .
In the morning a boat from Guruji had entered us up to the Eor Fort Jalande .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives after roaming around in the runway .
Later in the evening when Guruji was coming out of Maldives then we immediately recognized C . Blain coming out .
We were watching his maps .
But then there was no doubt because the next day there was a chance to pay attention to it .
We had to go to Rangali Island a 500 km away from the Cig Blain of Trans Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see hundreds of Risanth and Goral islands spread in the sea of Maldives floating till about 1000 metres .
This beautiful water is not available anywhere .
This is the journey to stop breathing with thrilling and enthusiasm .
But on going to the Hillton Hollsin Gonord resort on Rangai Island it feels as if we have come to another world .
In such a world , there was no contact with any other world outside .
It was difficult to get out of the beauty or species of life there .
One can go to Konark by walking or by train running in Peteria .
While going from Jetty to the main island , on both the sides of the bridge lifestyle was strange .
Now we came to the unimaginable imagination that we could not be natural with the nearby nature .
On getting down several metres below the stairs we went inside a glassroom which was inside the water .
That half was actually a dining room .
Through glasses all around we could see marvellous types of small - big fishes , colors , snow rings and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables keeps on surprising in itself .
The fare of this island from Malay to sea plane is 47 thousand rupees for a ruler to see and drink food under water .
There is no mind coming back from there .
We were prepared to swim our passport in water .
We know it's not going to happen.
We returned with the same faith in the mind , then sometimes in a turn we must be surprised .
There is a plan to go out of Delhi for a long time but because of being engaged in work it does not work .
Because of the desire of wild animals from the child we thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 after picnicing up to Yekong lake at some distance from the near of Kartugula in Ladakh this was another pocket .
In the morning of 27th December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the bustle that came out with us decreased our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Kazrola was really tired .
From May to snow and thick road ahead .
Many times it appeared that when we are getting scattered .
One way we reached Karzrola at eight o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock properly .
Corbett National Park is at a distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
We had a ticket near our resort park , which we had already registered .
Because of no special event at night we went to tour the coast of Kosi first after getting cold .
We went out to the Corbett museum after two - three hours , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below the day .
It took a long time to return to the evening .
We got out of Delhi that on seeing the tiger coming out of the jungle , I would see the tiger in awe all night .
In the middle of the dark night suddenly I heard a loud voice , after that the dogs did not stand for two hours .
Therefore first comes on the way to Kaladungi and Karbett falls .
In Kaldungi there was a museum of Jim Corbett Aiya where some information related to personal life was kept .
The museum of Jim Carbett Aiya in Kaldungi .
It was just half an hour after returning .
Kaldungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village itself .
On reaching the hotel Safari Jeepsy was waiting for our arrival .
He told us that he had arranged to roam around there in one side of the road .
While asking about one more number , the tigers come towards that side to save the cold winters .
On reaching Bijarauli we got a guide , buying hundred fifty rupees for roaming around for four hours .
We went out to go inside the forest .
There are many species of birds and monkeys here .
Inside we saw two storied elephants , which had long teeth .
I picked up the film after standing .
In the midst of this the guide started dragging Billi .
There are approximately 150 tigers in the park in which some tigers have died in the same year .
In many places we saw their footprints , but because of not seeing the tiger I was upset .
On the third day we had to go back to Delhi .
In my brain there was a decrease in seeing the tiger .
Then I remember one of my old friends of Haldwani .
I contacted him on the phone.
I told her that I'm coming to the carpet.
Whether the LTTE was seen or not .
His words were like a pearl .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take a bik for the park .
One told me to take a ride to go inside .
