His language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in languages .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
Although this is ' bid ' it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kachhi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj only is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the entire city has been destroyed .
The samadhi of Jaisal - Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we come from that path only then we will have to take more than a month 's holiday and on this side the schools will open in Mumbai .
Then what should you do  I will now travel in the railway by waiting for fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of metro gauge from the arm will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of metro gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
Tourist industry counted as the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and increasing risks in South Asia the tourism business has got a big blow .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been recorded very less these days .
The latest figures published by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the figures the number of national tourists has decreased by 9 . percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent .
In Rajasthan in 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countries and 10 lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Holiday Mekers of Rajput , says that global recession and terrorist incidents have completely affected the business of tourism .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not even develop strong baseless structures of tourism there .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to the previous year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the fresh years have been better for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , fountains , fountains are all old .
In the area of tourism the government does the talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of blasphemy and irritation have also made this prince ' s appearance internationally .
Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state years ago but it has remained consolidated only till the papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
Rajasthan government had constructed RTDC in 1987 with the aim of exciting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic structures of tourism .
This corporation provides facilities of residence , food , driving , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 acres of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 big , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one vehicle accommodation and two train palaces on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has also worsened for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in the year 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels have not been completed .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also making them a big mistake .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attraction towards this railway .
Even after reducing the fare they could not attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a deficiency of tourists towards Pushkar fair .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists had stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC , this year this number has decreased to 217 .
Among all this is a satisfactory thing for RTDC that there is no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal trains .
This railway is continuously providing benefits .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
Due to this mistake in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the area of tourism .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by establishing the modern city Amboveli in the Sahayadri range of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dream they had seen , they glitter happiness in their eyes on seeing it progressing day by day .
His happiness was also seen at the time of the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a better city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres only 9 percent of the land hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available .
On 91 percent land trees , lakes , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Several industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city made for only crores of women and today there are about 800 families in this city .
Initially industrialists and Americans bought their residence here in the form of Holiday Home and now they have made it their first house and they travel to Mumbai for work from here .

At this place a decorated statue of Devi Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this statue and place many sweet stories and ancient stories are popular among the residents here .

The time of Chetia kings was considered to be far and wide in the north eastern hills of this Devi .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifice of humans was also offered here which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
It is called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is situated in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the legends popular here this place is Vidarbha itself , where at one time the king used to rule Bhishamak .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Digaru , Mishmi etc . tribes here give guidance to the travellers .
These people themselves also have a lot of faith towards this pond .
The famous Parashuram Kund is near the Brahma Kund itself .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The remains of brick pond near Roing are still telling their story even today .

At a height of 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of the visitors .
This is the same charming place where the guests live .
It took several days to reach here before making the way to the jeep .

Here rice farming is very much .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this layer is a living example of their labour and ability to harvest .
The necessity of its irrigation is fulfilled from the black river .
The trees of Pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
Eyes fall on the redness standing in the sky on the middle of the snow laden mountain range of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
Along with coolness in the environment there is also feeling of moisture .
The snakes of snow spread on the surface of the wood are seen from the sound of garbage below the feet .
There is silence in the environment and because of the smoothness before sunrise there was no more visible .
Eyes become stable in the redness of the east .
One feels a feeling of sitting on the ladder lying in the lap .
On applying the hands the sticky skin of the skin gets stuck with the sound of the common bitterness and the hands get separated from the shock with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night coming in this small village amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third trip in Swiss .
Before that we spent a lot of time living or around it .
On both the sides of the small flowing river and dense population settled in the valley is spread much above normal slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The coarse highway of the Ron river and the cars running on it are clearly visible .
The journey of 300 kms from the car and half an hour from the car along with the parallel to the Jinnah lake and half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction along with the Ginnava lake named Montro which is said to be in Lock Lake .
Geneva city is situated on the western part of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there the lake again moves towards the western side after becoming a river .
On the left side is Dhaval , Gaganchubi Alps mountain ranges .
On crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk we leave this highway from the left side on the hilly road towards the north .
Due to the slope of the mountain being south facing the sun in the afternoon is giving full heat to all the corners .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here .
As we move towards the height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite being accumulated good snow on both the sides of the road due to clear sky and shining sun there is no special coldness in the air .
After completing a journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thale .
Chalet slope is covered with roofs , completely large multi-storeyed bungalows made of wood .
There are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , dhobighat along with the parking of cars in the bulls made of cement concrete of three storied bungalows .
Walai is famous for grape farming in Switzerland .
This is the main center of the preparation of alcohol of grapes .
37  of the entire cantonment is made of grapes on the ground .
In the villages situated on both the sides of the Rohn Valley grapes provide a unique area to its beauty .
To move there to the grapes , to rest in the villages there and to chew alcohol while taking it into the factory of liquor is a different part of the tourism business here .
In a small village named Aga there is a very big museum of grapes in a fort built in 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to register ahead .
Once again we come out from the middle of that jungle which has been bursting from Damanal .
Three - four kilometres away from the challenges happening to children on the entire road heart gets very happy .
On one side a dance and charming change comes from the scene .
Just in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is formed .
People are skiing in snow on the flat slope from above the village .
From the skiing slope till the peak of the mountain dense forest of deodar is located .
Crossed snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the population are shining due to the falling of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also peace is covered .
From the peak of the mountains to the valleys all around the empire of white snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big circle in the middle of that village .
The name of Kasba is Lucarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lukarabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists coming here can be estimated from this point that 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 1500 shells are 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants .

In the blooming heat the large layer of snow is shining above the roof of houses .
The name of Albanin is this village .
Albenin village is one of the places of ' conservation achieved in the form of a heritage of national importance ' in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can go only taxis of Sikkim therefore there is no test .
The journey is going on , the region is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are the same swimming winds .
The moisture on the whole body is the same .
This is the blue colored shadow in the environment of monsoon .
On the completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey first it was decided to see Karsiyang .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dust jungles .
Famous for the production of excellent tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then initially the tea gardens welcome the coming towards us by smiling .
The first time passing through the road in the middle of tea gardens hypnotise the heart .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side deep green valleys .
On this side sometimes forests and sometimes tea gardens are visible .
There was a empire of greenery all around .
Once I fell uncomfortable , see these natural forests that the trees of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful jungles , the more beautiful the tea gardens spread far and wide .
On seeing the roads of the roads the scene looks marvellous .
The circular and circular path of snake walking was passing .
Time was also going on .
If we did not pass , then forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small towns can be seen .
From a distance itself a mountain started looking very dense from houses and houses etc .
This was Kerseyang .
Staying at one place here we made a program to roam all day .
Therefore taking a car we got out on the journey of Kerseyang .
First of all diar park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
To reach the climbing from the top i . . deer park the car has to be left very low .
Despite being enchanted with the beauty of Kerseyang , it could not be developed - famous as a tourist spot .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
Despite the deprivation of the road the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by the forests and the joy of climbing the road between the dust trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called sunside point .
It is said that in the times of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
Now , this is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a stairsed dome here , by observing the entire city from the height of which beautiful scenes appear .
In the tea gardens nearby women were tired of breaking tea leaves running hands with a very slow speed on the back .
There is a museum outside the city of Kerseyang on that day we could not go there because it seemed very important to tour the hot environment of this garden .
The next day Darjeeling was decided to roam .
It was a thrilling experience among themselves , but there was a great concern with it that if there was rains like that then how would we return .
But the combination was very good that on reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place flowing with broad rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
Going a little more below from here we found the Ganga Maa surrounded by mountains .
Between the broad rocks from here the mirror of the waterfall is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we saw that in the empire of stones and broad rocks waterfalls are splendid then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is divided by stones .
Both these places are located very below the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling climbing up with the help of the car .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of binoculars .
The mood of the weather was still clean .
But where we moved towards Monastery , decreasing where we came and started shouting .
There was an arrangement of roaming and shopping at Malrod in the evening .
Toy train increases the pleasure of journey in Darjeeling .
The journey of Toy Train from Darjeeling to Dhum and Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
Here in Mirik lake boating and a little rest in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route where hand made sweaters of Nepalese artists etc . are found .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is such a city of Darjeeling district but its form - color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but the arrival of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Laha and Lolegaon which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shadow of cold but here the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling stopped me .
A small journey of my latest was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan but very close to Jaipur .
Travelling is a interesting thing in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , then sometimes there is a special place , a ship of water or some royal train or a pink city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come straining .
The place I am going to talk is ready just about four and a half years ago , but the place which is situated there with the preparation has actually made a magnet in the jungle .
Not only for the people going there but also for the people staying there .
In my ear my guide Ram Babu kisses the words of Mina , Sahiba did not even think before that that we could stay in the jungle like this .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajbgarh resident Rambabu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Amnag .
They had put their words in a new color .
Sahiba ' is the estimate of aman garden .
There nobody calls you with English relations .
Aman Bagh is really a comfortable journey of peace and all pleasures .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you to the surrounding area .
Some of the people who spend holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan must have visited Bhutongarh , why to go far , some of the people of Jaipur may have spent the night in that area .
After opening Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have gone there .
I remember that night as well when Shaba 's Azmi had called me there from Taluka but I could not go .
This thing is different that he had reached Bhangarh after forgetting the way .
This time on the invitation of my foreign guest suddenly when I reached there then I felt that those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they must go to our garden .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to hunt .
Its construction was done in nineteen and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of the Aman Bagh in the shadow of mountains and dense trees attracts you .
Just as you come in the way you are welcomed , it seems that attention has been given to the divine peace here .
Along with binding a mauli in Kanda the mantra of Manglachar is made alive .
We reached in the evening and thought of mortality in front of that garden .
My guests who have been decorating a decorator , suddenly said , ' This is interesting ' .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . There was no surprise that Amn Bagh has also been found to be an architect in recent times .
The manager fixed our program for the morning .
First journey with Ram Babu on foot and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw a dry lake in which the peasants were making farming .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
For which such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an unmatched moment of million dollars .
The way to call Amn Bagh a new way was traditional , by eating jaggery and curd they promised us .
Now it was understood that why do tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show residential life .
Is this the best .
Of course this happens not only in many states and migratory also shows a lot of juice in it .
This journey is usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Eating etc . are also included in it .
This way attempts are made to explore such places where there was not much development and where the lifestyle of nature and people did not have any effect on time .
Along with this where places worth seeing for ancient tourists etc are also present .
Besides this , traditional cuisines are also paid attention .
Actually the purpose of such a journey is to make the tourists experience the lifestyle and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such a tour is actually interesting and makes a different kind of experience .
Just the joy of touring is its own .
With this despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time without playing your favorite book .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving a lot of time with less expensive and peace travels keep your demand for patience .
This is the reason that to accept it some things have to be kept in mind , especially then , some foreign places are going with the help of bus trip .
Check the best package before taking tickets .
Students , learners of luxury , people , children etc get rid of it , then there is also a facility of freeing for two persons .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets beforehand , therefore instead of fixing bus trip in the last moments it is better to do the plan a little earlier .
Get information about the journey of the cyclone without the ticket of both the sides .
It is cheap .
Regulations for goods are specially stiff , so ask about the stuff and weight of the goods .
It does not happen anywhere that you will have to leave your stuff at the station or you will have to pay more fees .
Also know the rules of compensation of Vimo or loss from the travel company .
The bags of keeping together are right , walk with .
Because on this seat the horse comes properly .
Also keep in mind that while changing the time of tour you will have the responsibility of the goods .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the coming season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have the best seat choice .
While fixing the seat keep in mind the concentration .
If there is a lot of shock on the last seat , then reading on the next seat is not right .
If you have to go to urine again and again , then take a corny seat and if you do not like to face much trouble then window seat will be appropriate for you .
Now the thing of a walker .
If you are in a two-seat fish then sit on a corny seat first and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then the organization will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in bus then keep in mind this thing as well as while fixing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identity with just driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this do not keep your luggage on the seat because they do not take the responsibility of getting lost .
Wherever you stay , return back .
If you do not come in time then you can find some new patrons and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .
It is said that if we did not see Rome in Europe then we did not see anything .
The capital of Italy is Rome , ancient European city and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of those ancient cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .
This is the reason that its mark is seen on official living .
Situated on Taibar river Roman is a pilgrimage for the followers of the Catholic religion because the main ' Pope ' of this religion is in Rome itself .
Old Rome was situated on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , cervical wall was built around it .
Its remains can be seen around Rome even today .
Rome is famous worldwide for ancient buildings and their remains .
This city with grand palace , magnificent churches , beautiful fountains , domes and museums keeps you magically attractive in the first glance .
This large and unique building of white marble dedicated to the ruler of Italy , Victor Immenuel II began to be built in 1885 and its work was completed in 1911 .
In front of it a statue is built on the horse of Emperor Emanuel which took 20 years to be built .
Here unknown soldiers who were martyred in the first world war were buried .
The carvings of this memorial and victory marks built on it are worth seeing .
There is also a museum here .
If you have juice in art galleries then you must see it .
Together with the memorial is not only of Rome but also the famous and grand chowk of Italy ' Peja Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this Chowk is famous as Vijay Chowk of Delhi .
Besides this ' Piyatsa de Spagna ' is also very popular among the tourists and where people come to meet each other in the evening .
After enjoying Peja Venezia you must also go to Rome 's famous road i . . ' Via Del course ' .
Big shops , churches and palaces built here increase the grandeur of this road .
Keep in mind that this road is the main road of Rome .
This second building is built on ' Capeline Hill ' and is located at a height .
The famous sculptor Michael Angelo built the stairs to climb it in 1536 .
In front of the Capital Line on a horse on the morning is the statue of Emperor Marcus Orelius ' , who ruled Rome till 160 - 180 .
This grand idol will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the Capeline is also a different identity of this building .
A church , museum and ancient temple are also built in ' Capital Line Complex ' .
The symbol of Rome is colossium .
The construction of this huge ruins was done in 80 AD and here 50 thousand viewers could sit together .
In colossal gladiators i . . swords used to show their art .
They used to face not only in themselves but also wild animals .
The heartbeats these fights , whether with other swords or animals , continued till one of the fighters died .
There were many ' Forum ' in the ancient Rome .
Tell us that light spots are called phoram in Rome .
All social , religious , economic , political etc . activities of the city used to happen here .
Among these the most famous forum was Romanum and the remains of Raj Bhavan , temples and pillars are present at this place even today .
Of course after seeing this the grandeur of ancient Rome becomes very good .
Paithiyan : This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
There is an open place of 30 feet amidst its large dome .
Because of this place devotees feel so happy that their prayers are reaching the gods directly .
Statues of gods and goddesses are built all around inside the temple .
However , this temple was made a church in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Vila Borges are incomparable .
Therefore while going to Rome do not forget to see it .
Definitely go to the museum built here as well because by leaving it you will lose the chances of getting rid of the best sculpture .
The statues built here are incomparable and so alive as if they start speaking now .
Here Nepolian ancestor Paulin , whose marriage took place in the Borges royal family , a statue lying on its table looks so alive that you will not be able to stay together for a few moments .
The special attraction of Rome is their flowers .
Here approximately 300 buildings are such in which grand flowers are made .
The most famous flowers here are ' Trivi Foundation ' .
It is believed that if you want to come to Rome some other time then you should put it in a cycle fountain with this desire .
It is believed that by doing this this desire is definitely fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be completed till you can see ' Vetican City ' .
Since the sixth century this place has been the residence of the best religious chief of the followers of Roman Catholic religion Pope .
Although it is in Rome but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
Definitely see the famous St . Peter Church , St . Peter Square , Fountain , Museum etc . of Vetican City .
Of course you will show the scene of a different world and will give you a feeling of always remembering .

If you see in today 's table then for Maldives the fare of returning to the cheapest person from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Male even then you can get hotels in less fare but if you go to any nearby island to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the fare will be small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December the Lui cruise from Kochi started the only C cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Lui cruise is a European company and is very small in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some restrictions Lui cruise has now established its services , but it is likely to be recurring from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three-day cruise at least 5850 rupees per person at the ship of Lui cruise at MV Equamorin .
That is , the fare of one person less than 18 thousand rupees for three days .
And if there are two elders then children less than 15 years of age are completely free .
What else should be done .
The fare of the cruise includes tea , breakfast , food everything .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching Rajdhani Male you can enjoy entertainment , activities available in Maldives from the point of view of your wishes - from sea plane ride to Andrwator lunch .
On roaming around in big airplanes suddenly a sea plane stands in front of you then you will feel like shouting .
But with 12 - 15 seats this island group like Ooty Plain Maldives is undesirable for roaming .
On the surface of water it is not known when it flies in the air running like a speed boat .
You do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes in the entire sunshine .
Every time your eyes keep on looking down from the window , seeing the reservoirs and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
Everything is clearly visible .
There are two sea plan companies in Maldives .
Tross is one of the Maldives , near which there is a sea plan .
If you want you can tour the air for about four thousand rupees -LRB- person hired -RRB- or else the entire sea plan can take on rent for your daily journey -LRB- really big -RRB- .
Otherwise if you go to any island before the Male Island then the journey of the sea plan will be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you might never wish to finish .
The sea plane travels from 12 k . . to 183 k . . -LRB- excellent Mavilavaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and memorable shop of the capital in the Ahmadine Bazar of Malena .
All the selling persons were listening very carefully to the speeches given by the president of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in Copenhagen a day earlier in the world climate conference .
If I am honest then I have not seen any Hindustani listening to the speakings of the presidents or chief minister in such a way .
But when this is the question of the existence of an excellent creation of the earth then such a seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have understood the sittings made inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but on going to Maldives it seems that if nature ' s suppresses it from us then the world will be so much .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
It is not so beautiful in that small country .
When the eyes came towards Jetty to go back from that journey of the market , when they went to the water of the sea walking along with the unforgettable road then it was felt that the people here understand the price of this beauty .
Water was so clear that in the light of the lamppost fish floating in several metres deep were visible with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see some centimeters clearly in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself to be impotent .
While returning to MV aquarium we were roaming in the brain for two hours in the evening spent in the lap .
Corral Riff -LRB- stones of marble -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get stones of marble on the stones on the grave .
Some time before listening to the speech of President Nashid we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the best personality of any country , there was no security personnel far and wide .
Enjoying we were taking photographs of gardens and gardens about fifty metres away spreading hand inside the gates of their bungalows .
Can you think of such a common leader ' s house in India
The information also came to know that the president sometimes crossing the road on foot two blokes further reach his office .
Every thing was astonishing about Maldives .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
It was known that that day was to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to the airport Island .
From there we reached Ranvey 's head cutting on the chair of Trans Maldives .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near Malay then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing from above .
That's what he saw.
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
We had to go to Rangali Island at a distance of one hundred and fifty kilometres from the Cey Plane of Tros Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands falling in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying till a height of approximately thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was the flight to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Connarade Resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali Island we felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no relation with any outside world .
The relationship was also not such that it was difficult to get out like beauty or adornment there .
Tour can also be done on foot or also by battery operated car .
The view of life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was marvellous .
Now we could not easily listen to ourselves from nature nearby , or reached such a place , was unfortunate .
Several metres down from the stairs while descending in the water of the sea we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a food hall .
On all the sides we could see people doing miraculous types of fishes , corals , snowcling and scooba diving .
The imagination of food sitting on decorated tables was to thrill its own .
On coming to this island in Malaythi Sea Plane the fare of seeing and lunch of the underwater is only 47 thousand rupees for one person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to swim in the water of our cattle .
But we knew , that was not possible .
Returning with that desire with a heavy heart sometimes , the cashew will definitely come here on some threshold .
For many days they were planning to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
Since childhood when we were fond of wild life then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 after biking from Khardungla ahead of Pegong lake in Ladakh this was the second lick tour .
On the afternoon of 27 December we started to run from Delhi to Jim Corbett , but the Journal which had come out of Joshurney dumped our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Dussehra from above and bad road in front .
Many times I felt that now I have fallen .
We reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning after doing anything .
Even if we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Amara resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already done .
On that day there was no special program but we came to visit the coast of Kosi before it was cold .
After spending two - three hours there we got out of the Corbett museum , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kms .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
On returning the evening was over .
After deciding from Delhi we had come out that lions roaming open in the jungle would definitely see if I had seen lions all night in dreams .
In the middle of the dark night suddenly I met with a very strong pride and after that the dogs who started fleeing then did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first information of visiting Kaladhungi and Kabert waterfalls came .
Kaladhugi is thirty kilometres away while carbon waterfalls come on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbert Sahib in Kaladhungi where some important things related to his life are kept .
On coming , we got two and a half hours .
Kaladhugi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was coming in this village itself .
On reaching the resort the ride jeepsy was waiting for us .
It has been said that they have arranged for siteping in the number one side bezrani there .
On asking about number one it was said that grasslands there increase and tigers come to this very way to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijra we were given a guide which takes two and a half hundred rupees for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusky elephants , which had long teeth .
I just photographed .
In the middle of this the guide started pursuing the tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
In many places we also saw the marks of their claws but because of not seeing the tiger I was depressed .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind the past of the tiger was morning .
Then I remembered my old friend of Haldwani .
I made it the same phone .
I told him that I am coming to the carbonate .
He asked whether the tiger was seen or not .
His words became like a tire .
I said slowly , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a ride for inside .
