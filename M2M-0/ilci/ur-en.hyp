His tongue looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of the earth and on the other side Gujarat is therefore a mix of both in the language .

The tourism industry considered to be the main source of the administration of Rajasthan is passing both of these far away .
Due to the increasing threats in the world temple and south Asia the head of tourism has been deeply shocked .
From the point of view of tourism a huge reduction has been recorded in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the major states of the country .
New estimates issued recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has come down by more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to the estimates 9 . percent of the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent of the number of foreign tourists has come down .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan , out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 thousand and 14 lakh 77 thousand foreign tourists were included whereas during the year 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 2558691 foreign tourists and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism department are very concerned about this situation .
Sanjay Kushik , the director of Rajputana Holiday Meccarus says that the incidents of world temple and history have badly affected the head of tourism .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even prepare the strong basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that in comparison to the last year the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists from Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the recent years have passed better for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
There was nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , Havelia , Fort , Bawdi , Jungle , everything is the same ancient .
In the area of tourism all governments increase the talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done on this side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the warriors of Janna and Jharkhand have also made the importance of this state on the international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state but he remained confined to papers only .
The example of success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to promote the basic structures of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of settlement , meditation , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one travel unit and two triples on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels are also made thin for many years .
The depth of RTDC in 2008 - 2009 was 185 lakh , which is expected to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 2010 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years 40 percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of corporation are also bringing it a big ghat .
Among them are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists have not been able to attract this train .
Even after reducing it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a deficiency of interest of tourists towards the Pushkar fair .
In the tourist village built on behalf of RTDC in 2007 - 2008 where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , this year this number decreased to 217 .
Among all this it is worthy of patience for RTDC that there is no dearth of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal trains .
This train is continuously providing benefits .
Last year RTDC benefited from this train for nine and a half crore rupees .
With this grasp coming in the tourism department in Rajasthan the scriptures of concern in the field of tourism are natural .
Tourism is the biggest source of economics of Rajasthan .

It is the same moisture that accumulates the whole body .
This is the same Surmai Ujjala in the rainy season .
As soon as the program of Darjeeling journey was cooked , first it was decided to take a view of Kursing .
Kursing is a small city of Darjeeling .
Filled with tea gardens , filled with sunshine .
Famous for the production of excellent tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Silliguri , then initially the tea garden Muscrahat welcomes those who move towards itself .
Crossing through the road in the middle of tea gardens the heart in the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side eat deep greenery .
Sometimes forests and sometimes tea gardens were visible .
All around was the reign of greenery .
Once upon a time I got greenery , see these natural forests or plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The beauty of the forest was , the beautiful gardens of tea spread far and wide .
If we look at the roads of the road then the universe looks unique .
The movement of the snake was going on with tight and narrow paths .
The time was also passing .
If we were not passing , then forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small towns are seen .
There was a lot of dense view from a mountain house , house etc . from far .
This was Kursing .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming all day .
That is why taking a car we got out on a tour of Kursing .
First of all deer park .
A small garden surrounded by large forests all around .
Upper was the climb i . . to reach the deer park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being enchanted with the beauty of Kursing , it has not yet been able to become famous as a tourist place .
Although the city is quite high and clean .
Despite the passage being peaceful we were enjoying the joy of climbing the road between the laxity and sunshine trees to the deer park surrounded by the forests .
The next place was Eggle Kreg .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called socid point .
It is said that the lovers used to know from here in the time of the British .
Nowadays it is decorated with a garden and restaurant .
Here is a staircase cave with the height of which a beautiful view of the whole of the city comes out .
In the tea garden nearby women were busy breaking the tea leaves running hands with a lot of speed on the back .
Cursing is a museum outside the city , but on that day we could not go there because it was more important to roam around the beautiful environment of tea gardens .
The next day Darjeeling had to roam .
It was a charming experience in itself , but there was a great concern about it that if rains like this then how would we roam .
But it was very high that on reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the sports sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On growing a little more below from here we found Ghera Gangamaya from the hills .
Here the shadow of waterfalls amidst rocks is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that waterfalls are loving in the regime of rocks and rocks here then the splendor of waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are located very low the brightness of the hills of Darjeeling .
After climbing up with the help of the vehicle in Darjeeling we saw the Batsia Loop .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durbin .
The nature of the weather was still cold .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , from where to get down and started shouting .
In the evening make a program to roam around Malrod and shopping .
In the tour of Darjeeling the Toy Trains put a lot in the journey .
The journey from Darjeeling to tour and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Here boating and a little rest in the garden in Merik lake .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where sweets made of hands of Nepalese artisans etc . are found .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also available .
Kalimpong is such a city of Darjeeling district , but its shape is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but also the arrival of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot of Kalimpong is Lava and Lolegaon , which is filled with forest waterfalls .
But in the deficiency of time we could not get jumping this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shadows of winters , on the tour of Darjeeling , tea garden spread till Darjeeling from Silliguri here tied me with us .
A small journey of my recent times was very interesting and surprising .
This journey was neither of the country nor outside Rajasthan but from Jaipur very close .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself , in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , a ship of water or any railway or a royal train or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come pulling .
The place where I am going is ready for about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation with which this place has come there he has actually melted in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
My guide in my ears sings the words of Ram Babumina , we could not even think before that that we could stay like this in the jungle .
50 percent stop is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people could not even work in the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu dwelling in Ajmergarh used to work earlier in Jaipur and now in the peace garden with this unique royal style .
He has shook his speaking in a new color .
There is a feeling of peace park .
There nobody calls you by speaking English .
Shanti Bagh is actually peaceful and peaceful tourist spot .
This garden has its own history as well and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you from the surrounding areas .
Among those who spend holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people would have to travel to Bhangdur of Bhutan , why do you go away , some of the people of Jaipur may have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of Shanti Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night as well when the Digestive Dayana had called me there with heart but I could not go .
This thing is different that he had reached Manghar by taking a walk on his own .
This time suddenly when I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guests , then I felt that those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Shanti Bagh .
This garden is the only garden which is saved from these seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in 1980 .
Its old wall is witness to these days .
The first glimpse of Shanti Bagh in the shadow of mountains and dense trees attracts you .
As soon as you come in , the way you are treated , it feels that a lot of attention has been given to spiritual peace here .
Along with binding muley in Kalai the lifetime of the Mangalore entrance is done .
We reached slopy evening and we decided to put a cycle of this garden .
My guest , Jaiki , who is a decorative expert , is suddenly advancing it is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are affected .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
Everything is new , no wonder that Shanti Bagh has got a reward even recently .
Maneger fixed our program in the morning .
First of all walking with Ram Babu and then journey of jeep of Bhanggarh .
On walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajmergarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
Look at the dry lake in which the woods were treasuring .
This year there was no rain but for the first time the smoke field was seen .
For Jaiki there was such a unique experience of the life of the village .
After that we reached Bhangdra from jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is the Melan dollar incomplete bridge .
Even the traditional method of saying the abundance of peace park and opening curd he promised us .
Now it was understood that why do tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show triple life .
Is it right
Popular and such is not in many states and tourists also show special interest in them .
This tour is usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , eating etc .
This way there is an attempt to expose such places where there has not been much progress and there has not been a special effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides this attention is paid only on doing trident cosine .
Actually the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists aware of the lifestyle and tradition of this place .
Although it looks a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and experience a different kind .
Just the tour has its own joy .
With this despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time by describing your favorite book .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving less expensive and comfortable plenty of time these tours definitely demand you patience .
This is the reason why it is important to take care of some things to enjoy them , especially when you are watching through any foreign destination bus tour .
Find best deal before taking tickets .
Students , friends of militia , children etc get discount on them , then there is also an arrears of release for two people .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in advances , therefore it is better to make a bus tour in the last moments that you do planning a little earlier .
Instead of two w tickets know about Round trips .
It gets delicate .
Regulations are extremely difficult by taking bags , so ask about the size and weight of the goods .
There is no such thing that you have to leave some of your luggage at the traminal or you have to pay different fees .
Also know the rules of insurance or loss filling up from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , walk on .
Because they get corrected in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during tour the responsibility of the goods will be yours .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During muscular season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the best seat choice will be with you .
While selecting the seat keep in mind comfortable .
If there will be more strokes on the previous seat , then reading on the seats ahead is not comfortable .
If you have to go again and again , then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more distressed then the window set will be better for you .
Now talk of a walking .
If you are in the forefront of both the palms then sit on a corner seat beforehand and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of vasroom in bus , then while selecting a seat keep in mind this thing as it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identity with just drive and conductor .
This way you will get enough information from them .
During the cleaning of bus all are called to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat because on its disappearance only those who do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever you stay , return back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can find a new traveller in your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

Situated in Panaji the capital of Goa , the Jinger Hotel makes this journey of the western coast very excellent .
On the roads of Goa , cycling , reverse , cold sea winds and the enjoying enjoyment of world famous golden food are the best options to spend a comfortable day here .
If you see in today 's history then for Maldives the cheapest person returns to Maldives is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Malay then even then you can get hotels in some less fare but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then pocket will become small .
Securities prove to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December , Louiscus from Kochi started the single series of India for Maldives and Columbus .
Louiscus is a European company and is a village named Kaffee in Cruise and Hotel Biopar .
Although due to some problems Louiscus has now closed its services , but they are expected to start from October .
At least 5850 rupees per person can go to Maldives for a three-day cruise at the price of the ship of Louiscus at Amvi Examine .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if you are two big then the children below the age of 15 years are completely free .
What else should be done .
The fare of cruise includes tea , breakfast , food all .
Every time with entertainment .
On reaching Rajdhani Male you can enjoy entertainments , activities available in Maldeo according to your pocket - from syphilin riding to interwaterlands .
While roaming around in big airplanes suddenly a syphilin stands in front of you then you will feel like an opening .
But with 12 - 15 seats this is undoubtedly excellent for visiting Orchipelago -LRB- specimen -RRB- like Tonowtropline Maldeo .
While running like a speed boat on the surface of water it does not know when it rises in the air .
You do not estimate the flight of ordinary airplanes in the entire flight .
Every time your eyes are visible from the window - seeing the blue water of different shades of Maldives , the reservoirs and the coral islands .
Everything looks so clear .
There are two syphilin companies in Maldives .
Transmal Devine is one of them near which are 20 seplines .
If you want you can roam around the air for about Rs . -LRB- per person -RRB- or you can take the entire syphilis on rent for your entire day -LRB- especially deep pocket -RRB- .
If you go to any island away from the Malay Island then it would be necessary to travel to Selein because this is the medium of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey whose heart might never end you .
From 12 kms to 183 kms -LRB- excellent Mavilivaru -RRB- of Sipeline travels in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest Antique and Swineer shop of the capital in the Ahmadi Bazar of Malay .
All the cells were listening with great care to the speech given by the chief of Maldeo Mohammad Nasad in Copenhagen .
With honesty I did not see any Indian president or prime minister ' s speech so seriously .
But when there is a question of the existence of a rare creation of this land then it was so serious .
Many people may have considered the sitting inside the water by the Maladeo cabinet in October , but by going to Maldeo it seems that if we take it away from us then how poor the world will become .
This is something special in the beauty there .
In this small country as if the beauty does not end .
To go back from this journey of the market to your cruise , when the eyes suddenly went to the water of the sea along with the road then it feels as if the people here understand the price of this beauty .
Water was so clear that the fish floating in the depths of several metres below the light of the lamppost were visible with all its colors .
This was the part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see some centimetres clearly in the water of the sea or river settled in any city of India then you will find yourself happy .
While returning to E . . . Merien we were roaming in mind for two hours in the evening spent in Mala .
Koral Rif -LRB- Monga Chatins -RRB- is the life here .
Here you will also get mong chains on stones attached to the graveyards .
Some time before listening to the speeches of the chief snack we were standing outside their government residence .
It was not believed that we had no protector worker far and wide ahead of the residence of the best personality of any country .
With fun we were pulling the footsteps of gardens and fountains just 50 metres away after increasing the hand inside its gates .
Can you think of this about the house of some poor leader of India
It was also known that sometimes the chief goes to his office two blocks while crossing the road on foot .
Every thing about Maldeo was surprising .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
Allahabad was that day was going to be special .
From morning cruise a boat brought us an airport island .
From there we reached the Trans Maldevan by cutting the rock of Ranve .
Last evening when the cruise was approaching Malay then we immediately recognized the syphilis passing from above .
The pictures which were seen , of that .
But then it was not finished that the next day there would be a chance of riding in it .
We were going to Rangali Island one hundred five kilometres away from the Sipeline of Transmal Diu .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldeo from Sippleon flying up to a height of approximately one thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
He was a breathing flight with romantic and emotion .
But on the Rangali island after reaching the Coordinate of Hilton Hills we felt as if we had reached another world .
In such a world , which had no contact with any world outside .
The relation was not so much that it was difficult to get out of the beauty of the place .
Tour can also be done on foot on the Konark or also by a vehicle running from the battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from GT to the special island was unique .
Now we were unable to take care of ourselves from the nature of nearby , that we reached such a place , was unconscious .
While descending in the water of the sea several metres down from the stairs we reached such a room of shade which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides we can see a strange kind of small fish , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving .
The thought of eating sitting on the decorated tables there was very surprising in itself .
On coming to this island from Malay to Sepplein it has been made to see and lunch in the intervals only 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to flow in our passport water .
But we knew , it was not possible .
We returned with the same hope that we will come here sometimes , sometimes at some point of time .
For many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of the work it was not possible .
Since childhood if we had the desire to live life then why should we go to جمcarboat this time
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking till the Chirdung lake ahead of Khardungla pass in Laddakh .
On the morning of 27th December we left for Jammu Corbett , but the joy that we had come out of the joy and rumour , sorry roamed our speed .
The journey between Hapad and Gajraula was really tired .
From Upper to Korra and bad road in front .
Many times it felt that now it fell .
Somehow reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in Dhikki near our resort park , whose booking we had already done .
On that day there was no special program but we went to visit the coast of Kosi before despite the cold .
After spending two - three hours there we went out the Corbett Museum , which was near Dhangdi Gate two kilometres away from difficulty .
From there we went to Ramnagar roaming down .
Returned late evening .
The tigers roaming in the jungle would definitely see the lion roaming in the jungle , then the tigers kept watching me all night in the dream .
Suddenly I heard a lot of noise amidst the darkness of the night and after that the dogs who began to crush then did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first came the advice of roaming black pepper and carbohydrate fault .
Kaladangi is 30 kilometres away while carbohydrate falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kaladangi where some important things related to their life are kept .
Returning , we got 12 .
Kaladangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this village itself .
On reaching the resort the ride ipsi was enjoying us .
It was told that he had arranged for siteing in the number one site Barrani there .
On asking about number one it was said that there is more grassland and the tigers come to Usi to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bajrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for roaming around four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we had two twisted elephants , whose long teeth were .
I collected photography .
Meanwhile the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , out of which the leopards have died recently .
In many places we also saw signs of their claws , but because of not being able to see the tiger I was very excited .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the tiger was successfully riding .
Then came the memory of one of his old friends of the humorous Haldwani .
I put such a phone .
I told him that I have come in carbohydrate .
He did not see the tiger .
His words were kissed like swimming .
I did not say gradually .
There was no permission to take a box in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a ride inside .
