In the last 8 years, there has been a serious question to Chief Minister Edpadi Funnisamy about how many of the obstacles made in the supreme regime.
In a statement issued by the party's stakeholder, Turaimurugan, criticised the first person that he was unaware of any information about the public service.
In his statement, DMK spokesman Duraimurugan said that the water that opens in Kawaire was mixed in the sea in the absence of the ATMK government and the lack of administrative ability.
Our leader, M.K. Stalin, expressed his concern over the responsibility of the opposition leader of the Tamilnadu legislature, that he had no plans for the ATMK government to suspend it on the way to Kaveri pass.
Speaking to the first person, Edpadi Funnisamy said, 'DMK Vinnar, who has complained to us, questioned whether he had a stoppage in Kaveri in his regime.'
'I want him to say, we have set up a ban on the League regime at Cauvery in the DMK regime.
Without knowing about this, will the public service department also be responsible for the fact that the chief minister, Edpadi Punisamy, speaks out of the truth
The blockade in Mayanur increased the water level of the land in that area.
That's why agriculture was sweet.
Hence, thousands of people of the peasantry in the region, which is still useful today, will be able to enjoy thanks to the League government for ever.
As required for the time being, the harvest was set up by the League state in Mayanur.
Then there was no need to build further restrictions.
If necessary, the artists who were the then priests would have given their immediate permission and suspended the funds and suspended the work.
Hence, there is no neighbourhood to reduce the League's state in commenting on Kavir's health.
I hear how many restrictions have you been built in Kaveri in the last eighties of the ATMK regime
Others question: We have built more than 40 dams in Tamilnadu during the Tigamu regime.
Can you indicate that this is the only dam built in the ATMK regimes
Don't lie.
If the opposition leader had replied to their charge - we are building a detention or planning to build at these places.
Talking outwardly about the fact that the TMK was uncontrolled in the regime in Kaveri, it would be nice if it was to ask for an individual slave, and for the post of chief minister who played it, I am obliged to point out that it was not a civilisational act, but rather beautiful.'

Are you handing over the old tribal politics in Tamilnadu
In Tamilnadu, however, it is said that the caste politics will be taken in the hands of the people, so that it cannot be cleaned and embraced anywhere in Tamilnadu.
When Modi was the prime minister for the first time, he was in a position to drive away from Tamilnadu.
After this, Amitsha denounced the 2st time, i.e., during the election, "What are you supposed to do," he said.
But in the 5 constituencies of the rivalry, the soil was overwhelmed.
Though the whole country is shiny, there is a wave of protest in Tamilnadu.
Beyond all this, Muthalak, Kashmir affair, Hindi submission and one country is the only language.
If all this is accumulated, it is yet to be found in the clue.
That is why the Bajaka leadership is in the seizure on the Rajapakse executives of Tamilnadu and that is why there has been unsuccessful complications to even appoint the state leadership.
Even if this is one side, there is a plan to seize the people in Tamilnadu in any way in the forthcoming assembly elections.
For this, it appears that the Bajaka leadership has come to an end through direct floor reports and intelligence reports.
Accordingly, even though it is superior, the fact that two Dravida parties are not sufficiently important for the people of Nadar and the Veneers and the people of Devendra Kula volunteers is in the midst of the social people.

I have decided to enforce or enforce the social race, to give me a position.
This is how Saundararaj's appointment to Tamil Eelam as Telangana Governor.

Moreover, no matter whatsoever, this caste politics will suppose to the Pazhagka.
At the same time, when Tamilnadu has already been small in caste politics, it is not known whether these functions of the Bajaga would be like adding more oil to the burning island.
If such a caste fire starts to crush, it is true that a little bit of flourished in Tamilnadu will be swollen in the same island.
