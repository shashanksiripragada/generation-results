Manki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namskar
Shatrun Buddhist mosquitoes
I am bowed down with such Divya Jyotis .
What can be better idea than this to keep in mind that we pray everywhere to spread light , spread positiveness and destroy the feeling of enmity .
Today Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world .
The special thing is that not only Indian groups are included in this but now the governments of many countries , the citizens of the country , the social organizations there celebrate Diwali with full joy .
In a way the ' Bharat ' shapes there .
Festival tourism in the world , friends used to attract themselves .
Our country , which is the country of values , has a lot of chances of festival tourism .
Whether Holi , Diwali , Onam , Pongal , Beihu , by spreading such qualities we should try to include other states , people of other countries as well .
To us there are so many different festivals in each state , each region - people from other countries have a lot of juice in it .
Therefore in increasing the festival tourism in India the role of Indians living in the country is extremely important .
My beloved countrymen , in the past ' mother ' s daughter-in-law ' or in the middle of the day some stirring would have been unsuccessful .
I used to say . Let us celebrate this Diwali as the women ' s strength and success of India , that is , the honor of Laxmi of India .
And seem to be seen , immediately after that , innumerable inspiring stories were felt in social media .
Varangal has written on the Namo App by the Kodipaka Ramesh here that my mother is my strength .
In 1990 when my elders were subjected , my mother only raised the responsibility of five children .
Today we are in good business of five brothers .
Rameshji, my admiration to your parents
Geetika Swami Yinch , who is active on Twitter , believes that for them there are Laxmi of India on Major Khushboo , who are the wells of a bus driver and they used to be the leader of all women of Assam Rifles .
For poetry triwariji the Laxmi of India is their description , which is also their strength .
They have the respect of their best paintings .
He has also achieved a very good category in the test of CLAT .
While Megh Jain has written , an elderly woman of 92 years is giving free water to travellers at Gwalior railway station .
Meghazi has been very inspired in the sense of humility and doing of Laxmi in India .
Many such stories have been told by people .
You must take care of it , inspiration and do some such work in your surrounding area also .
I am saluted with respect to all these Lakshmis of India .
My dear countrymen, the famous poet of 17th century, Sanchi Honamma, wrote a poem in the 17th century, Kannada language.
That very emotion , that word which we are talking about every Laxmi of India , does not seem to be , its legacy was completed in 17th century itself .
How beautiful words , how beautiful feelings and how good ideas are included in this poem in Kannada language .
Our daughters , these are our glory and because of the month of these daughters , there is a strong identity of our society and that is the future .
My dear countrymen , 21 November , 219 - This is the day on which 350 or light festivals of Shri Gurunanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world .
The effect of Gurunak Devji is not only in India but also in the whole world .
In many countries of the world our Sikh brothers and sisters have actually performed , who are fully dedicated to the ideals of the goddess .
I can never forget my meeting between the gurus of Venkuvar and Tehran .
There is such a lot about Mr . Gurnak Devji , which I can tell you , but for that there will be a lot of part of the mother 's mother ' .
He always kept the service system the best place .
Girunak Devji believes that there is no thinness of the service servants who have earned freely .
He stood for a long time in socially bad ways like untouchability .
Mr . Gurunak Devji sent his message to the world , far away .
He was among the most travellers in his time .
He went to many places and wherever he went , because of his direct nature , humility , patience he humbled everyone 's mind .
Gurunanak Devji made many important religious visits, which were called as sadness.
Taking the message of goodwill and equality , whether it is north , south , east , west , everywhere , people , saints and sages met .
The famous Santa Shankardev of Assam had also taken inspiration from them , as well .
He travelled to the holy land of Haridwar .
While going to Bidar in Karnataka , Gurunak Devji had broken the water there on the problem .
In Bidar there is a famous place named Gurnanak Jira Sahab , which reminds us of the Gurunanak Devji , is dedicated to them only .
During a sadness , Gurunakji also travelled in the north , Kashmir and its surrounding areas .
This has established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Gurunanak Devji also went to Tibet , where people considered him as a guru .
They are also worshipped in Uzbekistan where they had gone .
During one of his sadness , he also traveled to Islamic countries , including Saudi Arabia , Iran and Afghanistan .
He stayed in the minds of millions of people who have complete faith follow their teachings and are doing even today .
Just a few days back , the kingdom of about 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar .
At the same time he would see the golden temples of Amritsar and this incident became the 550 light festival of Gurunak Devji .
All these princes take a view of the Golden Temple from there , apart from this they got the opportunity to know about Sikh tradition and culture .
After this many princes put photographs on Soshal Media and also wrote gloriously about good experiences .
This is my wish to give us more inspiration to bring their thoughts and ideals to the 350th light of Gurunaka Devji .
My beloved brothers and sisters , I believe that on 31st October this star has remained in the memory of all of us .
This day is the birth anniversary of the Iron man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel of India which was great to encircle the country in the threshold of hearing .
On the other hand , there was a unique ability to bring people together between Sardar Patel , on the other hand with whom they had ideological distinction , they also settle with them a good match .
Sardar Patel also used to watch small things in very open way , take a look at them .
True meaning that is the ' Man of Dettels ' which holds the head of the penis .
Along with this he was sufficient in union council .
Thousands of representatives from all over the country were coming to participate in the conference of Congress in Ahmedabad in 1921 .
The responsibility of all the arrangements of the administration was on Sardar Patel .
They used this opportunity to improve the system of water supplying to the city .
There will not be deficiency of water to anyone , it has been decided .
Not only this , they had the precaution of going to a commodity luggage or pair of shoes at the place of the administration and considering this we will feel very surprised to know what they call .
Together with the fields they made khadi pushwa , such a gloriousness .
The farmers made such pushes and sold the resistants .
Wear your shoes in these puppets and keeping that puppet with us the tension of going in the mind of the resistance has gone out .
On the other hand , the sale of khadi increased a lot .
We will always be thankful towards our country , Sardar Patel for playing a specific role in the combination .
They should do important work only to fix basic rights , due to which there was no arrangement of any distinction on the basis of caste and community .
Friends , the first Home Minister of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has collected institutions , for a very great pride and historical work .
This is the speciality of Sardar Vallabhbhai .
Actually when we talk about the efforts of Sardar Patel then in the integration of the country there was talk of their geography about some special provinces .
He told Mudliar brother , Arkot Ramswamy Mudliar and Arkot Laxmanaswamy Mudliar , he should take the people of Thiruvananthapuram there and throw the tricolor there and throw the first tricolor in Lakshadweep .
The tricolor was torn immediately after their instructions and the minds of the neighbouring country to capture Lakshadweep was destroyed .
Or after the deterioration Sardar Patel told Mudaliyar that every necessary help will be available for the development of Lakshadweep , which he has to eat personally .
Today , Lakshadweep is giving an important contribution to the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope we will tour these beautiful islands and sea shores .
My beloved countrymen , on 31 October , 218 the effigy of united in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the country and the world .
This is the highest effigy of the world .
The statue of freedom goddess in America is double its height .
The highest statue of the world fills every Indian with respect .
The value of each Indian is deep .
We will enjoy that in one year , more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the effigy of unity .
This means that everyday six and a half thousand people will see the grandeur of the effigy of unity .
He expressed the faith , faith in his heart about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now there are many attractions like select gardens , fountain parks , forest safari , nutritious diet parks for children , unity nursery , and due to this the local economy is being run and people are getting new opportunities of employment as well .
Considering the facilities of tourists coming here , people of many villages are providing such facilities in their homes , home stairs .
Commercial training is also being given to the people providing home status facilities at home .
While the people there started the farming of dragon fruits as well , I believe it will soon be the main source of the livelihood of the people there .
Friends , for the country , for all the states , for the tourism industry , can be a subject of unity puppet exercise .
We are all witnesses of any place , world famous tourist spot developed in a year .
There people come from the country and abroad .
Many such arrangements of transportation , blockage , guide , environmental supplementary system are developing automatically after one .
There is a huge economic stir and people are making facilities according to the needs of travellers .
The government is influencing its role .
Friends , in the last month Time month among the 100 important tourist places of the world the elephant of unity is leading to this place .
I hope to see the effigy of unity from all of us taking out some time from our precious time .
But my aim is that every Indian who takes the time of traveling , take the journey of at least 15 tourist places in India with families , wherever he goes , wherever he stays at night , this my aim will be maintained .
Mitrano , as you know , every year from 214 to 31 October is celebrated as national unity day .
This day by giving us any price he instructs us to protect unity , integrity and security of our country .
On 31 October , like every year , run for unity is being organised .
In this every section of society , every level of people will be included .
Run for unity is the same thing that this country is one . walking on one side and watching it getting a goal .
Even so , on seeing this day a hole and width is seen in people regarding marathon .
Run for unity is also such a glimpse .
Here we are also running , for Fit India and along with it we are being associated with the goals of an India - best India .
And by this not only the body but the mind and culture have run India for the unity of India , at a new height .
For this in the city where you are staying you can get information about Run for unity around you .
The place where Run for unity is going to be organised on this portal in the country has been informed of those places .
We will all run on 31st October - for the unity of India , even for our sake .
My beloved countrymen , Sardar Patel tied the country in the brink of unity .
This mantra of unity is like a version in our life and in every country of variety like India , on every road , on every side , on every side , we should keep on giving this mantra of unity to our unity .
Our society has always been extremely active and alert to capture the unity and harmony of my dear countrymen , unity of the country and the mutual harmony .
Friends , I remember that in September 2001 when the high courts of Allahabad had given their time at the birthplace of Rama .
If that day is remembered , how was the atmosphere .
How many people of different types had come to the ground .
How the heat related groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation .
What kind of language was being made to fever the environment .
In different voices attempts were also made to fill tactics .
On the other hand everything was going on to fever the atmosphere for two weeks , but when Ram came to the birthplace then the government , state bird , social organization , citizen society , representative of all the sects , sadhu community gave a very restraint reaction .
Try to reduce stress in the environment .
But even today I remember that day .
These things should always be kept in mind that they give us a lot of strength .
The solar of unity gives strength to the country , this is the example .
My beloved countrymen, on October 31, the execution of our Maji Pathpread Indira Gandhi was on the same day.
There was a big shock to the country , even today I offer tribute to them .
My beloved countrymen , today some stories are heard at home , one story of every village is heard from far , whatever stories are heard from north to south , east to west , every corner of India , then it is clean .
Every person , every family , seem to tell every village its pleasant experience in the matter of cleanliness , because this effort of cleanliness is an attempt of hundreds of crore Indians .
The merchants of their consequences are also 100 crore Indians .
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
If I hear, I think, then tell us too.
Let us imagine that the world ' s highest battlefield where the temperature slips from zero to zero to zero degrees .
In the air the virus remains in the name itself .
Staying in such a difficult situation is also not less than sufficient .
In such a bad situation our elders are protecting the borders of the country by pressing their chest , but they are running clean Siachen campaigns there .
For this unique complexity of Indian Lashkar I praise the people of the country .
Thank you .
There is so much cold that some disturbances are also difficult .
In such a situation , dissolution and arrangement of waste is an important task .
In such a situation , 130 tons away from the glacier and its surrounding area and that too is such a delicate environment , how big is this service .
Everyone knows that Siachen is such a part which is the source of rivers and clean water .
Therefore the meaning of running the cleaning campaign here is to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower parts along with it the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok .
My dear countrymen , festivals are a new magnificent mountain in our entire life .
And in the day , especially in every family some or the other things are being brought from the market .
As much as we try to buy local things , as much as possible 150 will become a great opportunity .
And I am inclined to buy something made of hands of our marketers , somehow we want to buy .
Even in this day , before Diwali we must have bought a lot .
But there are many people who would think that if they go after Diwali then something would be cheaper .
There are many such people whose shopping remains even more .
While blessings of Deepawali I led us , this is why we can buy local things as well as for shopping of local things .
How important role can be seen in the dream of Mahatma Gandhi .
But sometimes there is burning on remaining unconscious .
Somewhere wound occurs .
I love all of us , take care of themselves and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm .
Mann's bat, September 2018
Every Indian , whether it is any area , caste , religion , religion or language , it is always ready to express joy to its soldiers , to express their happiness and to express their reading .
Tomorrow the auspicious Indians of India celebrated Parakram festival .
The goal of diversity done in 2016 was to remember when the warriors snatched by the opponents of dictatorship would be snatched by their soldiers .
In different parts of the country , your cheap ball , performances have been filled so that the country ' s maximum number of citizens , especially the young ladies can be known as their potential .
How capable we are and how do we protect our countrymen by putting our soldiers ' life ' .
Day like Parakram Parva reminds young men of the pride of their armed party and also inspires us to maintain unity and integrity of the country .
I also participated in a program in Jodhpur of Rajasthan .
It is certain that the soldiers who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country will give their soldiers the solution .
We believe in calmness and for it we are committed to encouragement , we are not at all able to squeeze just glorify and square the price of the country 's harmony .
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace .
This was a sympathy done by our soldiers towards calmness .
Even today the speed of connected nations is one of the most soldiers sending countries in the country of different peace .
For decades our soldiers have played an important role in playing the peacefulness of the world by wearing blue helmet .
The thing of sky is different from my loved countrymen .
In the Prajasattaka day program one of the people who have the desire is ' Flay Post ' in which their air force shows the humility of their capabilities by making leopard air passes .
On October 8 we celebrate the airplane day .
I enjoy all the air services served for the country and their families .
In 1947 when Pakistani Hallekhorani started unprecedented movement , Indian soldiers and materials used to eat it by the air force to reach time in the battlefield of Srinagar .
In 1965 the air force also sucked enemy .
Who does not even know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh between 1971
Air Force has also played an important role in freeing Kargil from horse riding in the middle of 1999 .
On Tiger Hill , the airplane smokeed them while raining at the shelters of enemy .
Whether it is help and rescue work or danger management , the country is thankful for the admirable workforce of these virgins of your air force .
From Vadal , Pur to Agni in the jungle their work is unique to fulfil natural hazards and to help the people of the country .
In order to ensure equality of men and women in the country also the air force has created ideals , they have opened the doors of each of their department for girls .
Now along with the ' Short Service Commission ' the airplane is also giving the option of ' Permanent Commission ' , which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year .
India can concentrate on the fact that along with the strength of man in our armed group there is also the contribution of women 's strength .
Women are strong only now they are getting cheaper .
My beloved countrymen , in the last few days Naudala 's own authority was giving a bow to Tommy , life-threatening .
The whole country was worried about how to save them .
We all know that Abhilash Tommy is a religious heroic prince .
From any modern technique the journey of the world taking a small name is the first Indian official .
Since last 80 days, in the Southern Indian Ocean, to participate in the Golden Globe race, he used to stretch out his speed in the sea, just to create trouble in front of them with the dangerous sea swords, this bravery of Indian boat has been swinginging in sea for many days.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and that is the same courage , their strength , their strength and the incomparable strength to live will definitely inspire the youth of our country .
My beloved countrymen , on 2 October this day only little children also know what is important for our country .
On 2 October of this year there is more special importance .
From now on we have been doing many programs worldwide with the destination of 150 years of Mahatma Gandhiji .
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi inspired the whole world .
Whether Dr . Martin Luther King Jews or Nelson Mandela , such a great scholar , has achieved strength from Gandhi ' s views and has been able to give a long struggle to our people the harmony and glory .
I want to discuss one more important work of my worshippers from today 's mother-in-law , which most people should know .
In the middle of 1941 Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive program .
After that in 1945 he insisted on the freedom struggle that time he prepared a recognition of these thoughts .
On the subjects like worshipped fathers , fielders , villages , protecting the rights of workers , cleanliness , spread of education their thoughts have been kept in front of the countrymen .
It is also called ' Gandhi Charter ' .
The worshippers were folk collectors.
It was the speciality of the fathers to connect people , to mix them , then their nature would be .
Everybody must have experienced their arsenal speciality at any time .
He gave everyone this experience that that person is the most important and peaceful person for the country .
The same is the biggest contribution in freedom fight that they will give this fight the form of mass movement .
In the movement of freedom fights the people of every section of the society will bow themselves to the resource of Mahatma Gandhi .
The father had given us all an inspirational mantra .
So can he gain control over his life and part...
How many people can get Swaraj from this , who are fast and their soul is untouched...
Then you will find that your doubts have started decreasing and ego has started ending .
A mantra of Gandhiji , my dear countrymen , is equally important even today .
Today the middle class is increasing in the country , their increasing economic strength , increasing purchasing power , some shopping can we remember fathers for a moment .
Whoever is lucky , which has a direct or indirect benefit from this shopping .
If the poor poor gets benefit then I will get more enjoyment .
Keeping in mind this mantra of Gandhiji in the coming days whatever we buy , while celebrating Gandhiji ' s 150 Y . . Jayanti we must keep in mind that some country should go to build because of our shopping and in that also those who have lost their sweat , have used their money , their patience , all of them should be benefited in some form .
This is the mantra of Gandhiji , this is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that in the life of the poorest and weakest person this small step can become bigger .
But this became good , India got freedom .
That is why today we can feel that even with this small work my country ' s economic progress , economic efficiency , strength to fight the poor against poverty can play a major role .
This is the true patriotism in today 's era , this is the work of worshipping fathers .
They say that all these khadi clothes have been prepared very carefully , every dhaga should come into use .
The spirit of self-confidence towards the countrymen and the spirit of affection towards the countrymen was filled with the destruction of the glory of this childhood .
Two days , along with the jyanti of the worshippers , we are also celebrating the jyanti of the artists .
As soon as the name of scientists is high we come to the heart of Indians the feeling of unlimited faith .
Their beauty is always a respect for every countrymen .
The speciality of Red Bahadur Sastry was that from outside it was very humble but from mind it was as strong as the mountain .
Jai Jawan , Jai Kisan , their declaration is the identity of this unique personality .
This was the result of his unsuccessful penance of the nation that in the less than one and a half years he gave the people and farmers of the country the mantra to reach the peak of success .
My dear countrymen , today we are reminding of worshipped fathers , then it is natural that you will not stay without talking about cleanliness .
This campaign was started from 15th September to the quietness of this service .
Many people participated in this and the fate of luck in the students of the Ambedkar school in Delhi was beneficial .
I went to that school whose foot was taken by my worshipper Babasaheb .
People in all the levels of the country participated in 13 or 13 wheels or ceremonies .
The institution also participated in the torture Hiri .
Shailya students, college students, NCCs, NSS, youth unions, media gates, private industry, all of them have a lot of cleaning work.
I enjoy the lover of all these cleansing lovers .
My beloved countrymen , the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the whole world about which everybody is speaking .
At this time India is organising the biggest world cleaning combination in history . Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Convention i . . Mahatma Gandhi International Convention .
The cleaning ministry of the world and the experts in this area together are distressing their use and experience towards cleanliness .
The conclusion of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention is going on with the beginning of the 150 business Jayanti festival of the fathers on 2 October , 218 .
My beloved countrymen , there is a saying among Sanskrit , Nyayamools are justified on the root of Swaraj , when there is talk of justice then the feeling of human rights is included in it .
It is especially unnecessary for the freedom , peace and justice of the absorbed people .
In the contract given by Babasaheb Ambedkar it has been decided to protect the basic rights of the poor .
Inspired from their own point of view the National Human Rights Commission i . . National Human Rights Commission , NHRC was established on 12 October 1993 .
In some days NHRC is completed 25 years .
NHRC has worked to increase human talent along with the protection of human rights .
Your favorite leader , the maji patriot of the country Atal Bihari Bajpayee had made it clear that human rights are not a traditional conception for us .
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Activity all the buildings in the Vedic period are enshrined .
NHRC has created widespread awareness towards human rights , alongside it has also played a pleasant role in preventing its misuse .
In this journey of 25 years this program has created an atmosphere of hope and faith among the countrymen .
I believe this is an ideal thing for a healthy society , for the best public educational children .
Today along with the human rights activity of the national level 26 state human rights activity has also been established .
In the form of a society there is a need to understand and bring the importance of human rights in conduct , this is the basis of ' literature , development ' .
This year also , in your village , city , in the metropolis , organise ' Run for unity ' .
For unity this is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for unity throughout his life .
I inspire all of us to sacrifice our efforts to encircle each class , every part of the country in the field of unity through the medium of ' 31 October , ' Run For University ' , this will make them a good devotion .
For my dear countrymen , Navaratri , Durga Puja , Vijayadashmi or all sacred festivals we give us many luxuries .
Thank you
Man's August 20018
Today the festival of Rakshin Poornima is being celebrated throughout the country .
Or very nice to all the people of the holy day.
This festival is celebrated as a symbol of love and belief among the elders and brothers .
Now Janmashtami is also being celebrated soon .
On the other hand , the atmosphere of such a horse , horse , palanquin , jay Kanhailal , Govinda-Govinda ' is going to be very heavy .
The joy of getting colored in the color of Lord Shri Krishna is somewhat flameless .
Good time Sanskrit - Dinmasti.
Sanskrit languages are the best words.
Along with the demonstration , the day of Shravana Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit day .
At the same time from Vedic times to present Sanskrit language also has a very important role in the spread of knowledge , we also feel Indians assume it .
In Sanskrit language and literature of this language knowledge about every field of life is as if it is a treasure .
Not only this , however , the words of the present worldly problem have been discussed , the mentions of the comprehensive Northern Deena -LRB- Uttra -RRB- Mantras are in Sanskrit language as well .
Residents in Mattur or village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka state use Sanskrit language even today , knowing this will definitely enjoy ourselves .
One speciality in Sanskrit language is that we will be surprised to know that innumerable words can be created in this language .
How important we have in life , it is clearly said in the official language that once aksharmastu , guru , disciples are in question .
My beloved countrymen , immense hardships , hard works , adventurous rains are bringing new hopes for their fielders .
Because of heavy heat this rain gives rise to sand , dried trees and plants , stiff reservoirs .
But sometimes it brings extremely destructive , adventurous Mahapura .
In the country there has been excessive rains in comparison to other places .
Those people who have been injured in these natural hospitals , their nature will improve soon , I pray such a way .
But even during such a crisis the sight of humanity keeps on happening to us .
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari everybody can help those people who are possible at their own level , then such dangers may be between Kerala or in any other districts of India .
To save the lives of the people trapped in Pura they tried untiringly without keeping any kind of effort .
Whether there is aeroplane , along with it the soldiers of the locality , border security forces , CISF , RAF , every department of Sania has played an important role in the work of rescue and help .
In this sacred period of Onam , we prayed that the country , especially the Kerala , will get the power to get out of this crisis as soon as possible and the development of Kerala will get better speed .
According to all the countrymen I once again want to give confidence to the people of Kerala and the places where there is such a crisis in the country , that the whole country is with us .
For the last ten years he had gone far from active state .
But after August 16 the country and the world saw , even after this ten years of age in the minds of the common man in India there was immense affection about Atlaji .
India will always be thankful about Atlaji for the 91st reform authority 2003 .
Due to this change two important changes have come in the kingdom of India .
The first thing is that the size of the state cabinet has been limited to 15 percent of the total assembly seats .
Second thing , the limits fixed under the opposition law were one third , it was increased to two thirds .
In order to decipher its partner , clear direction has also been determined .
Atlaji was a loyal country.
During their work time the time of the country 's economy was changed in the meeting room .
In 2001 AD Atalji changed the time of payment of economics in the contract and made it unearth in the morning .
Due to some rules of the synagogue it was possible to break the Tricolor at public places .
That is why most Indians got the opportunity to break their nationalism .
The great work of bringing our animal tricolor to the people is done by Atalji .
In this matter on some side people are demanding their mothers in the form of a protester .
They have seen that by reviving the composition of fulfilling dreams of prosperous and developed India I offer homage to all our guests .
We will surely enjoy knowing that the productivity of all the people in this country was 118 percent and the state was 74 percent .
This law goes well and keeps the sympathy of the groups of the suitable people more safe .
Or before the Katni of Madhya Pradesh here a court gave the fascinating education to the faults just five days .
Even in Rajasthan , in such a way in the courtyard there the decisions of women on the wrongdoing of women have been made fast .
This activity is going on to play an effective role in preventing the immorality of women and girls .
Besides social change economic progress is incomplete .
In this monsoon session of the Parliament all the members together have been given an ideal objectivity .
For this at the public level of all the specialists of the country , today I express myself with my heart .
My beloved countrymen , the attention of many Indians has been taken to the Asian sports competitions started in Jakarta .
Asian crises face , intent is also starting .
I want to enjoy all the players associated with medalism for the country .
The number of medal jinns for the country has increased , specially we have included in them , this gives a lot of positive signal .
Take care of your sensitivity because the healthy , healthy country itself will be able to build a prosperous and rich India .
Namasta spirituality , I respect my feelings .
Everybody is surprised to see the ' Rani Ki Bau ' built here in the eleventh century of Patan in Gujarat .
The land of India i . . engineering has to be called as a laboratory .
Many engineers of India are possible only in imagination , as far as possible , such things have been brought out .
We have found such a blood in our tradition to tell the heritage of great engineers .
This blood is India doctor .
M.
Vishwaswaraya.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the Kaveri river is still benefitting lakhs of farmers and people .
It is called ' Bhunga ' in Kutch .
My house has seen 3-3 earthquakes , experienced .
I have experienced three earthquakes in this house myself .
But go in and see , you will not see any harm at all .
This house is built according to the nature of our ancestors , geographical structure , along with the environment here .
After seeing the house it was thought in my mind , even before many ages the engineers had thought of the local situation in such a way that the people could stay safe , we should also practice it .
Now at the time when we celebrate ' Engineers Day ' we must also decide the future .
Working place should be taken at places .
In changing times what new things should you learn
What things should people learn
How to connect .
Nowadays the danger management has been done very big task .
The whole world has to face natural problems .
In such a situation how can we have a new form of structured mechanism
How to have its different practices .
What should the students learn in this
Many such things should be considered at the time when ' Engineers Day ' is celebrated .
My beloved countrymen , there is an environment of reproduction .
At the same time the preparation of Diwali is also going on .
In the mother-in-law of the mind we keep meeting and keep on talking to the mind .
At the same time we are working for our country from all over the mind .
Or with emotional feelings very much of all of us .
While in some parts the citizens are still waiting for Varunraj .
India is giant and diversity is also there in it , only in this country Varun kingdom sometimes shows its own favorite form .
In such a situation the most important responsibility comes on us , that is , we all should become the protector of nature , protector of nature .
If we also become nature then the balance of natural things will be resolved automatically .
We all saw this incident on the phone .
Actually it takes usually a few hours to return back after going to that cave .
Now it is not coming out , after remembering this , these children resorted to a little height in the middle of the cave .
But if they do not have anything for one or two days then the tabble started staying within 18 days .
We can now imagine how their moments , moments are lost in the mental condition when there is direct death in front .
On the other hand these girls were swinginging with two hands with trouble and on the other hand the entire worldwide humanity was expressing the human qualities of God .
Especially after seeing each 's extremely restraint behavior I feel that this is a learning quality , understanding and understanding .
Those whose children were irritated , their parents do not feel pain or neither does the mother feel ashamed of pain .
But keeping patience , restraint the peaceful behavior done by the whole society , this is a very important thing that we all have learned .
In the whole of this helpfulness a young man from the boat of Thailand had to lose his life .
In the extremely difficult situation filled with water and blindness , in the cave , with great patience , for helping patience , these jewels showed the entire world and also the newborns .
The time humanity gets accumulated by these sneezes such unique things occur at that time .
Only for this we need to concentrate on the calm and stable minds and for which we are working .
A few days ago poet Neeraj ji left us forever in our country .
Neeraj ji was one of the specialities.
He believed a lot in hope , faith , determination or along with it .
Every thing of Neeraj ji can prove to be very inspiring and powerful to all Indians .
If you see then these months of July and August are farming bonds and are very important for all young men .
Because during this time there is a problem of entry of colleges .
Millions of youths like Satyam come out of the ruins of life and enter the college .
The youth keeps on putting a step on a new path in life , in such a situation their focus comes out of question and comes out .
The attention of the student starts from home to the house .
Students come out of the shadow of their parents and come under the umbrella of the prophets .
My youth will be very excited about the beginning of the college life , be happy , I am very careful about it .
First of all you should stay out of the house , leave the village and go to the other side , getting out of a safe environment you will have to become yourself .
In order to give a different , new direction to many youths your life is going out leaving home first time .
I want to tell all of us so much , stay calm and enjoy this life .
It is only necessary to practice but the natural eagerness of finding out new things must be maintained among you as soon as possible .
Old friends are a special net .
In the middle of a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh , a student named Ashrama Chowdhury met with many problems in life and gained academic success , I was watching it .
The entrance test of MBBS situated for Asharam Jodhpur has been published in the first attempt .
So Divyaang Kanya Anushka Panda of Gurgaon is suffering from a hereditary disease of muscular atrophy navel from birth itself .
All of them have done such work keeping on watching the whole world on every difficulty occurring due to their determination and chicken pox .
If we look carefully then we will see many such examples .
In any part of the country , any good incident happening in the entire ear gives energy to my mind .
My beloved countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes fell on a battery, and it was written in it.
On reading the whole of the story we understood , how do our youth use smaarts and surgeons today and how do they try to bring about changes in the life of the normal person , it was a matter of fact .
The incident was such that the San Jos city of America was considered as a center of information . once I used to talk to Indian youth there .
At that time I encouraged them , consider how you can use intelligence , husky for your India , and make the issue a little more new .
The problem of brain-drain can get answers to brain-gene , so I used to take care of this .
In the two knowledge technology area of Rae Bareli , businessman , Yogesh Sahu Ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee Ji accepted my invitation and brought an innovative penance .
Yogas ji and Rajneesh ji together with using their professional council are a ' Samartgaon app ' made .
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world but through this app any information and information can be obtained on our mobile itself .
The residents of Taudakpur village through Rae Bareli , village chief - Sarpanch , district officer , chief district officer , all of these have made awareness among the people to use this app .
Exactly you say , the variety of Pandharpur means this is a unique journey .
Friends , this year Ashwadi was on 23 July Day , on this day Pandharpur festival is celebrated with devotion on a very huge amount .
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur districts of Maharashtra .
In the palanquin of the great saints like Santa Gyaneshwar and Santa Tukaram , while enjoying the name of the Thaun Vithal Nama , the Varakari walks towards Pandharpur singing with turbulence .
Vithal , which is also called Vithoba or Pandurang , reaches Pandharpur .
Vithal is a deity protecting the victims of poor , worries .
In the minds of people of Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana state there is immense faith and devotion towards Panduranga .
Go to the temple of Vithoba of Pandharpur and describe the glory , beauty here .
Then it should have been used through the medium of hypocrisy or impossible , in the literature of these saints an important message of goodwill , love and brotherhood has been given .
In protest against blindness the mantra of giving strength to fight society has been given by these saints .
And he has always been able to highlight the old evils from the society . the culture of compassion , equality and harmony on the minds of the people .
Lokmanya Tilak meaning the golden ocean of adventure and self-confidence .
The British tried to prove the royalty thrice in 200 years .
This is not a simple thing .
I want to tell the countrymen today a charming event about their effigies from Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad .
At that time more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad for their reception . In this meeting Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had got the opportunity to talk to Tilak .
In this meeting Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel , due to the personality of Lokmanya Tilak , was extremely impressed with ideas .
On 1 August , 1920 the daily Lokmanya Tilak was held , after that Patel decided , make Tilak memorial in Ahmedabad .
Akheri became the statue of Tilak and Sardar Saheb inaugurated this memorial by Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February , 1929 , not only from anyone else .
My beloved countrymen , one more thing tells , this effigy is also extremely specially rare .
Public Ganesh festival along with traditional faith and bhakti became an effective medium of social awareness , social activities , people making sense of harmony and equality .
Seeing this there was a need to fight against the British in that specific period .
And due to the festivals started by Tilaks they are brought to the society and by breaking the walls of the sects they will work together .
The popularity of organizing all these festivals has increased in Ogha of time , it is also kept in mind that there is a lot of attraction among the youth generations of today about their ancient tradition and the heroic heroes in history .
Today in many cities the pavilions of Ganesha festivals are seen standing in almost every street .
All the families in Galilee organise Ganapati festival together .
Here also our youth get good opportunity , their leadership , festival processor , program organizer , sympathetic quality can develop among them .
From the idol of Ganesha to the luggage of decoration some environment lovers must also be there .
Today every Indian needs to get good results of good governance and development .
I speak about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azhad will bring life to life , but he never bowed down to the foreign rule .
Chandrashekhar Azad village is Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh . I am very lucky that I got the opportunity to visit this village .
I got an opportunity to offer tribute to Chandrashekhar Azad Park of Allahabad . The desire to die by foreign pills was also not of Chandrashekhar Azad or Veer , to fight for freedom and to sacrifice even if you want to sacrifice then sacrifice only after getting freedom , as if these viranas had committed .
This was one of their specialities .
Once again I bow down to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azadji with devotion .
Recently in the fight of running 400 metres of Journey Enter - 200 World Athletics winners in Finland a new history has been created by jingling the gold medal of India 's magnificent wells and a geography .
Another unity of the country , Hina has sent me e-mail from Indonesia to the north of my patriot , now unity is preparing for the Asian Crida competition there .
It has been written in our e-mail that there is the most important moment in the life of any athlete , that is , when the player holds the tricolor in the hand , that moment .
' unity, we all feel respected to you.
We feel decent about you about the name of our country 's brightness .
World Para Athletics Grand Pricks in Tunisia has jinned unitless golden and copper medals in 2018 .
We should move ahead , keep playing , developing .
Many historical events have occurred in my favorite countrymen , August month and along with various festivals also come in this month but in monsoon season there is also the entry of disease in the house sometimes .
Once again I met in the mother of the mind .
Great blessings
Namaskar
My beloved countrymen , I have got the fate of condolences with us through this program ' Mon Ki Baat ' once again .
A few days back Cricket had a historical encounter in Bangalore .
You must be very soon in mind , I talk about the cricket settlement between India and Afghanistan .
In organisation both the Sanghs had seen very good sports .
A good work was done by Rashid Khan of Afghanistan this year in IPAL .
I will provide an expression to our craftsmen to show their culture , about this I consider my Indian friends as a gift .
Whatever is best , best in Afghanistan , the same resistance proves .
We have come to experience what kind of sports activity is , what kind of sports activity is .
Sports is a very good medium for exciting society and showing faculty , revenge among our youth .
I am very interested in both the organizations of India and Afghanistan .
Even then I hope that we keep playing and developing with each other while performing sports like this .
Oh my dear countrymen , or on 21st June Rosie i . . the fourth yoga day was seen in a different way .
The European Parliament , the United Nations , New York Palace headquarters , or Japanese warship ship , were seen doing public yoga all around .
First time in Saudi Arabia there was a yogic historical program and I came to know that at this time only women did the work of guidance for many asanas .
In Ladakh on the high peaks of the snowy mountains the soldiers of India and China have done yoga together .
By breaking the bondage of the borders we are working together .
Thousands of enthusiastic people in hundreds of countries have taken a huge festival of Yoga Day by going across caste , religion , region , color or linga such distinctions .
If people from all over the world were participating in the programs of ' Yoga Day ' then in such a situation there is no chance of its casket enthusiasm in India .
Yoga has been done at three places like Jawan , Padan , Naval , Hawaii Dal of the security forces of our country .
Some brave soldiers performed yogasana on the panbudi .
While some soldiers sacrificed yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen .
The warriors of our air force , warriors , and everyone surprisingly doing yogasana in the sky at a height of 15 thousand feet from the earth .
The special thing to say in this is that they did not do yoga while sitting in the plane , otherwise they did yoga in the air .
Whether there is school , college , office , park , high building or creed ground , all the yoga was done .
While crossing the path , path and geographical border the work of accomplishing people all over the world is done by yoga practice , we have been living in mind this spirit of ' Vasudhaiva kutumbhakam ' since ancient times .
Our sage , Muni , Sat are always filled with this idea .
Today ' yoga ' has been shown by means of correcting it .
Today ' Wellness ' is doing this idea of revolutionary work , but I feel like .
We see mother in the form of god , mother gives birth to us therefore we consider her as god , this is our culture .
Sometimes doctors give us regeneration .
The role of the doctor is not limited only in the medical treatment .
They do not have medical knowledge to the doctors -LRB- The Not Only uar Olso Hill -RRB- , along with what kind of lifestyle they should have , what style of their lifestyle increases and what kind of adverse effect is there on their health , there is a good , very good experience about it .
Indian doctors have made their own unique , independent identity in the whole world by philosophy of their innumerable potential and culture .
Through ' Mon Ki Baat ' I wish all our doctors cooperative boards a lot of love for ' Docters Day ' on 1 July .
India has a rich history .
The Kabirwad of Gujarat is a good choice for us when I was in Gujarat , at that time the traditional people of Sat Kabir used to get a big national association .
In the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh the tomb of this village of Magahar was taken by Santa Kabirdas , all of which are underneath .
But Kabirdas ji chose the other place of Magahar to take a tomb , is it fond of us
At that time it was believed that whose death was done here , he could not get a place in heaven .
And in contrast those who commit suicide in Kashi go to heaven .
Magahar was considered an unforgettable place but Santa Kabirdas had no faith in such things .
Santa Kabirdas ji filled social equality , calmness and harmony through Sakhya and both .
This was their ideal .
We see this ideal from their structures .
The meaning of this is that which understands the pain of others is true fakir , saturated .
And those who do not know the pain of others , they are ineffective .
Kabirdasji had given special attention to social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time .
Knowledge related to people should be considered as base . Praise them .
Even after losing so long the things told by Kabir are as effective as this .
If we read the things of Kabirji today , then it seems that it is telling us the things of today 's knowledge age .
We feel that their thoughts are decorated even today .
Now we are talking about Santa Kabirdas ji , in such a situation I remember one of their two things , in which he says , Guru Govind Dou Stand , Kake can apply
There is such a great guru , Jagatguru - Guru Nanakdev .
He showed many people the way , from many generations he has been inspiring .
Guru Nanakdev has to say that the service of poor and needy is to be done by the means of service of God .
Wherever he went , where he worked for the good of the society .
He brought the arrangement of social distinction free radicals . such kitchens can eat food by coming to any caste , religion , sect . Guru Nanakdev has started the method of linger ' .
In 219 AD Guru Nanak Devji is being celebrated in the 550th light festival .
The horrific settings of the Jallianwala Bagh here are going to be completed 1000 years in 20019 , this incident was going to be a black spot for the entire humanity .
The victory of peace and non-violence , sacrifice and sacrifice always occurs .
Shyamaprasad Mukhraji is a pleasure and in this program I am Dr . .
In 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyamprasad Mukharji Yanch used to be a very big contribution .
For the development of West Bengal it becomes extremely excited and dedicated .
Well, then, we're all right, Dr.
In the last few weeks I got the opportunity to convince the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video column .
On crossing the files they got the opportunity to know about the changes coming in the life of people , it can be said .
Through the medium of young women ' Common Service Centre ' in Durgam - Atdurgam Ganwa they provide services till the definition of elderly people in villages .
I used to do business of making its ice cream by collecting a bugyal of cigarettes in Chhattisgarh .
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand lakhs of youths in the country along with running the district headquarters are providing medicines at cheap rates by going to nearby villages and villages .
In this program more than the success of the government , more than the success of the common man comes out , for this reason I get more enjoyment , the success of the common man is the true power of this country .
In such disappointing environment he gives us information about the hopes , new enthusiasm and incidents happening in the life of the common man , in such a situation he can not be given credit to the government .
The incident of small girls in a small village of remote areas also proves to be inspiration to hundreds of crore countrymen .
With the help of technologist for me , making a translation with beneficiaries through video bridge , one moment spent in their meeting has also proved to be very pleasant , extremely inspiring .
To give life to poor people new happiness , new enthusiasm , new inspiration is achieved in one way .
I am very beloved of the countrymen .
40-40 , 50-50 lakh people participated in the program of this video bridge and they did the job of giving me a new sacrifice .
For this I want to express my respect to everyone again .
On the other hand there are business and technicians while on the other hand our fielders working in the field are brothers and sisters .
Now we also think that , farming and technology are both different businesses . What is their relation
The plans started to be prepared and their successful efforts started to increase the production of farming damsels .
On the other hand from the production of pickle to its market a credibility has been made , in which the role of making a farmer is important , while on the other hand there is also an attempt to ensure partnership of the farming class .
My friends
This work done in youth is actually inspiring newborns .
Van Nation , One Tex ' is the dream of the people of the country .
If you have to give the most credit to bring improvement of forest text then I will give it to the states .
GST Cooperative Federalism ' is a very good example in which all the states decided for nationwide together and after that tax reforms can be achieved at such a broad level in the country .
Till now 27 batches of the GST council have been formed and people with different state ideas come together on this battery .
Before GST there were various types of 17 tax systems in the country but now in the new system the system has been implemented in the entire country .
GST is the victory of authenticity and that is also a festival of authenticity .
Or many times before there were complaints about ' inspector rule ' in tax processes .
GST, maybe, the world's largest tax improvement.
Generally in such a large quantity , in order to improve such a huge public interest and to maintain the entire plan in the form of complete sustainability the period of 5 to 7 years is applicable .
At Namskar Ali only 21st national cricket competitions were organised in Australia from 4th April to 15th April .
Excitement , excitement , hope , aspiration , accomplishment of showing something - when such an environment is there then someone can stay incomplete with it .
This was such a time when people from all over the country had to think , which player is going to play today .
Whatever is the work of India , how many medals we can live and all this is also very natural .
Our sportsmen also performed a good job while fulfiling the comparison of the people of the country and jinned a medal in a lesson .
Then whether it is naming , dog , hypothesis , table tennis or badminton India has done the best work .
26 golden , 20 silver , 200 bronze - India has earned total 66 medals .
Because of this success every Indian feels respected .
Medal singing is a matter of respect and joy for every player .
For all the countries , this is an extremely respectable moment for all the countrymen .
Perhaps my words will decrease to express that feeling .
But I want to hear what I have heard from these players .
For special reasons at this time there were many such things which had happened first time .
Among all the competitions which Manika son participated , the medal zincle .
That is the first Indian woman player who has given India the first gold medal in personal table tennis competition .
India got the most medal naming .
On the 15-year-old Indian nambas Anish Bhan, it was the youngest player to jinn the Golden Medal in the national competition.
Sachin Chaudhari , which simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simplified medal , is the only Indian para power lifter .
The creed competition of these days was also special because most of the medal winners were players of this woman .
Whether it is squash , boxing , weightlifting , namabaji - women players performed good workmen .
Everything was interested in this fight , both the medals were available to India - everyone saw this face .
The players participating in the competitions had come from different parts of the country , from small towns .
There is also a contribution of their friends who have raised their minds in every situation .
In the last month ' Mon Ki Baat ' I had invited the countrymen especially my youth to Fit India and I had invited everyone .
Participate in Fit India , repudiate Fit India .
And I am very happy that people are joining it with great enthusiasm .
Many people have shown their text by writing the utensils , the utensils are sent , the mantra of their health on Soshal midwives - Fit India stories have been sewed .
A housing Shashikanth Bhosle has written his picture in the waterfall - my weepon is my body, my agemnt is waiting, my old is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written : Because of the morning walk I feel happy and healthy .
And he further says - for me--fitness comes with a little and we should little, when we are helpy.
There is no doubt that Devnathji is healthy in happiness .
Dhawal Prajapati has written while shooting his photograph of the mountaineering that ' Travel and Mountaineering for me ' is the same fit India ' .
I feel very good to see many famous people encouraging their youth in extremely attractive way for Fit India .
Film actor Akshay Kumar has made a video sheer on Twitter .
Other youngsters have left their experiences while joining Fit India .
I feel that such swimming is extremely beneficial for all our country .
I would definitely say one more thing - without spending any money the name of Fit India Challu is Yoga .
The importance of ' International Yoga Day ' on 21st June is now enjoyed by the whole world .
You will also bring ready from now on .
Not alone - your city , your village , your department , your school , your college , every person should try to participate in the yoga of any age , whether man or woman .
Today I want to talk to you to invite you to do a new task and I have seen that many youths are learning something new at this time .
My young friends, I despise you to join a special internship.
The three ministries of the Government of India , human development , the Department of Drinking Water - three - four ministries of the Government have started the Summer Internship of India 20018 program together .
Students and students of the college , youth of NCC , youth of NSS , youth of Nehru youth center , who want to be included in the society , want to become free .
With a positive energy we decide to do something in society , there is a chance for all of them and this will also get strength from cleanliness and when we celebrate the 150th Jayanti of Mahatma Gandhi from 2 October , we will get our joy of doing something before that and I also tell you that those who have been the best administrators who have done the best work in the college , have done this in the students - all these will be given national awards .
Not only this , the trainee who fulfils this is also given two credit points to the UGC .
I invite students , students and youths to take advantage of this internship once again .
You can register for India Summer Internship on My Govt .
I hope our youth will definitely make successful this movement of cleanliness .
Use a new experience or a chance of holidays .
This group of youths has started a big campaign for the education of children living on roads and roads .
Initially on the road the situation of the children who are asking for fools or small and big tasks left them so much that they bowed themselves completely in this work .
This Mohim , which started from 15 children of the hut box near Gita Kalni in Delhi , has now reached 22 thousand children of the capital .
The youth , teachers associated with this mission have joined this virtuous attempt to make social changes by removing two hours from their busy daily routine .
In the same way some farmers of the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become inspiration for the farmers of the country .
In combined efforts they have changed their fate not only in their own , but also in their area .
Bageshwar of Uttarakhand is mainly taken from Mandwa , Chaulai , Maka or potatoes .
They started making biscuits from this pickle of the field and they started selling biscuits .
These farmers have established a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have opened the factory for making biscuits there .
Recognizing the patience of the farmers the administration has also associated it with the National Livelihood campaign .
These biscuits are now being distributed not only in the approximately fifty anganwadi center of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani .
Due to hard work of the farmers the annual income of the institute has not only reached 10 to 15 lakh rupees , but due to getting the opportunity of employment more than 900 families the migration from the district has also decreased .
My dear countrymen , when we hear that in the future there will be war for water in the world .
Everyone speaks this thing but does not he have any responsibility
Does not you think that water supply is a social responsibility
Every person should be responsible .
For centuries its ancestors have shown it .
He has given priority to every drop of water .
They have discovered new methods for how to save every drop of water .
Among you those who have got the opportunity to go to Tamilnadu may have been the first that in some temples of Tamilnadu , irrigation system , water supply system , bad time arrangement etc . large scriptures have been written in the temples .
Manarkovil , Chiran Mahadevi , Kovalpatty or Pudukottai , you will get to see the biggest inscriptions everywhere .
Even today , various varieties are popular as tourist spots but we will not forget that these are also alive proofs of the water supply campaign of our ancestors .
The queen of Adlaj and Patan in Gujarat is the world heritage of UNESCO , its grandeur is worth seeing .
Vihiri is the same way water temple .
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely go to see the moon shore in Jodhpur .
This is India 's largest and well known whirlwind and the most important thing is that the area where there is lack of water .
April , May , June , July is the best time for the accumulation of rain water and if we prepare before then you will get much benefit .
In the work of this water conservation the funds of MNREGA are also used .
In the last three years everybody has tried in their own way towards water conservation and climate management .
Besides the funds of Manreg every year Sarasari 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management .
If you have to speak about 2017-18 , 55  of the total expenditure of 64 thousand crores i . . about 35 thousand crore rupees have been spent for the work of water resources .
In the last three years due to such water conservation and climate conservation measures about 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted .
Under MNREGA district administration has taken responsibility of land and water supply in large quantity .
With the help of people from around 40 to 45 villages Sasur Khadri has revived these dried rivers .
Whether animals , birds , fields , fields , villages , this is a big success .
I say that once again in April , May , June , July we are in front of us , we should also take some precautions for water conservation , water supply , we should also make some plans , we will also show something .
When there is a word of mind then me message comes all around , utensils come , phone comes .
In the north 24 Parganas district of West Bengal , Ian Kumar Benjee of Devitola village has written on My Govt that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many do not know the element of living in the peace , beautiful and positive way of the Nobel Register Ravindranath Tagore .
Please discuss this matter in the ' Man Ki Baat ' program that people will get information about this .
I consider Ionji 's honor that he attracted the attention of all the partners of the ' Mon Ki Baat ' towards it .
Gurudev Tagore was a personality full of knowledge and wisdom , whose authority has raised a stick on everyone .
Rabindranath was a genius , multi-purpose person , but among them was a teacher at every moment .
The language was not coming up early in the morning , I had the habit of listening to Rabindra music on the radio and when I got an opportunity to listen to this poem , Anandloke and Aguner , Poroshmani .
You must have also shown Ravindra music , his poems .
I offer respect to Ravindranath Thakur .
In some days the holy month of Ramadan starts .
Ramadan month is celebrated all over the world with faith and respect .
The collective purpose of daily is this that when a person is suffocated automatically then he also feels the hungryness of others .
When he feels himself thirsty then he feels the thirst of others .
This is an opportunity of learning and keeping in mind the messages of Prophet Mohammad .
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and harmony like them .
Once a person asked the apostles - what work is good in Islam
Prophet Saheb said , giving food to the poor and the needy and considering each other , whether you know them or not .
The knowledge and deeds of the sent Mohammad would have been believed .
They have no ego of anything .
He told us that ego lays knowledge only .
The faith of the sent Mohammad was that no person is due to this property but because of his holy soul .
Buddha Poornima is a special day for every Indian .
We should feel that India is the land of Lord Buddha who shows the strength of doing this , service and sacrifice , which has guided lakhs of people around the world .
This Buddha Purnima reminds of the responsibility of following Lord Buddha by trying to walk on the path shown by him .
Lord Buddha is the motivation power of equality , peace , unity and brotherhood .
These are such human problems which are the most important in today 's world .
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar insisted that Lord Buddha has a very big inspiration in his social element .
Babasaheb may be confined , afflicted , absorbed , wandered , enabled millions of people .
There is no big example of doing this .
To understand the sorrows of the people Karna is one of the great qualities of Lord Buddha .
It is said that Buddhist monks traveled in different countries , they used to take the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha along with them and this happens always .
In the entire Asia there is a description of the teaching of Lord Buddha .
In many Asian countries like China , Japan , Korea , Thailand , Kambodia , Myanmar many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist learning are roaming in the open and due to this reason we are developing basic facilities for Buddhist tourism , due to which the important Buddhist places of south - east Asia are connected to the important Buddhist places of India .
I am very happy that the Government of India is partner in the work of reviving many Buddhist temples , in which the beautiful Anand Temple of the garden of Myanmar of hundreds of years ago is also included .
Today , everywhere in the world one gets to see sympathy and human suffering , the learning of Lord Buddha shows the way to finish the penance .
I enjoy the luxurious beauty of Buddha Purnima to all those who believe in the principles of worshiping Lord Buddha in the world .
For the whole world we ask the blessings of Lord Buddha so that we can fulfill our sympathy for the creation of a peaceful and pathetic world based on their learning .
Today when we remember Lord Buddha . You must have heard about the idols of Lafing Buddha , it is believed that Lafing Buddha brings good luck , but only a few people believe that Smayling Buddha is also associated with an important moment of the protection history of India .
Now you think what is the relation between smoking Buddha and India 's military power .
Then the day would be Buddha Purnima .
On 11th May , 1998 the Pokhran of Rajasthan was tested .
That hour is completed 20 years and with the blessings of Lord Buddha this test was done on Buddha Purnima .
The test of India was successful and in this way India showed its strength in science and technology .
We can say that that day has been marked in the history of India as its strength .
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that internal power is necessary for peace .
Similarly when we are strong in the form of a country then we ask each other peacefully .
This month in May 1998 therefore this month is not only important for the country but the way this test has been done is important .
This destination showed to the whole world that India 's land is the land of great scientists and with the leadership of architect India can achieve new heights .
Atal Bihari Bajpayeeji had given this mantra to Jai-Jawan Jai-kisan , Jai-vigyan .
We are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the day of 1998 , then for the strength of India Atlaji gave us the mantra of biology , making it self-sufficient for the creation of modern India , for the creation of powerful India , for the creation of powerful India .
Make your strength part in the power of India .
A new joy of taking the journey which was started by Atalji , we can also get a new solution .
My beloved countrymen , meet in the next ' Men Ki Baat ' program and communicate more .
Very blessings
Man's Baat March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavami .
A few days back on 26 January when all the chiefs of the ASEAN country had come here then along with them the art gallery of that country had also come here .
And it is a matter of great pride , most of the countrysides in them sympathetic to us Ramayana .
That is , Ram and Ramayana are not only effective and inspirational in India but also in Asian states on this world .
I wish you all once again the beauty of Ramnavami .
Like my beloved countrymen , I have also got a lot of addresses , emails , phone calls and reactions of all of you at this time .
I will read what Komal Thakkar has written about starting the online class of Sanskrit on ' May - Gov ' .
Mr . Dhanshyam Kumarji of Barkar village of Nalanda district of Bihar read the reaction written on Narendra Modi app .
The concern that you have expressed on the surface of the ground is definitely very important .
The Shriyut Shakal Scientist of Karnataka has written that ' Ayushman Bharat ' is possible only when Ayushman land is there .
Shri Yogesh Bhadrashyji says that at this time I should speak about the health of the youth .

The gratitude that they have given behind the book ' Akzam Warrior ' from Chennai to Angha , Jayash and many other children have come to know by writing what they have come in their minds .
Angha , jayesh and all other children , I want to tell you all that my tiredness goes away all day by your leaves .
So far , so many phone calls , reactions , all that I can get to read , which can be heard , many things have come to my mind .
Today if I decide to tell the same thing then I have to say that continuously for months or months .
This time most of the parrots have been sent by children , they have written about tests .
Your plains have told me in the holidays .
In summers animals and birds do not get water , they have been worried about it .
The fielding brothers and sisters have sent serpents about the things that are happening in the country of farming fairs and fields .
Some awakening citizens have suggested solutions regarding water supply .
Since then since we have started this monkey through radio , since then I feel a way , most of the utensils come to the topics related to summers .
Prior to the examination , letters related to the care of the examination of the student come .
That is , the things of mind change according to the weather and maybe it is true that this thing in our mind changes the weather in some other life and does not change .
When I get to read in your grandson how the defender of Karimganj here of Assam Ahmad Ali has made nine schools for poor children on the strength of his desire - then I would see the incomplete desire of our country in it .
When I got to hear the words of Dr . Mohan Chaudhari of Kaanpur , they go to the pavement and give food to the poor and also treat free medicine - then from that thing I get an opportunity to feel bondage in the country .
Many travellers traveling from their cab helped a lot .
A engineer girl gave her first full pay .

My beloved countrymen , for the next few months , our agricultural brothers are very important for the bugyals .
From Mahatma Gandhi to Scientific , whether it is irony , whether it is the fourth Charansingji or the fourth Goddess Lalji , all the same fields and fielders both consider the meaning system of the country and the incomparable factor of the normal life .
At the same time Lal Bahadur Shastri used to fulfil trees , plants and vegetation and excellent agricultural structure .
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhari Charan Singh had instructed the fielders to use new mechanisms, to use new amendments, and fill the requirements.
This state with a very low area has done a lot of work .
During the year 2015-16 of its producer of Meghalaya in comparison to the last five years .
When the aim is fixed , there is strong complication , there is the desire to size it , then it can be fulfilled , it has been proved by their experience .
In comparison to brothers and sisters , in order to get the right price for the fields of the fields , an important decision has been taken .
It has been decided that the disposal of the poor will be given a maximum of one and a half times the cost of their production .
As far as it is said , the production expenses which will be remembered for humiliation , in which the work on the fields , their wealth and expenditure , their wealth , tools , equipments or animals , the price of all kinds of treasures , the price of all kinds of treasures given to the state government , the price of buffaloes , the trade given to the state government , the fare and not only the fare of it , but the farmer does his own career , or if someone in his family works in the field , then the origin of his work will also be added to the production expenses .
Besides this , the work of improving the agricultural market in the country is also going on widely .
Attempts are being made to gather local mandis , grocery markets and then global markets in the village .
The farmers do not have to go far away to sell their goods , they are being made very modern by providing them the necessary facilities to the 22 thousand rural markets in the country and then they are being connected to the agricultural produce market unity and e-name platform .
That is , arrangement of connecting agriculture with any market in the country is being made .
My beloved Deshbandhano , this year the festival of Mahatma Gandhi starts in one and a half hundred years .
How did the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is our composition , apart from that , how can we come together to Gandhiji ' s best faith
Gandhi 150 "What is the Logo of the composition
We all come together to bring the fathers a memorable concentration and by remembering the fathers , inspiring them , to reach our country at a new height .
Today the country has gone ahead of traditional point of view in the field of health .
The responsibility of doing all the work related to health in the country was considered to be of the Ministry of Health only .
Only now all the ministries and departments , whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness , whether it is the Ministry of Chemicals and Metals , the Ministry of Chemicals or the Ministry of Women and Children or the State Governments , all the departments are working together for healthy India .
The preventive care of health is the cheapest and easy solution .
Therefore in order to take care of health the more benefits we will get to the person , family and society .
Besides this work is being started in a wide range towards establishing health facilities centres throughout the country .
Yoga practice has made its new identity worldwide in order to maintain resistance health .
The body stays healthy and strong by yoga .
Because of the bitterness of all our Yoga Yoga Yoga has become a public school today , has been placed in the house .
The international yoga day of this year - i . . on 21st June and 100th day Shillak is there .
In the last three years , in the program of every international yoga day people participated in every country and everywhere in the world with great enthusiasm .
This year also we decided to do yoga and inspire our entire family , friendly family and others to do yoga .
We have to do the job of making it more popular by reaching new , attractive methods to young and eldest citizens and every group of women and men .
Although yoga programs are being organised throughout the year through telephone and electronic media .
But from today to yogadivasa some programs of making awareness about yoga can be done as a campaign
My beloved countrymen , I am not yoga teacher , yes , only yoga exercise is definitely .
Only some people have made me yogic by using their imagination and some third animated videos of doing my yoga have been made .
I can practice this video transplant i . . asana and pranayama together .
Today more than 3 thousand public health centers have been opened in the country where more than 800 medicines are available at a very high rate .
The work of starting more new centres is also going on .
I am convinced of the sources of ' Mon Ki Baat ' that they should definitely reach the information of these medicinal centres to the people i . . the expenses of their medicines will be very less , they will have a very big service .
The price of stents needed for heart patients has been reduced to 85 percent .
By controlling the price of equipments brought for knee surgery reducing up to 50 to 70 percent .

To get rid of tuberculosis one has to try all of us together .
My beloved Deshbandhano , on 14th April Dr . Babasaheb Ambadkar 's pleasure is there .
Many years ago Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country .
Because of industries poor people can also be provided employment , they die .
Today ' India ' campaign is being successfully started in the country .
In such a situation Dr . Ambedkar has inspired us the dream of becoming an industrial superpower of India .
India has now come into the form of a glittering star in the economy of the world , the world 's most direct foreign investment is happening today in India .
The whole world is looking towards India as a center of communication , amendment and development .
In order to provide facilities like good roads , water supply , health facilities , education , digital connectivity in the big cities and small towns of the country today , the Smart City campaign and urban campaign have been started .
Babasaheb had a firm faith in his own purity .
Nobody has considered him to take care of life in the prince itself .
At the same time , by giving some tired convenience to the poor their dignity would not be removed by giving some help .
Today youth researchers and youth workers are making a program like ' Mudra Yojana ' , ' Start Up India ' , ' Stand up India ' .
He had seen water energies in the form of national power .
In the development of the country by identifying the importance of waterways it would have been filled up . Several river slopes , installation of different applications related to water was a distance of Babasaheb .
Today historical efforts are being made to develop waterways and monkeys in the country .
The monkeys are developing on different sea shores of India and basic facilities are being strengthened between old monkeys .
In the decade of forty the main problem of the church was to be , second is warrior , cold and fast .
At that time , Dr . Ambedkar got the foundation of  Tim India ' in a way .
He discussed the importance of union kingdom and for the development of the country the central and state came together and filled it with work .
Today we have taken the mantra of cooperative union system in every department of governance , along with that also , competitive cooperative union system .
And the most important thing is that Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar is the inspiration of crores of backward classes like me .
To go ahead in life there is no need to be born in a respected family , otherwise in India there can be big dreams born in poor families , they can try to fulfil it and they can also be successful in it .
Many people treated Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
This is India which is of Ambedkar , is of the poor , of the backward class people .
During this period from 14th April to 5th century the consciousness of Dr . Ambedkar ' village - state campaign ' is going to be organised .
There will be different programs on rural development , poor welfare and social justice throughout the country .
Include in maximum numbers in this program , this is the destination of my leadership to all of us .
Many times like Lord Mahavir Jayanti , Hanuman Jayanti , Easter , Baisakhi are coming in my favorite country .
Lord Mahavir Jayanti is the day of learning from his sacrifices and postures .
The life and learning of Lord Mahavir who instructs non-violence is inspiring for all of us .
The curiosity of Mahavir Jayanti to all the natives .
Easter said that Lord reminds of the inspirational teachings of Jesus , he gave the message of peace , prosperity , justice , patience and compassion to the human people .
In April the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India .
Many blessings
First of all we see the color of the sea blue only in everyday life we feel that water is colorless , it does not have color .
Be the river , be the sea , the water in it looks colorful , we have ever considered it .
This question came in the mind of a young man in the decade of 1920 .
With this question a great scientist of modern India came out .
He was honored with Nobel Perscars for the best work on light skating .
Its research is famous by the name of Raman Effect .
On 28th February , Raman was considered to have researched light skating therefore we celebrate 28th February every year as National Science Day or they got noble awards for research .
This country has given many great scientists in the field of science .
On the other hand the tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan , Bhaskar , Brahmaputra and Aryabhatta remained on the other hand in health therapy Sushrut and Charak are the places of their glory .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and every Govind Khuran are the pride of India .
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose the famous Boson particle has also been given the name .
Suddenly I got the opportunity to participate in a program of artificial intelligence institute in Mumbai .
It is very interesting to know about the miracles of science .
Through artificial intelligence helps in making robo , and special work machines .
Nowadays instruments are smacking their intelligence more from their own studies .
The use of this technique can be done for the drying up of the life of poor , ventilated and needy .
In this program of artificial intelligence how can I use artificial intelligence to make the life of Divyaang brothers and sisters dry
Can we estimate natural risks through artificial intelligence
A few days back in the capital of the Istrael Gujarat there was a chance to go to the inauguration of income crew in Ahmedabad .
There a young man had developed such a digital tool that he could not speak , such a silent person wrote that his voice gets transformed and we can also translate with this person as we talk to someone .
In many such places we can use artificial intelligence as well .
The machine works as per your wishes .
Only what we want to do with the machine depends on ourselves .
Here human goals prove to be important . use of science for human welfare , use of science for the highest height of human life .
Thomas alva administering the discovery of the divine of the wine has been unsuccessful in many of its uses .
When we asked him about this then he told me that I have discovered ten thousand methods of how not to make the window goddess i . . Adison made his own strength to his ineffective .
Today I am the acting place of Maharshi Aurobindo with Yoga .
As a revolutionary he called the British regime , fought against them , asked for their regime .
As a great sage he presented questions in every aspect of life .
Recognizing its answer showed the way to humanity .
In order to know the truth repeatedly the feeling of questioning is important .
Behind scientific research this is also a raw inspiration .
Does , how and how the answers of these questions do not come up till then you should not stay healthy .
I enjoy all the things connected with our scientific , scientific sector with national science .
Inspire our youth to serve society with the help of science , for this many luxuries of me are inspired .
Many messages come to me about friends , paintings , time of crisis , safety , danger , people write something or the other .
From Pune Ravindra Singh has written about professional safety in his opposite on the Narendra Modi Mobile Pass .
He writes that the quality of safety in the factory and construction of our country is not as good .
On March 4 this is the national security day of India , with the point of view that the Pentagon should take the subject of safety in this program of our mind , so that awareness of safety increases in the people .
We are talking about public safety at that time two things are important , readiness and preparation .
Safety is of two types one which is essential at the time of danger and the other is essential in daily life that is safe .
We stay aware of safety in daily life otherwise it becomes difficult to get protection during danger .
If we stay alert , follow the necessary rules then along with protecting our lives we can also save our society from great accidents .
We see that many babes are written about the safety of the place of work only does not seem to be following .
On which there are non-eastern trains like municipal corporations , municipal corporations , once in a week or a month , go to different schools and make a mock drill before the students .
It has two advantages , the East India team will also have the habit of staying alert and the new generation will also get education in this regard and there is no need to spend differently for it , in a way it becomes a part of education and for this I am always a leader .
If we talk about danger and crisis then India is geographically disintegrated .
Some natural , man-made , risk and chemical and industrial accidents have occurred by this country .
NDMA i . . National Handicapped Management Authority gives attention to the consumption of country .
NDMA runs fast in dangers like earthquake , pur , potato , landslide .
Training and awareness have an important role .
Two-three years ago thousands of people had to lose their lives every year in the lap of heat , after that NDMA took the campaign to live in this context , organised workforce .
By this it is considered that if we give priority to safety then we can get protection .
Agricultural service , National Anti-Terrorism Redressal Team , administered team , administered by the armed forces do not serve their lives in the time of crisis , helps the people .
NCC and scout also help in this work , give training .
Bimstek , Bangladesh , India , Myanmar , Sri Lanka , Bhutan , Nepal , together with the consumption system was also done , this was the first and extensive attempt .
This child should become an individual part of his life .
Build my favorite country , under this time under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in the economy of this time , the village has been filled with the construction of energy from the slopes and slopes through the medium of bioches .
Because of this the program has been started and it has been given the name of Gobar Dhan . Galvinayazing organic bio agro resort .
In some European countries and China energy is produced from semen and biologically fertilizer part only it is not used in India with complete capacity .
Under Swachh Bharat Mission village we are visiting this direction .
The goal of making use of animals , garbage living in the fields , kitchen in the kitchen is to make use of all these energy based on the base of the base of the bay .
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana , the farmers of rural India will be encouraged to encourage the brothers and sisters that they should not see the shore and the shore as a dress but see it as a source of production .
The rural areas will get many benefits from the Gobar Dhan Yojana .
Production of cropping and vegetarians will be helpful .
The chances of employment will increase by collecting garbage , its transportation , sale of biogas .
A online bench will be built for the good management of the Gobar Dhan Yojana by which the farmers will be connected to the customer and they will get a worthy price for the sugarcane and agricultural driven goods .
I observe the workers especially the folk living in rural India that we take the precautions , making cooperative units , making cooperative units , or taking advantage of the opportunity .
I invite you to become a partner of this flame of clean energy and green employment , to transform the wealth of our village into the wealth of the solder and to transform it into the wealth of the calf .
Very different art works have been prepared by using garbage .
Work school has been organised to train people in all the ways of waste management .
Everybody pursued the poem in cleansing poetry.
There was an exciting environment for cleansing .
Specially Shaliya students participated in the chastisement .
I enjoy the people of Raipur Mahanagar Palace , Chhattisgarh , the government and administration here in the same manner as the innovation of this festival was done in the manner of garbage management and cleanliness .
Every year on March 8 this day is celebrated in the form of International Women 's Day .
Many programs are organised in the country and in the world .
Women working in different areas are honored this day .
Today the country is moving towards the development of women under the leadership by going ahead of women development .
This moment he reminds me of Swami Vivekananda , he had said , ideal women imagination meaning complete freedom .
The idea of Swamiji , a hundred years ago , expresses the contemplation of women 's power in Indian culture .
Today in social , economic life it is the duty of all of us to ensure equal partnership to women in every area , responsibility of all ours .
We are part of such tradition where men are identified by women . Yashoda son , Kaushalya son , son of Gandhari son of the child is such an identity .
Women are weak , strong , equal partners in the development of the country , this is the dream of new India .
In the past few days a person had suggested me a good thing that on March 8 many programs are held on the woman 's day .
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representative, 10 thousand women cleaning 50 thousand Raj Egypt.
We can imagine this is such a big event .
Women of Jharkhand have shown that women 's power , clean India is such a power of the activity which will convert the culture of cleanliness in normal life into the nature of the masses .
Brothers and sisters , two days before I reached Vege after 70 years of independence in three villages on Alifunta Island of Batami first , after that there was joy in the public there .
We know that this island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai .
In 70 years of Eliphant in three villages Rajbandar , Morbandar , Settle monkeys had spread blindness in the lives of the people here , now their life has glittered .
I enjoy the administration and people there .
I am happy that Eliphanta village and cave are now roaming out .
This is not just a new beginning but also a new beginning .
Get out of the life of the countrymen , what can be the matter of joy more than pleasure in their life .
My beloved brother Bhaginino , now we celebrated the festival of Mahashivratri .
This month is the speciality of the month of March , the charming beauty of adventurous birds , amra manjari .
We love this month for the counting of Holi .
On 2 March Holi will be celebrated with enthusiasm throughout the country .
Holi has the importance of color as well as Holika Dahna also has importance this is the day of burning of bad habits .
This mountain should be pleasant in the life of our countrymen , or luxurious .
Build my favorite country a lot of blessings, Namaskar
Manki Baat, January 2018
In this year of 2018 through the medium of ' Mon Ki Baat ' it is the first time to convince us .
Two days ago we celebrated Prajasatak Din with great enthusiasm .
This program was attended by the chief honorable guests of ten countries , in the history the first time of the youth .
My dear countrymen , I am referring to the utensils of light Tripathi today .
Today women are progressing fast in every area in India , going forward and seeing the value of the country high , it is very happy .
Since ancient times the honor given to women in our country , their place of social and their contribution , this is a big , new thing from the point of view of the whole world .
There is a big tradition of great distresses in India .
There is an important contribution of many indulgents in India in the creation of widows .
Lopamudra , Gargi , Maitreyi do not know that many names can be taken .
This woman strength keeps the entire country , entire society tied her family in the threshold of unity .
Whether the great scholars like Vedic times like Lopamudra , Gargi , Maitreyi , the great knowledge of Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai , or whether the administration of Ahilyabai Holkar like the power or the poet Ranaragini , the woman ' s power is often inspiring us .
Prakash Tripathi has mentioned many examples in his utensil .
He has written that his religious conservation minister Nirmala Sitharaman seemed to be inspiring him to travel through the battlefield aircraft .
Emotional warriors , Mohna Singh and Avni Chaturvedi have become humid , they are now training in ' Sukoi-30 ' .
A few days back reliable patriots started a new thing .
Those women who have got some cases in their area very fast , such a unusual work done by the patriotism of a group of women who have gathered together .
Our women 's power has established a new record only after breaking the range of traditionalism of society .
He told us , hard work , tireless efforts and if the composition is firm then any crisis came , any obstacle has been created , then crossing them , making a new way through the side .
Now this path is inspired not only by our contemporary people but also for many generations .
This book is available in the form of ' Nrandra Modi Web site ' .
Today in positive changes happening in the country and society women 's strength in this country has a very important role .
Today at the time when we are discussing women 's strength , at that time I want to mention a railway station here .
Now what is the relation of both the matters of a railway station and women 's efficiency has come in our mind .
The railway station in which all women workers are there is the first railway station in India i . . Matunga railway station in Mumbai .
There are women workers in all the departments in this station .
After seeing the passage of Prajasatak Din many people have written on the streets and other social media , the point of view in conduct is that all women were involved in ' BSAF ' by Baikar Continent ' .
These women used to use extremely adventurous and these visions also surprised the refugees coming from abroad .
Both words of energy and self-reliance are the same .
Today our women are doing leadership .
Also they are becoming self-sufficient .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new picture in front of the country .
The premises of Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism .
On the throne of violence , atrocities , bombs , bunkers , pistols , and Maoists on the threshold are making extremely horrible environment here .
In such dangerous areas tribal women are becoming self-sufficient by running ' E . . ' .
The introduction of any society 's life , change in its own way , the mechanism of reform has developed or not , it keeps on happening .
Contrary to social misconceptions , bad activity , methods , efforts are being made in our country seventy times in a personal and social way .
Recently a good attempt was made in Bihar just a few days ago .
In order to destroy social illustrations a total of 13 thousand kilometres long human range was built in the state which was the world ' s longest human credibility .
In this campaign people created awareness in society in protest against bad practices like childhood , hunting etc .
The entire state has decided to fight against the evil practices like Hunda and Balvivah .
Young people , mothers , sisters joined together or in the camp .
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patan this human range was connected to the border of the state .
All the people in the society need to get benefits from the point of view of development , therefore our society should be free from such misconceptions .
Let us go , then , together with all that we promise to destroy such evil paths from the society and create a new India , a powerful and capable India .
I take care of the people of Bihar , the chief minister of state , the administration of the state and every person involved in the human range .
But after getting information about the public medicine center they have started buying medicines from there now the cost of their father 's medicine has decreased by 75 percent .
This gives a very big financial help to the eldest citizens , especially those who want to eat medicines daily .
The ' generic ' medicines that are bought in these are the standards determined by the World Health Organisation .
Because of this reason good quality medicines can be available in cheaper rates .
Today more than three thousand public health centers have been established in the country .
By this not only medicines are getting cheaper , but individual workers also have a new chance of employment .
The cheap medicines are available in the chief minister of Indian public medicines centers and hospitals in ' Amrit Stores ' .
The only purpose of all these programs is that the poor people of the country should be provided with philosopher and adventurous health services so that a healthy and prosperous India can be formed .
My dear countrymen , Shriyut Mangesh from Maharashtra has sent a photograph on the Narendra Modi Mobile App .
In the separation of this photography my attention will be paid attention to it .
In this photograph a monk had joined with his brothers in the ' Clin Morana river ' or ' Cleanliness Mohim ' .
I got to know that the citizens of Akola have started programs to clean the ' Morana river ' in Swachh Bharat Mohammad .
Another difficult thing is that wild grass , waterfalls were flowing in the plateau of the river .
On the river and its shrines too garbage , dirt was being thrown in large quantity .
The villager created an architecture arakhada and prepared a day before Makar Sankranti , 13 January , Roshu Morana Mohim , according to which in the first phase in four kilometres the two bays of the Morana river were cleaned .
Now till the Morana river does not become completely clean , I have come to know that every Saturday morning this moment will start .
From this one can see that if man decides something to do , then something is impossible , but nothing is absolutely .
Through mass movement it can be done by making changes done by doing a lot of work .
My dear countrymen , nowadays there is a lot of discussion about Padma Purskara , we can also hear it .
Every year there is a tradition of Padma awarding but for the last three years the entire process of this award has been changed .
Now any citizen can suggest any name for this architecture .
Because of this entire process online transparency has come in them .
Now in order to give architecture the work done by that person is being kept in mind and is being introduced to him .
We must have all heard , we will be very happy to know the work of Arvind Guptaji .
Aravindji , a student of I . . . Kanpur , has spent his life in the work of making sports for small children .
Children should use scientific experiments through useless , broken things , understand the science of that demand , for this they are constantly trying .
For this he went to three thousand schools in the country and showed them in the pictures made in 18 different languages and inspired the children .
This is the same thing as Sitava Joddi of Karnataka .
They are not considered as the goddess of synthesis .
Sitava has a big contribution in bringing changes in the life of innumerable women between the last three decades .
In the seventh year of age Devadasi used to be dedicated to himself but the Sitavas spent their entire life for the welfare of the goddesses .
Not only this , they have also done great work for the welfare of group women .
We would have heard something about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh . Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor , tribal family .
He was doing a simple job for cooking but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings , paintings .
Because of this snake he has got respect not only in India but also in the whole world .
In many countries like Netherlands , Germany , England , Italy their pictures have been displayed .
In the country the name of India has been given Padmashri architecture by recognising the talent of Ghazwana Madhiya Bhajjhu Shyamji .
They have made more than five hundred forest herbs based on their memories .
After exploring these famous people they have been honored with Padmashri architecture as the pride of the social work they have done .
Today I am interested in mentioning another name here . Subhasini Mistry of 75 years between West Bengal has also been selected for Padma Architecture .
Subhasini Mistry or woman rubbed utensils in the houses of other women to build the hospital , vegetables .
Because of this crisis coming in life he got the inspiration to build a hospital for the poor .
Today in the hospital built by their untiring efforts thousands of poor people are being treated free medicine .
Padma Purskar is a medium .
Such people do not work at all for mental reconciliation .
My dear countrymen , every year on 9 January we celebrate the Indian Day of Travellers .
Puja Mahatma Gandhi had returned to India on 9th January from South Africa .
On this day we are very bonded among Indians doing architecture in India and around the world , as if festivals are celebrated .
We will surely enjoy knowing that this program was included in Malaysia , New ealand , Switzerland , Portugal , Mauritius , Fizzie , Tanzania , Kenya , Canada , Britain , Surinam , South Africa and America and many other countries of the Indian dynasty .
I want to give this information to the European Union about making a remarkable work , building the identity of the people of the original Indian dynasty and giving this information to the people of the whole world through daily observation .
Those who showed us a new way , the date of those worshippers is 30 Januaryday Puneti .
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu , whether India or Duniya , person or family or society .
Namaskar
This is the last program of this rainy season of the mother of the mind and see Yoga , today is also the last day of the year 2017 .
In this entire year we spoke on many things together and did a lot of things as well .
Innumerous leaflets coming from us for the mother of the mind , reactions , exchanges happening in them , all these would always give new energy to me .
Now this year is going to change in a few hours , but this thing , speak , your translation is going to continue .
Even in the coming year we are communicating more new topics , we are doing new experiences .
For 2018 ourselves many things are good .
At present , on 25 December a few days ago the celebration of Christmas in the whole world was celebrated with great enthusiasm .
We also get to see the emotions of serving in Bible .
The sun of man haze is less , Nottu B . . . . . . . . . .
In these bowls we can see what is magnificent , magnificent .
Whatever happens in this world , religion , tradition , character , but the invaluable form of humanity is introduced in the sense of serving .
We are talking about ' necessity work ' in our country .
Towards ourselves Paramo Dharma : Asafoetida is also called .
Life-service only Shiva - Sava and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans have said , Life-service should be done in a simple manner .
My dear countrymen , this year was 350 years of light of Gurugovind Singh Ji .
Abnormal life filled with the beauty and devotion of Guru Govind Singh Ji is inspiration for all of us .
Guru Gobind Singhji gave the preachings of great lifestyle and he also woke up on the basis of the same children .
Gurugovind Singhji worked to inspire people from all such roles of a guru, poet, philosophical-style, great war, such roles.
He fought against atrocities and injustice .
He gave the people the teaching of going and giving bondages of religion to the people .
In all these attempts he started to sleep a lot at personal level .
But they have never stopped the foolishness in the mind .
Every moment he kept giving a message of love , excitement and peace .
How great and special is their personality , it can be seen from it .
I got the opportunity to participate in the light festival program organized here , this is my fate .
One January, 2018.
We will also be surprised , new year would come . January also comes every year .
But at the time when I say specially then at that time that thing is really special .
And he inspires everyone , we will record our names in the form of murderer .
The whole of India is eager to welcome itself in the 21st century .
While becoming a mattress in the 21st century , we can also feel a gloriousness .
This is based on the basis of ' Bharata ' .
The strength of the mother in the world , this is the biggest strength .
This is the most effective means of bringing positive changes in the life of millions of people .
We only get the right to give death , not .
Then how should we be India in the 21st century , what will be our dreams in India in the 21st century
You can also become the builder of the 21st century India and its beginning is going on with specialty from one January .
It is my belief that the dream of our new India will be fulfilled on the strength of Kaushalya situated towards this powerful youth .
The time when we talk about new India , at that time it should be free from the poisons like new India racism , promises of communalism , hatred , frustration .
They should be free from uneasiness and poverty .
In new India peace , unity and harmony should be our guide power .
The youths of New India come forward and discuss how new India would be .
They also make a way for us , which has been associated with it , will become such a big group of them .
We also stay on guiding ahead , in that country will also go ahead .
Now even though we are conciliating with ourselves a thought came in my mind , can we organise a ' Mock Parliament ' in every district of India
In this program the youth of 18 to 25 years of age gather together , can they make this young man by making a view on ' India ' question , researching various ways , doing so plan
Before the year 2022 how can we be able to achieve our composition by the way of principle
What can we do to build India in dreams seen by our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi used to be the form of a mass movement on the slope of freedom .
My newcomer colleagues , today it is necessary that we should also stand a mass movement for magnificent India in the 21st century .
Today innumerable new opportunities have been made for youth .
Our youths are coming forward from cultivation to neo-synthesis and in emergence and are also successful .
I feel , or the knowledge of all the plans or how the youth of India can get the same place , by considering how to create an independent strong system .
My beloved countrymen , in the last time ' Mon Ki Baat ' I used to tell us how much importance is there .
For those people who have positiveness and enthusiasm any work is easy , possible .
People in English are saying . Pesimimimism Lids To Vekness , Optimism To Power I used to take care of the countrymen in the last time , in the year 2017 we have experienced positive moments , show them the information and welcome to 2018 in such positive environment .
People have given a lot of very positive competition and have made their experiences shower on the ' May Gav ' and ' Narendra Modi Ape ' of social media .
Some people have done some special work in their personal life , the information of this has also been done .
My name is Minu Bhatia .
I live here in Mayur Vihar , Pocket One , Faiz One , Delhi .
My Kanela M.

This corpse will give me very easily and my child will be able to continue learning .
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade .
I speak from Bodol here.
My name is Santosh Jadhav .
The work of national highway is being done in 2017 from this village of our variety .
That is why the roads have become very good here and business is enjoying .
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja .
I work in Mohalla Sadatganj of Saharanpur district in Uttar Pradesh .
My name is Satis Bevani .
There was a very serious problem of water in our part , for 40 years we were dependent on the aquatic waterways .
Now there is an independent waterfall for us .
Then , along with the joys getting from such small things we entered the new year , deciding , determined steps from the start of the new year towards the first India .
Now we are discussing all positiveness , therefore I also want to talk about one thing here .
Recently , information about Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk received the best place in the administrative service test in Kashmir is giving me a lot of encouragement .
The admiration of oppression and oppression came out of this environment and achieved the first number of them in the Kashmir administrative service test .
The story of success was written by them only .
Today Anjum has become an inspiration place not only of Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth classes of the entire country .
However bad the situation may be done by the medium of positive work the dirt of disappointment can be destroyed , it proves to be irregular .
Recently , in the last week I got an opportunity to visit some of the Kannas of Jammu and Kashmir .
I used to take information about the desires of those who were enthusiastic , who were dreaming of them .
In which fields of life there is desire to make them progress , they used to tell them all about it . This was a very good crowd of people who lived with great hope .
I am feeling disappointed while talking to them , there is no unconsciousness in them .
There used to be enthusiasm among them , joy , joy , excitement , great energy , great dreams , compositions were there .
Or the time I spent with the Kashmiri people , at that time I also got very inspiration from them .
This is my youth today . This is the future of my country .
My dear countrymen , not only in our country but also in the famous religious places of the world , at that time it is natural to know about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala .
In this world famous temple for the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami , Kottayambhavati emotions come every year .
P.
Nobody is big in this campaign , no one is small .
Every traveller understands a part of the worship of the god , does some or the other work cleanly .
Now there is any big celebrity in it , any big money , or entrepreneur working on the big post , everybody participates in the program like normal travellers or purnayam reconstruction .
There are many such examples for our countrymen .
At the same time along with the hard work medium hard work of cleaning is also taken .
My beloved countrymen , on 2 October , 214 worshipper Jayanti Dini we all have made a compilation to mix up and free from uneasiness .
Towards cleanliness efforts are being made in a wide range throughout the country .
Due to the participation of people at a wide level in rural areas also changes are visible .
In urban areas how much of the level of cleanliness is available , how much success is achieved , in order to take care of this the world 's largest survey is being done in the period of 4th January to 10th March 2118 .
This survey is being done in more than four thousand cities of the country and about 40 crore population .
In this there is an attempt to make people involved in this work , to create capacity and to use some new institutions for cleaning , to collect garbage , to take garbage , vehicle system , scientific methods , to change people 's habits .
During this survey different paths are being tested .
After discussing with the citizens they have to know their reactions .
How is the use of ' cleansing app ' and they are being analyzed to improve the various types of services .
The task of keeping cleanliness is only the government , but not at all .
Whereas every urban and urban organizations are also very responsible for maintaining cleanliness .
And every citizen of mine has the aim that everyone should participate in the cleanliness survey in large numbers .
And do not ask for the cleaning of the city , envisage your cart , your society not to fall back .
The habit of classifying dry garbage , wet garbage , dry garbage , now you must have felt and you are using blue and green garbage while putting garbage .
The principle of ' radius , riuse and recycling ' proves to be extremely effective for the production of garbage .
According to this survey of clean cities if the population of our city is more than one lakh then if there is less than one lakh population in the entire country then the highest number should be achieved in the regional sequence , it should be our dream .
And we should also try .
And the dream of all of us should be that the city - our effort is ' the progress of our progress - country ' .
Come then , after doing such a composition we once again recalled the efforts of fulfilling the composition of clean India by remembering the worshippers .
My dear countrymen , there are some things that look very small to see them but if we look at them as a society then we become our identity .
Today through this program of ' Mon Ki Baat ' I want to do something similar with me .
I realized that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Haj pilgrimage then she can not go to ' maharam ' or her male palanquin only .
Specially , such bonds , rules are not even in Islamic countries .
But in India only Muslim women did not get this right .
And I am very happy to pray here , that our government should take care of this thing .
I have complete faith , and my firm belief is that the journey of India 's development is going forward on the belief of our women and strength among them .
And therefore our women should also get equal rights , equal chances , therefore their seventy efforts should start and on the path of progress women and men should go forward properly .
My dear countrymen , 26 January is a historical festival for us .
This year on 26 January , 218 the day is specially remembered .
This year on the day of the month of Prajasattaka all the ten Asian countries are coming to India as the leader of the country .
This year Prajasattaka Din has not only one but ten main guests .
The year 20017 has become special from both the countries of Asia and India .
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and in 2001 the partnership of India with ASEAN completed 25 years .
It is a matter of respect for all our Indians to participate with these great leaders of 10 countries worldwide on 26 January .
Beloved countrymen , today the days of festivals are start . If we see that our country is a country of festivals in a way .
Perhaps no such day can be told that no festival is celebrated on that day .
Let the next new year bring all of us a lot of joy , happiness and prosperity .
We went ahead with all new zeal , new enthusiasm , new joy and new composition .
In the month of January the Uttaranchal of the sun starts , this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated , this festival is associated with nature .
If you say Sankranti in Rajasthan then Magh - Bihu in Assam , then Pongal is in Tamil Nadu .
All these are generally celebrated in 13th to 17th January .
Very blessed, dear countrymen.
Now we will speak this again in 2018 .
There is no respect for them , such Indian citizens will not even be able to find out .
That age is very bigger than all of us and are witnesses of different phases of the country .
Before leaving for foreign couple I got the privilege of condolences from the distance along with the day .
Talk to your elder sister in a small sense , like this we had this lovely translation .
I do not actually speak much about this kind of personal language .
Listen that even on this turn of life Latadidi is eager for all things related to the country .
The spirit of resolving their life is associated with the progress of India , changing India , the new peaks of progress are connected to India .
Modi ji: Latadi Namskar
I am speaking Narendra Modi .
Lata ji : Homodi ji : I am in the air journey .
Lata ji: Achha, Achha.
What to celebrate on the day .
And this proverb which we have achieved has been achieved through meditation and posture only .
I am really nothing .
Lata ji: Yeah.
Your letters also keep getting me and I also get the gifts sent by you .
I do not want to give you much trouble because I see , I imagine how much work you work and how much work you have to think about .
Modi ji : My mother was very happy because of the affection you expressed .
Lata ji : Homodi ji : But I am young soon .
There will be a lot of festivals throughout the country for the coming several weeks .
Your house will be filled with happiness .
Only we have seen that there are many such people around us who stay devoid of the joy of these qualities .
The blindness under the direction is called it .
Mostly this saying is not just words but it is an order for us , there is a philosophy , an inspiration .
When sweets , clothes , gifts come out in our houses , then for one minute this gift should go out , think of that .
At least the things which are more than necessary in our house , which we do not use now , certainly do the work of giving them out to the needy .
In many cities , many such organizations work with the start apps of young co - workers .
They collect essential things like clothes , cereals , food from homes of people and find out the needs and reach those things till them .
Smile boiling on the face of many poor families , multiplicate their joy , shine will come more on your face , your day will be more lightening and your day will shine even more .
My beloved brother Bhaginino , comes to Lakshmi home in the form of good luck and prosperity in Diwali , traditionally Lakshmi is welcomed .
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this year
In our culture girls have been considered Lakshmi because girls bring good fortune and prosperity .
This year can we organise programs for the honor of girls in our society , villages , cities
Can we program for the honor of these Lakshmis of India in this year on Diwali
There are many girls around us , many hearings which are doing abnormal work .
Somebody does the work of teaching poor children , somebody does the work of living in the matter of cleanliness and health , someone is doing the service of society by becoming a doctor or an engineer , is trying to justify someone .
Your society should recognize such people , honor them and take care of them .
The program of such honor should be done throughout the country .
Another work can be done.
Regarding the success of these girls surveill more information through Soshal Media and use this handtag for ' Laxmi ' .
Selfie with Daughter this great majesty was we renounced and it was spread all over the world, in the same way at this time we also come to the shrine of Laxmi .
Promoting this program of Lakshmi in India means to enable the path of prosperity of country and countrymen .
My beloved countrymen , I had said behind itself that there is a greater advantage of the activity of the mind that I have the privilege of making public or indirect translation with many familiar and unknown persons .
A few days back a student of Arunachal Pradesh Alina Tayang has sent me a chain patriot and he has written in it , I read that patriot before me .
I stay here in Roeing of Arunachal Pradesh .
This year when my test took place , some people thought you read the book Ekzam Warriors .
I told them that I have not read this book .
But on going again I bought this book and read it two - three times .
After that my experience would have been very good .
If I had read this book before testing then I felt that if it benefited a lot .
I feel that if we think about the new diversity of this book then certainly include some more mantras for the readers and teachers , some more interests .
Exam Warriors also read this book twice or three times about blessings and reading , what are the deficiencies in it , many admirations about telling me .
My little friend has also given me a job , has been instructed to do something .
I will definitely follow my instructions .
Whatever we have said that when the new introduction of this book comes , I will definitely try to write something to the readers and the teachers in it .
But can we all help me in this work that I might lead us all
What are your experiences to live everyday .
I once again consider Alina Tyang of our original friend of Arunachal .
Through my beloved countrymen , present clothes , through the medium of photography you are getting information about the work programs of the fathers of the country , you also talk about it .
But you know that even me is a common human like you , is a common citizen and therefore the same effect on what is seen on a common life happens on my own life , because I am also one among you .
Then I also listened to the speeches and also saw the face .
Just a few times before this description he was defeated in the last journey by the king Rafael Nadal of the Grand Slam cracking 19 times and Tennis world .
The visitors present there welcomed them with enthusiasm .
He also made a lot of caution about Dainata Nadal , how did Nadal inspire young men to play tennis .
Even after being sufficient in comparison with the atrocity he kept in front of the world an excellent example of playing .
Although at the same time on the other hand winner Nadal also encouraged the sports of the donor .
In this the people of every class and every age can be taught , this is a lot of things .
These are such moments , they are crossing jingling or losing while victory or defeat does not have much meaning .
The thoughts of our ancestors were really curiosity .
Vidya Vinay neglector Hartin Nurnissi kasya Manujya Manikaran Sangam : Janayati Loksya Lochan Andam i . . when the qualification and moisture in any person comes together , then that person will not live a good mind .
Actually this youth player has won the heart of all the people of the world .
My dear countrymen , and especially my young friends , what I want to say is actually telling for your good .
The debate will continue , the difference between the birds will continue , only if some things are stopped fast before spreading then there will be great benefit from them .
The things which increase fast , spread fast , becomes difficult after stopping those things .
In the beginning only if we stay awake and stop it then many things can be saved .
From this point of view I feel today , specially I feel to speak something to my dear boys .
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health , it becomes even more difficult to leave intoxication .
Because of nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in it .
By its consumption in young age there is adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I want to speak with me about a new subject .
We would know that as soon as we saw the e - cigarette bonds were implemented in India .
E cigarette is such an electronic tool apart from regular cigarettes .
Because of hot liquid substances with nicotine in cigarettes a kind of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is consumed .
We have a lot of information about the danger of cigarettes often , only e e cigarettes have been spread that there is no danger from e cigarette .
Its smell does not spread like other cigarettes , therefore aromatic chemicals are used in it .
We have seen around us that there are big chenusmokers in many houses , even then they prevent others from smoking , stop .
The point of E cigarette is different .
If someone smokes around us then he understands us from his place .
If there is a packet of cigarette in someone 's skin then also he understands only from the house .
Only E cigarette is not such a thing because of which many teenagers and youngsters are unaware and sometimes in their books , in their dreams , sometimes in their skulls and sometimes taking e cigarettes in their hands and then become intoxicated .
Youth generation is the future of the country .
This type of intoxication should not be aimed at making your youth free , therefore cigarettes have been banned .
In order to prevent the dreams of the family from getting destroyed , the life of the children does not apply to the country , because of the habit of intoxication the hands and feet should not spread in the society , this condition has been laid .
I prefer all of us to leave this intoxication of tobacco and do not take any care of e - cigarettes .
Or we all build a healthy India together.
Hey, do you remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that we go to the gym for two hours morning and evening , so much .
For fit India one also has to stay away from all these intoxications .
My beloved brethren , our country , many such unusual people who spend their lives for the welfare of others have remained the birthplace and activity , this is really a good thing for us .
India is the birthplace of many such strange people , activity and this is such people who have not only given their life to the welfare of others .
One such great person is being honored on 13th October in Rosie Vetican City .
This is surely a matter of pride for every Indian . Pope Francis will be declared as a saint on 13th October Rose Mary Thressia .
Sister Mary Thressia has done the work of human welfare only in his young age of fifty years , that is a unique example for the whole world .
He was very unhappy about social service and education sector .
He built many schools , houses and orphanages .
He established the Congression of those citizens of that holy family , which is still fulfilling their livelihood and love even today .
I often offer homage to Syster Mary Thressia and especially the Indian people , especially our Christian brothers and sisters rejoice in the mind about this success .
My beloved countrymen , not only for India but for the whole world it is a matter of pride that despite celebrating Gandhiji ' s 150th birth anniversary 130 crore Indians have made a plan to become free from single Use plastic .
Seeing what India has taken the role of leadership towards environment conservation , today the views of the countries of the world are being implemented towards India .
All of you are going to participate in the aim of getting rid of the Single Youth Plastic on October 2 , I believe this .
At this place people are contributing in this discipline in their own way , only a young man in our country has begun to lose a lover in a unique way .
When I noticed their work then I sang with them from a distance and tried to understand their new experiment .
Perhaps the translation with them would also be useful to some other people of the country .
Sri Yut Rippudman Belviji is making a unique attempt .
When I first heard the word plaguing then it would also be new for me .
You are playing this entire program in a delicate way and specially , in this way you will like young people .
I enjoy my heart .
And Mitraho , this year Fit India Plogging Run is also organizing the renowned Krida Ministry of honorary fathers .
Two kilometers of plugging on October 2.
This program is being organized throughout the country .
How to do this program , what happens in the program , we have heard from the experience of republic .
Through this point awareness of cleanliness along with public awareness towards health among people is also increasing .
If 130 crore Indians take a step towards getting rid of the single usual plastic use then I feel as if India will go 130 crore steps together .
Republican , once again very much of yourself .
We , our spoon and our imagination have many miracles of my kind .
I want to tell you something about one thing.
Actually in the future mind ' s program you must tell about it in detail , just today I tell you something earlier that you will get a chance to prepare .
Keep in mind that on 31 October the anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is there .
So let us start preparing for it from now on .
There is a lot of time to talk about it further .
Some people can start the procession , some other plans can also be prepared .
My dear countrymen , you will remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that for 2022 years we would visit India fifteen places .
Programme for staying at at least fifteen places and one - two nights .
We should see India , understand , experience .
There is so much variety towards us .
And when people come on holidays because of Diwali , then definitely go to tour , so I once again predict that we must go to any fifteen places of India .
My beloved countrymen , now the festival has been celebrated on 27th September everyday world tourism day and some responsible institutions of the world synthesis about tourism . You will surely be happy to know that there has been improvement in the place of India in competitive direction of tourism .
And all this has become possible because of the co-operation of all of us , especially because of knowledge of the importance of tourism it has become possible .
If we try again then despite the completion of 75 years of independence we can definitely get the highest place among the major tourist places of the world .
There should be joy , enthusiasm too .
These varieties are celebrated together , celebrated together , therefore from these musical instruments also get a new potential of social life .
My dear countrymen, Namskar.
A few days back the opportunity of contacting the children of Karnataka is beneficial for me .
The ' Vijay Karnataka ' of Times Group has a sympathy of Rabwala , in which he has instructed the children to send a portion to the children , the fathers .
If children are given more information about nature then they will be appropriate in future for environment protection , they also have written .
The daughter named Reda Nadaf of Lakshmaswara has written that she is the daughter of a young man in Lashkar and she feels admirable of this thing .
Does not any Indian feel the glory of the jewel in Lashkar
And why are you the guests of that folk , it is absolutely natural for you to feel respect .
Irfna Begum has said from Kalburgi that his school is at a distance of 5 kilometres from his village , so he has to get out of his house soon and he also gets late to return home .
That is why they can not play with their friends for a long time , they have done such information that they should have a school near their house .
The people of the country , with a present patriot , this kind of work was done and that is why I could reach me later , I got the opportunity to save it .
This was a very good experience for me .
My dear countrymen , today is 2611 .
November 26 is its convenience day .
In 1949 on the day of today the Conventional Civilization accepted the incident of India .
On 26 January 1950 the humidity of the rosary federation started and therefore we celebrate this day on 26 January as the day of the day of the month .
The state of India is the soul of our state .
Today 's day is the day of the memories of members of the conference .
For the construction of the treaty he took strict precaution for about three years .
No field of life , any subject of nature has been dissolved in it .
Equality and sensitivity for everyone , this is the identity of our state .
It is our duty to maintain the distinction of our state .
Whether citizen or administrator , everyone should quote the contract accordingly .
There is no harm to any one , this is the message of state destruction .
Among these Mussoorie community was one of the most important confluences .
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the teacher of that committee .
He feels a very big role .
The welfare of every class of society will be done by them .
On 6th December , on the day of their grandeur we recall them , dedicate them .
There is a great contribution of Babasaheb to make the country rich and affordable .
On 15th December is the Punetith of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
Sardar Patel , who created such identity from the father of the farmer to the iron man , also did unusual work to build the country in a uniform source .
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Conventional Civilization .
He was also a teacher of the advisory committee for basic rights , minorities and tribals .
Only nine years ago on the day of today on 26th day there was a terrorist attack on Mumbai , even this country could not forget .
Today the virgin citizens , polio and security guards who have lost their lives , remind them of the country .
The country will never forget their sacrifice .
It has been decorated to destroy human power .
And that is why not only India but also all humanitarian powers of the world should come together and defeat the oppression .
Born on this land Lord Buddha , Lord Mahavir , Guru Nanak , Mahatma Gandhi have given the message of non - violence and love to the world .
Terrorism and bourgeoisie are trying to eliminate our social structure by weakening it .
And therefore stay more aware of humanitarian powers , this time is necessary .
My dear countrymen , on 4th December we celebrate the day of the morning .
Indian boats preserve their seashores .
I enjoy everyone related to Naudala .
We must know that our culture has developed in the coastal areas of the rivers itself .
Whether it is the Indus river , the Ganges river , Yamuna or Saraswati . Our rivers and sea are economic and strategic , both of these things are important .
These are the entrances of the whole world .
This country has a substantial relationship with the oceans of our land .
When we look at history then at the time of the mule dynasty 800 - 900 years before the mule dynasty the king ' s boat was counted .
In the expansion of the territory of the mule empire , at that time his Naudalacha Singh wanted to bring the empire in the form of economic power .
Several examples of museums , monasteries , monasteries of Majesty are available in Sangam literature even today .
In most of the boats of the world in later times women were given permission , this would be very less people cheated .
Only in the ruins , and that too 800 - 900 years before women had made pearl works .
Just in the war also these women had joined .
Marg rulers were aware of the construction of the ship .
While mentioning Naudala how can you forget the capability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his Naudala as well
The terrain of Konkan with ocean species was included in the state of Shivaji Maharaj .
Sindhu Durga , Murud - Janjira , Golden Durga associated with Shivaji Maharaj were many forts in the coastal part or standing in the sea itself .
The boats of Marathas used to preserve these forts .
In this campaign of Marathas big and small boats are included .
His nausalites were inspired to attack any enemy and defend themselves from hail .
Be aware of Maratha Arma and do not mention Kanhoji English , this is only impossible .
He gave new grandeur to the Armara of Marathas and at many places he got the foundation of Maratha soldiers .
Even after getting independence Indian boating has made many acquaintances .
Whether it is Goa free war or the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971 .
The INS Sumitra of our boat helped the warrior to escape from the tetanus and supplied many mosquitoes safely out of the water to Bangladesh .
This year in the month of May - June when a huge pool came in Sri Lanka then three boats of our boats reached there and they helped the government and the people there .
In Bangladesh Rohingyasandharbhat had helped humans by this war boat of the INS Gadiaal of his boat .
In June the Papua New Guinea Government gave us the SOS message and helped our boat to save the mosquitoes of their mosquitoes .
On 21 November everyday in West Galf even during the attacks made by sea shores on a merchant ship , the INS Tricolor of his boat also ran for the help of the war boat .
This day of expressing respect and respect towards the security forces of the country . This year the Ministry of Conservation has decided to run a special campaign between 1 to 7 December .
For the entire week , small children , big girls , everyone put the national flag .
There should be an association to express the respect of the nation .
On this occasion we can disperse the flag of the Lashkari group .
If your acquaintances are related to any sanctuary then their experience , their religious activities , paintings and photographs related to them can be posted here .
In schools , colleges by inviting the people of Sania more information can be taken from them about the work of Sanya .
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about Sanya .
This is also the opportunity to collect money for the welfare of all the soldiers of our conservation group .
This fund is used for the families of the martyred soldiers , for the welfare of the injured soldiers , for their rehabilitation .
Come , let us also give this contribution today to lift the morale of our cheap senses .
Whether we also apply handloom for their welfare .
My dear countrymen , on 5th December is the world 's soil day .
I want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters as well .
Soil meaning soil is an important factor of the earth .
Whatever we eat , everything is related to this soil .
In one way the entire food is connected to the soil only .
Think , if there is no nutritious soil in the world then what will happen
How to survive
In our culture it has been considered a long time ago and because of that we have been aware of the importance of soil since long time .
In our culture on one side the feeling of farming , soil reproductive devotion and respect should be completely natural in the mind of the people , along with this the use of many scientific methods also continued to nurturing the soil .
In the life of the fielders of this country there is a lot of importance to the two bubblers , along with the devotion of their soil and along with it they will take care of them from the point of view of scientific point of view .
The farming traditions of our country are connected with and along with this modern sciences are also aware , they use it in the field , we all feel the meaning of it .
I have heard about the Tohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh , Bhoranj Block and the fields there .
The farmers there used to use chemical treasures in an unbalanced manner , due to which the quality of the soil there was declining .
The production was declining , due to which the production of fields also decreased and the production of soil also decreased .
Some awakening farmers in the village recognized the situation seriously and after that the farmers of the village tested their soil as much as they were advised to use nutrients and biological expense .
On hearing the results we will all feel surprised that what information was given to the farmers through soft health cards , which got guidance , the positive results of his lifestyle were seen .
In the production of wheat in Rabbi 216-17 a total of three to four times increased and in the production also a total of four to six thousand rupees increased .
If you pay attention to Pick then you should take care of the soil . If you take care of this land , Damy mother then you will also take care of yourself , it is now also going to the farmers .
Get a better information of your soil and take a drink accordingly , for this more than 100 crore farmers from all over the country have prepared a soft health card .
Do we consider how dangerous we are for the health of this Dammite mother
The damage of the earth occurs due to more than necessary , it has proved to be from many scientific experiments .
The farmer is the son of this dam mother then how will she give her mother a disease
It is necessary to revive this relation of mother and son .
For 2022 years , i . . the freedom of the country would be 75 years , would we have the composition of bringing the use of the uria for our farming to us
Once the sons of Damy mother , the farmers made this plan that the health of the dam , the health of the earth will improve rapidly , production will also increase .
There will be change in the life of the farmer with the right meaning .
World temperature increase , change in environment , we have started feeling this now .
There was a time when the cold started on the day before .
Now on coming to December it is cold and the entire cold winter starts .
The cold started that it does not seem to get out of the bed , it is the experience of all of us .
In this season also people with awareness work effectively and their examples inspire everyone .
Only determination and composition was bigger than all these , powerful .
The eight-year-old son could not speak , but he took the base of Shitti .
On waking up at 5 in the morning this daughter used to go to the house of the village and tell about not doing toilet on open .
Due to the efforts of this child who learned cleanliness by going to at least 30 - 40 houses everyday this village became free from the open toilet .
Every moment one gets to learn something new .
Today they are doing good work in every area .
Whether it is sports , competition , social program , our Divyang is not behind anything .
We all remember , in the Rio Olympic competition our Diamond players earned 4 medals while playing the best and also the World Head of the T-Twenty Cricket of the blind .
Several kinds of competitions are started throughout the country .
A few days back in Udaipur 17 widow national para water supply was organised .
80 percent of their body parts do not have muscles , but only see their patience , synthesis and henna .
Even in the 70-year national parasite water supply, he jinked a golden serpent, and because of his own square, the Indian creed for 200-20 paralympics chose them.
They are included in 32 Para waterfalls and all these are being trained in the excellence center of Gujarat .
I greet this thread of young zebras and give them a glimpse .
After a few days Id-e-Milad-Un-Nabi will be celebrated .
On that day the prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born .
I give horrific charm to all the countrymen and to increase the calmness and harmony of Eid in this society I feel such hope that I will give new inspiration to all of us , new energy will be able to make a new project .
-LRB- phone call -RRB- is the chief minister , I speak Neeraj Singh from Kanpur .
My destiny is to tell us the best ten things that you have told us through the mother of mind in the year so that we will recall that thing and we will be able to learn something more new .
We have done a lot of good information .
After listening to my words I feel sorry in it , changing it .
Whatever old and old demands are there in the village towards us , he always says , forgive meditation , do not forget happiness .
Then whether that photo , whether it is a little bit , whether it is a thing or a little lyrics . I invite you to welcome 2018 with magnificent memories .
Or, on the Narendramodi App, MyGov or Social Media, Posiative India (Hashtag Positique India) shuffle positive partner.
Remove the incidents of inspiration to others .
Or we see the strength of accumulated efforts and its effect together .
I would definitely try to reach the people of the country the experience that came upon the National Policy India in the next chapter of ' Mon Ki Baat ' .
My dear countrymen , in the next month , for the mother of the mind , once again we have to convey to everyone .
There will be a chance to speak many things .
Many jealousy
Sixth day celebrated after Deepavali is one of the census celebrated in our country with loyalty .
In which there are traditional rules from diet to childhood .
Sixth-fourth century incomparable mountains are completely connected with nature and the worship of nature .
Sun and water , these Mahaparva are at the center of six sub-divisions , whereas utensils and utensils made of bamboo and soil , this is a suitable material for worship .
Duniya worships growing , but in sixth time we also give a summit to worship them , which is fixed .
The importance of cleanliness in our life is also included in this condition .
Cleanliness of the entire house , along with cleaning of the river , pond , shores , shores , shores of worshipping places all people enthusiastically .
Suryavandana or Chhath Puja - Pavaran protection , disease prevention and admonition are the same .
Eat something ordinarily, it's deficiencies, humorous feelings
But after half of the morning in sixth day take the prasad after asking , this is a special tradition .
Prasad is said to be the reason behind eating , due to which ego is destroyed , ego is such an emotion that is obstacle in the progress of the person .
It is extremely natural for people to believe this great tradition of India .
But when I look at the effect of ' Mother Ki Baat ' then my belief becomes firm that with the people of the country the mother of the mother 's mother 's mother ' has been built in a hundred percent season .
Take khadi and handloom examples .
We will always enjoy knowing Gandhi Jayanti what is the effect of handmade , khadi and what is its effect .
Let me tell you that on the day of 17th October , on the day of Dhantrayodshi , a sale of one crore twenty lakh rupees was registered in Khadi Gramodyog Bhawan Store of Delhi .
We have enjoyed hearing this that khadi and handlooms are sold at such a large amount from one store , so that we have been satisfied .
During Deepavali , the sale between Khadi Gift Kuppan has increased approximately 680 percent .
In comparison to the sale of khadi and handicrafts and handicraft items this year about 90 percent has increased .
Today youths , adults , women , in every age group people like khadi and handloom , these paintings are seen .
I can imagine how many times the families , poor families , families working on handlooms have been benefitted from this business .
But from the experience of the past few years I can say that after ' Khadi for Nation ' and ' Khadi for Fashion ' the place of ' Khadi for Transfermation ' has now been acquired .
In the life of poor people , handmade poor people , making changes in the life of poor people , making them efficient , efficient , powerful means are formed .
This is a big role for the program .
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App , he wants to know about the experiences of my security team in Deepavali and he has to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali .
Mr . Tejas Gaikwad also considered the Narendra Modi App , is there an arrangement for our sweets to reach the security forces
We also remind of our heroic security force .
We felt that sweets of our house should be taken to the people of the country .
Deepavali has all been celebrated with great enthusiasm .
For me also Diwali brought a special experience at this time .
On the border , facing the difficult and toxic situations , the security forces protect themselves from the country , I respect the security forces of all the countrymen for association , dedication and dedication .
When you get time , you will get relief , at that time you should understand the experience of the people , you should listen to their glory .
Many of our people do not know that their youths not only protect their borders but they are playing an important role in reliability .
Everyone knows about the efforts of the United States to establish peace in the whole world , their positive landmass .
And we are considered to be the community family i . . this world is my family , association .
Due to this belief from the beginning itself India is active in different directions of UAN .
Everyone knows that in both the words ' The Pepple ' starts with the exhibition of India 's knee and the exhibition of UAN Charter .
India has always emphasized on the equality of women and UNK declaration of human hakka is the same lifestyle .
What was done in his Indian Frame is that it was changed with the efforts of ' All Men and Borne Free and Equal ' India 's representative Hansa Mehta and then it was accepted as ' All Human Bings of Borne Free And Equal ' .
If we see this then this little change , but only a positive view would be there in them .
The important contribution of India through UN Amber is that India ' s role in UN Peaking Operations .
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have provided their services in UN Peaking operations .
Generally seven thousand soldiers were included in ' N Peacekeeping ' and this is the third highest number in the whole world .
By August of 217 , Indian soldiers have arranged service in at least 50 operations between 71 piscings .
This journey of peace has been done through Korea , Kambodia , Laos , Whiyatnam , Kango , Siprayag , Libraria , Lebanon , Sudan and some countries .
In Kango and South Sudan , 200 thousand patients were treated in the Indian Army hospital and they would save countless people .
Indian security guard , not only did the people of different countries , but also the minds of those people .
Indian women also have an important , leading role in making peace .
India is the only country in Library to send women police units in India , it is very less people know .
And in India these steps will prove to be inspiration for the countries of the world .
After this all the countries started sending their women police unit .
The role of India is not only related to peace campaign but we will feel respected by hearing this that India gives peace and imperfection training in 85 countries .
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha his descendants have given a message of peace and harmony throughout the world .
Shantinia , this is not easy work .
Going to our security guards in the inaccessible areas you will start doing this work .
Their memory blossoms the pride of every countrymen .
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, heroic men, who glorify the Mercury.
Lieutenant General Premchandji made a special identity in Sipras .
In 1989 , in the year 72 they were appointed as Namibiat , Fores Commander for operation and they gave their services to ensure independence in that country .
General Thimayya , who was the Chief of the Indian Army , would also bow down to the UN Peacekeeping Forecast in Cyprus .
As a messenger of peace , India has always given an instruction of peace , unity and harmony .
We believe that everybody should live peace , goodwill and move ahead with the point of view of creating a better , calm future .
My beloved patriots , our blessings have been decorated with such great personalities , who have served humanity without any sense .
Sister Nivedita , whom we call Bhagini Nivedita , is also one of these ordinary people .
Margaret Elizabeth was born as Nobel in that Ireland but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Niwadita .
Protect means , completely dedicated .
Later , they proved themselves by working in accordance with the name .
The last Sister Niwadita was one and a half hundred Jayanti .
The corner of Swami Vivekananda was so impressed that he excavated his joyful life and dedicated himself to the service of the poor .
Syster Niwadita was very upset with the atrocities happening in British rule .
The British not only made our country pink but also tried to make us pink mentally .
Because of the deficiency of our culture the inferior construction rays , these are always going on .
Bhagni Niwaditaji reconstructed the glory of Indian culture .
After awakening the national consciousness they did the work of keeping people unconscious .
On going to various countries around the world he raised voice against the opponents of Sanatan religion and philosophy .
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramaniam Bharti is famous for its revolutionary poem Pudumari Pennel , New Woman and Women 's Saktikaran .
Assumed that they were inspired by Bhagini Niwadita .
Bhagni Niveditaji also helped great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu.
Through your writing and analysis help in improving and spreading these things .
This is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in each other in our culture .
Sister Niwadita and scientist Jagadishchandra Basu are the best examples .
In 1899 the brain plague occurred in Kolkata , seeing that hundreds of people died .
Syster Niwedita does not take care of her health and start the work of cleaning the roads .
She was such a woman who could live a comfortable life , she was connected to those poor people only .
People , taking inspiration from their organs help them in the service .
They taught people cleaning and serving from their ears .
It was written on his memorial , ' Higher Repose Sister Niwedita , Geve Har All To India ' - Sister Niwedita is resting here , who will give us the whole of India .
Undoubtedly , they are the same calls .
Abhorred about your phone call .
First of all , all the children of the child celebrated on the birthday of their first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru very happy
Children are the heroes of the construction of new India .
First of all the diseases occurring in adult age , this is our concern . This disease is seen in the last stage of life - they are also seen in small children .
Such diseases in young people also used to be from exception .
Only now our lifestyle has changed .
Such diseases are now known as lifestyle disorder .
Such diseases occur in young age meaning reduction in physical activity and changes in dieting .
Social and family should take care of this matter , this is important .
When we consider it then we will come to know that there is no need to do anything faster .
Just need , small things are correct methods , changing your habits regularly , changing your nature
Instead of going to the lips of children i . . lips put the habit of climbing the genitals .
After dinner , try to go with the entire family members .
Yoga for Young India
This yoga , especially our youth friends will be helpful in making lifestyle self-confidence and preventing lifestyle disorder .
The speciality of yoga is that yoga is simple and sufficient .
And I tell it for so much , yoga , any adult person can easily do it .
It is easy to learn , easy methods and to do all this , whatever it is done .
For this there is no need of special equipment - support , field .
My beloved countrymen , especially in my youth friends , in the area of Crida in the last few days good news came .
In various areas the name of the country is Ujwal Kel .
The Asia Cup of Hockey Trophy inkly playing Indians in Hockey.
Our players performed the best sportsmen and on this sacrifice India became Asia 's Champion after ten years .
Earlier in 2003 and 2007 India became Asia Cup champion .
Or hygienic skins and their pathetic shadows are very happy with the countrymen .
After the hockey there are also chalks in Bedminton .
Bedminton star Kidambi Srikantan has filled the country with the honor of winning the Denmark Open Trophy doing excellent game .
After the opening of Indonesia Open and Australia this is their third Super Syrig Premier award .
Friend, or take the FIFA Enter Sventin World Cupches in the month.
Many unions all over the world came to India and on football ground they showed their faculty .
I also got a chance to see a face .
There was a lot of enthusiasm in players and administrators .
World cup's big event, the whole world was watching us.
I am surprised to see such a huge face and the energy , enthusiasm of young craftsmen , something to do .
Watch the World Coffee Organisation successful and all the unions perform the best .
Even if India did not get charming , only Indian sportsmen jinned everyone 's mind .
This festival of all worlds playing with India has been celebrated and this complete competition has become thrilling and entertaining for football lovers .
Footballs are getting signs of future lightening .
Once again I enjoy all the players , their colleagues and all the players enjoy , wishes .
To justify the feelings of the people who write me on my dear countrymen , clean India , I will have to do this program everyday and only to dedicate my mind to the subject of cleanliness .
Some small girls send photos of their efforts and some cases of youth group are there in them .
Wherever there is a story of the new program of cleanliness then because of the zeal of some authority there is a promise of change in mind .
A few days back I got a detailed account , in which there is a story of Kayapalata amidst Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra .
There is a voluntary organization named Ecological Protection Organization for cleanliness campaign in Chandrapur Fort .
People do not stop , neither tired nor work for the cleaning of a component fort in the running or running for two hundred days .
Seeing the photo I am amazed and who saw this photo , in whose heart there is unsuccessful disappointment , he also feels as if dreams are fulfilled , then my people have to say that you can see the youths of the Ecological Protection Organization , their sufferings , grief , their sympathy with this picture .
Seeing it turns into your own disappointment .
My dear countrymen , on 4th November we celebrate all Guru Nanak Jayanti .
Guru Nanak Devji is not only the first guru of the Sikhs but he is the world guru .
He thought of the entire human welfare , he told all the species together .
They filled women with efficiency and women honor .
Guru Nanak Devji traveled 28 thousand kilometers and during this journey he taught the truth humanity .
They sang with the people , they showed the path of truth , patience and duties .
He gave the message of social harmony and this learning was not only shown by speaking but also showed it to his career .
They started the anchor, which resulted in the construction of services in the population.
Due to eating together the feeling of unity and equality in the people became aware .
Guru Nanak Devji gave three instructions of meaningful life - memorize , work , work and help while needing .
Guru Nanak Devji had constructed ' Gurbani ' to tell his element .
In the coming 2019 we are celebrating Guru Nanak Devji for five and a half thousand light years .
Then let us try to wait on their message and learning path .
My dear countrymen , two days i . . on 31 October we celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patelji .
We know that they were the footsteps of unbroken modern India .
Today we can learn a lot from the life of this great saint of Mother India .
The speciality of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is that he does not only give transformative ideas , but he is tired of finding out the alternative solutions from the complex problem of doing that .
He was efficient in making the ideas realized by rays .
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the work of enveloping India in a source .
This can be brought in the shadow of a nation and a comprehensive convention to the most important Indians .
He will be able to overcome all the difficulties in his decision .
Wherever we need to be honored, we've been honored.
Wherever there was a need to use the bull , where they used the bull .
He became a definite calculation and with that point he was guided firmly .
Keeping the country together the work could only do that .
They saw such a national dream, where all the logs would be equal.
I feel as if the idea of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is always inspiring .
They used to say , we can not stop any distinction of tribes , all of India ' s children and daughters , we should love the country and the future should be on each other 's love and harmony .
This idea of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring for the vision of our New India , appropriate .
And their birthday is celebrated as ' national unity day ' .
All of us are inclined that we also participate in this festival of our goodwill .
Beloved Deshbandhano , after Diwali holiday , along with the new composition , we have come all in our daily life with new determination .
My sword shall be fulfilled all their dreams , and such a miracle .
Very blessings.
My dear countrymen, we're all bowing down
Three years have been completed by talking about the mind through the sky .
Today this is 36th part .
Most of them are inspiring me .
Many things are to improve the government .
Some individual complaints also occur .
Otherwise some communicable questions are made to take care of and I take half an hour from the month , but people keep sending their things to the mother of the third day .
The result of this is that sensitivity has also come in the government .
Now ignoring the imagined capacity of the entire level of the society , it is feeling very easy and therefore this three year journey of Man Ki Baat is a flaming journey of feelings , feelings of the countrymen .
Perhaps in such a short time I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country and for that I am very beloved of the countrymen .
In ' Mon Ki Baat ' I have always kept in mind one thing of Acharya Vinoba Bhave .
Acharya Vinoba always used to say , ' A-governmental , non-governmental ' is the result of madness .
This thing has been kept away from the state colors . At that time instead of flowing in the matter of which there is an alarm , a stable mind has tried to stay attached to it .
Now three years later , I know that social research , university , researcher , technologist will definitely analyze it .
In comparison to all such things more and more I believe that the ideas done by such a simultaneously will prove to be more useful for the swearing of mind ' in future .
I once told in ' Men Ki Baat ' that it is important to worry about the food being used as much as we should not go on eating .
After this I saw , from the corners of the country I was caught in a large number .
Many social organizations , many youths are already working on this .
I remember how many people working for this can be used by mixing those foods which are given in the tamarind .
Once I saw this thing as well as the Dr . Selfie with a Sarpanch of Haryana and told them all in the mother 's mother ' .
Seeing , not only in India but also in the whole world such a huge crowd has started .
This is not just a problem of social media .
Every one has become a new self-confidence, a new glorious event.
A few days back I used to discuss with the tourism department of the Government of India .
I told the people going out , wherever you go on the subject of ' unbalanced India ' , wherever you go , there have been photographs .
It has come from every corner of India , in a way it is a big stop for the working people in the tourist area .
I felt as if a small incident could create a big slope , because of its slope of mind ' .
The mother of the mind started three years , I was thinking about this today , at that time many incidents of last three years have touched my mind .
Every moment the country is being considered to go through the right path .
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for good things of society , for the progress of the country .
In the campaign of this three year old man I have understood the countrymen , learned from them .
I bow down to the countrymen completely from the heart .
I had once talked about Khadi in the mother-in-law . Khadi is not a cloth but it is said to be a thought .
I want to inspire once again , let us continue the campaign of Khadi which has started .
If we buy khadi then we will have to work in the poor house with this sense of lightning .
The poor people of our country get strength from this work and therefore we should do this work .
How can the new technology be brought, how can the production capacity be increased, how can the handsome power be brought on the solar energy
The idea of the old 200-20 , 25-25 , 30-30 years has been closed , what can be revived now .
In Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh now Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years but now it has been revived .
Since then many organizations have been connected .
Many people have been provided new opportunities of employment .
Here amidst Kashmir , Khadi and Village programs started their training centers closed once again and towards Kashmir there is a lot to contribute in this area .
Now because of the resumption of this training centres new generations will get big help in creating modern methods , clothing , new things in it . I feel very good because of this , the time when big corporate houses give gifts , at that time they have started giving khadi things .
People have also started giving things of khadi while meeting each other .
Cleanliness will connect the people and mind .
Our respected patriotismji started this work and the entire country was involved in Tenz .
Woman , males , men , women , cities , everybody has become a part of this cleaning point today .
The time I say , ' Siddhi from Sankalp ' now we are seeing how this cleanness is moving forward towards a composition - principle .
Everyone accepts this movement , helps and gives some or the other contribution to realize it .
I consider the honor of respectable patriotism .
But along with this every section of the country has considered it its work .
I consider such things good and the thing of happiness for me is that in the first four days in this campaign more than 75 lakh people joined the program and I have seen that some people are working seventy times , the right results have been determined to stay working till this time .
One thing is that we have to clean somewhere , the other thing is that we do not make unsuccessful by staying aware , but if we have to make cleanliness then there is also a need for a ideological movement .
During this time along with the campaign of this service , many competitions have been made .
More than two and a half crore children participated in the bondage competition on this subject of cleanliness .
Thousands of children picked up pictures.
Using our imagination we took pictures on the subject of cleanliness .
Many people wrote poems and in these days the pictures that I have sent by my child members , small boys , they post in social media .
At the time when the matter of cleanliness comes , at that time I never forget to accept the shelter of the people of the media .
These people have taken this movement forward in a very good way .
They are also under the leadership of this clean movement in their own way .
Through electronic media in our country , how much of the country can be served through printed media , we can see this vividness in the ' movement ' of service .
Recently someday before me somebody had taken care of the information about the 18 year old young man Bilal Dar of Srinagar .
No , nothing like that .
Bilal Dar works as cleansing for five-six years from the age of 12-13 years .
The biggest pond in Asia is near Srinagar , in this pond there is plastic , polythene , used bottles , garbage , dirt , it cleanses the pond after removing everything .
Bilal Dar is younger than age , but it has become an inspiration from every point of view that is interested in cleanliness .
I enjoy Bilal Dar very much .
O my dear countrymen , we should accept this thing that future history is born from the womb of history and at that time it is very natural to remember the great men at that time when the subject of history comes out .
This is the month of October to remember many great men .
There is a Jayanti of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2 October . Jayaprakash is the Jayanti of Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on 1 October and the Jayanti of the Dindayal Upadhya Pandit on 25 September .
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Dindayalji .
Or what would be a center-bind of all the great men
Nanaji Deshmukh quit the royal life and stayed in the work of the village and at the time when his centuries are celebrated today , at that time it is very natural to feel respect for the work of his villagers .
The time when the Maji President of India Shriman Abdul Kalamji was condolences with the newborns , at that time Nanaji used to always speak about the rural development of Deshmukh .
With great respect he used to mention the work of Nanaji , his work and he also went to the villages to see the work of Nanaji .
Like Mahatma Gandhi , Dindayal Upadhyaji was speaking about the human being at the end of the society .
Sardar Saheb had brought the whole country together .
Now we should also run for unity and mantra of unity ahead .
We call people very easily , naturally , specialty of unity in diversity .
We glorify the diversity , but have we ever tried to experience this variety
I want to repeat my countrymen of India , especially I want to tell my youth , we are in a strange state .
The summer holiday is , the day of Diwali , it is possible to go out somewhere or the other in our country .
People go out as tourists and they are very natural .
But sometimes it seems to be a matter of concern , our people do not see our country , they do not know the variety of countries .
You must go to the outside country , I do not protest against it , but sometimes you should also see the places in your country .
If Mahatma Gandhi , Lokmanya Tilak , Swami Vivekananda , his Maji President Abdul Kalamji ' s life then one thing can be remembered again , that is , when all of them visited India , at that time he was brought to India and at that time he had to live for India or to give life to the country such a new inspiration was found .
All these great men had done extensive tour of India .
At the beginning of his work he tried to understand , understand India .
The departure of tourism will happen at the same time when we do not go only in the form of childhood , go as a student and try to understand their life .
In more than four and a half hundred districts I have also got a chance to stay at night and at the same time when I take care of this big responsibility in India , then the experience of misery done at that time is very beneficial .
It does not take time at all .
You are my master to all that unity in this variety of India is not just a declaration , but a grandeur of our immense power .
There are many types of food habits towards us .
If we keep eating a new thing everyday in the entire life then there are so many types that the first thing does not come again .
Now , this is a big strength of our tourism .
I am convinced that even if you go out somewhere at this time you are going to move ahead with my first campaign .
You must send photographs on ' Hashtag Incredible India ' .
If you met the people there then send their photographs .
There is a thought in my mind that in order to encourage tourism in India what can happen to the seven best tourist places in our state every Indian should be aware of those seven special places in our state .
If possible they should go to that seven place .
Can we know anything about these places
Can we provide this information on Narendra Modi App
Can we know this on Hashtag incredibly India
If you think , if all the people in a state start to know such a good thing then I tell the government , take care of the information that has come and prepare a circular literature about what seven things have come from each state .
This means how can it be encouraged to tourism places in a way through the means of population
Government of India will work on it .
Or, join me.
You can also become a big , important partner to encourage the tourism of the country using this period from October month to March .
For this I am inviting us .
Many things touch my mind as my loved countrymen , as a human .
The waves rise in my mind .
Some things on my mind get upset .
In the end I am a human like myself .
Indian Lashkar has got two virgins in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi .
As a matter of fact , the husband of both autonomy and funds had become impotent while serving the Mother India .
We can imagine , what is the situation of mind if the world is destroyed in such a small age .
But the wife of Shahid Karnal Santosh Mahadik , Swati Mahadik , while embracing this difficult situation , decided in the mind and became full of the Indian army .
After doing hard work for 11 months he completed his training and to fulfil his father ' s dream he put his life .
Similarly Nidhi Dubey , his president Mukesh Dubey was acting as a hero in Lashkar and became a martyr for the motherland .
But his wife Nidhi determined that we would be filled with the army and they completed the determination .
It is natural for every countrymen to feel respectful about their mother - power , these virgins .
I enjoy both these bugyals very much from the heart .
My dear countrymen , the festival of Navaratri and the festival of Diwali in the middle of this period there has been a big opportunity for the youth study of the country .
Under the 17th year FIFA world class competition is taking place in our country this year .
I am sure you will have to hear the blow of football all around .
The interest of football in each group will be increased .
In the fields of schools , colleges of Hindustan their newborns have not been seen playing , it will not be possible .
Let us go to play on the whole world 's land , then we will also make the game part of our life .
My dear countrymen , the festival of Navaratri is going on .
There is a time of worship of Mother Durga .
How the entire environment has been weighed with holy fragrance .
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the other hand when the whole country used to celebrate festivals then on the other hand from any part of India it is natural to worry about the country , this is the country of our country Buddha and Gandhi .
The country of Sardar Patel bringing their lives to the listening of the country .
Our ancestors have accepted the social life children , non-violences , equally respectfully .
We have heard ' non-violence paramo religion ' since childhood .
I had also said after reddening that violence would not be consumed on the name of faith , even if it is faith in communal faith or political ideology , even if there is faith in the person , even if there is faith in tradition , there is no right to take in the name of faith in the name of faith .
I want to give assurance to the countrymen whether they are those people who take the right hand , guide the humor , or groups , this country will never endure and no government will endure .
Everyone has to bow in front of the righteousness .
Because of being a cultural tradition of thousands of years , seeing cultural tradition , social tradition , historical events , perhaps in 365 days there would be no relief of the same day which would remain without conciliation .
Now we have seen this that our numbers continue according to the nature chakra .
There is direct relation with nature .
Most of our numbers are connected to the fields .
Then first of all I want to call us ' Mishtami Dukdam ' .
During the Jain society the festival of Samvatsari was celebrated .
In Jain society in the month of Bhadras mountains are celebrated .
On the last day of the festival of monsoon the day of sanctuary is held .
This is a unique tradition .
The day of monsoon , the symbol of efficiency , non-violence and friendship .
This is also a tradition of calling each other a sweet day .
We have heard this discussion and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say - this is the speciality of a strong man .
In his play , Shakespeare has written the significance of efficiency in the Marcy of Venice .
My beloved countrymen , at present Ganesha - Chaturthi is being celebrated with great joy in the corners of the country .
When the topic of Ganesha - Chaturthi comes then it is natural to speak on the public Ganeshotsav .
The credit of Ganesha - Chaturthi goes on for ten days .
This Mahasana is considered to be a symbol of unity , equality and identity .
The horrific splendor of the Ganeshotsav for the construction of all the countries .
This festival has been celebrated in Kerala in recent years .
One of the various species of India is the main source of Kerala .
This quality is known because of its social and cultural importance .
Nowadays this is seen to be the reason for the tourism attraction .
I will tell the countrymen as if the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way .
At the same time there is a chance to attract other foreigners .
In that direction we have to consider what we can do .
This festival will be celebrated all over the country in the series of shining days .
The horrific splendor of ' Id-ul-uha ' of all the countrymen .
Census is the symbol of faith and faith for us .
The constituents of our new India have to make a symbol of cleanliness .
In family life many are connected with cleanliness .
Preparation of science means - cleanliness is not even a new thing for us .
But it is necessary to have a social nature .
The goal of cleanliness in public is not only home but also in the entire village , in the entire city , in our state , in our country , in our country and in our country , to become an incomplete part .
My dear countrymen , the interpretation of being modern is changing .
This is a big campaign of ' Friendly Ganpati ' .
If you see the tube then the child of every house is making Ganapati .
Somebody is colouring vegetables , some are teasing the pieces of paper .
Different kinds of uses are happening in every family .
And nausea occurs when new and new uses are known .
Three years ago, when the cleaning operation was started, it would be three years on October 2.
Its positive results are visible .
The toilet has reached around 67 kitchens from 39 percent .
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from toilet on opening .
A few days back there was a terrible supplement in Gujarat .
Many people lost their lives but when the water of Pura decreased then dirt was spread everywhere .
At the same time the workers of Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera of Banaskanta district of Gujarat cleaned the two temples and 3 mosques respectively .
Sweat on its own , all the people came out .
Excellent examples of unity for cleanliness , examples of inspiration to everyone , have been given by all the workers of Ulema-e-Hind .
Having made an attempt to dedicate for cleanliness . If this becomes our permanent feeling then our country can go somewhere .
My beloved countrymen , I advise everyone that once again on 2 October Gandhi Jayanti 's 15-20 days ago , ' Cleanliness of this service ' like ' Water Service ' , ' Cleanliness of this service ' .
Make environment of cleanliness in the entire country .
As soon as you get the opportunity , when you get , we should find the opportunity .
But we all come together.
Come together on the day of holiday or on Sunday and work together .
Going to the nearby cloth but work with a movement .
I guide all the NGOs , schools , colleges , social , cultural political leaderships to government officials , artists , sarpanchs everybody that 15 days before October 2 Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti we will become an environment of unsuccessful cleanliness .
Ministry of Drinking Water and Cleanliness, MyGov.
A department has been built on IN where after the construction of the toilet you can write your name and the name of that family which you have helped .
My friends of Soshal Midia can run some constructive campaigns and actually work on the Earth of the world can become its inspiration .
This campaign by the Ministry of Switched Competition , Drinking Water and Cleanliness of Switchen Competition , Small Film making Competition , Picture Competition is being organised .
In this we can write bonds in different languages and there is no bond of age in it .
You can make small pictures by your mobile .
A film of 2 . minutes can be made that life will inspire for cleansing .
It can happen in any language .
I invite everyone to join this cleaning mission .
I want to tell again once again that at this time on 2 October Gandhi Jayanti should conclude to celebrate ' Swachh 2 October ' and for this the cleaning of this mantra should be reached home from 15th September itself .
For cleanliness we lifted some or the other steps .
Exercise yourself and take part of it .
You see how Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2 October.
You can imagine that during this cleaning campaign of 15 days when Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated on 2 October , then you will be happy to give devotion to the worshippers .
My dear countrymen , I want to accept my moments specially today .
I express my glory from within the heart , not because we have been associated with the mother of the mind for a long time . I want to express our grief for this , I want to accept the moment that through the ' Mon Ki Baat ' program crores of people are being linked to the country .
I get an opportunity to understand the feeling of the mind of the people of the country .
As much as you see the mother of the mind as I wait for my message .
I am inspired because I get to learn something from every thing of yours .
In order to think newly about the whole thing my small things come into use and therefore I express my respect towards my contribution .
We are contacting our mobile phones and we become part of such wrong habits .
Prime Minister , I speak aparna from Pune .
I want to tell about my friend he often tried to help people but I was stunned to see a habit of it .
I once went to shopping mall with it .
We pay a payment without any feeling at large places , but we struggle with our hard work shows unbelief on them .
Does not you feel that there is always a relationship with some things that sell , small shopkeepers , vegetable sellers near your house , when we come in contact with the troublers , we feel goods with them .
Not only this , we talk about reducing two - five rupees and we went to eat in a big hotel that the bill does not even see , pay it .
There is no question of money for him , how many ailments are happening to his heart .
He is poor therefore with doubt about his honesty you do not have any difference in your life with two - five rupees but how big does this little habit of yours give him a shock
Madame is my beloved and we have given me a message by making a phone call touching the heart .
I believe that my countrymen will also leave such behavior with the poor .
My beloved newborn friends , on 29 August the whole country is celebrating national sports day .
This is the birth day of great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchandji .
His contribution to hockey is incomparable .
I want to do this thing for memorizing that I feel that we should join new generations of games in our country .
Sports should become part of our life .
If we are young countries of the world then youths of our country should be seen in the field of games .
Krida means physical temperament , intellectual temperament , emotional co - operation .
I understand what should be more than this .
Sports is a way of connecting the heart .
Our youth will go ahead in the field of sports , today in the age of computer I want to tell us that the area of Krida is more important than the sports stations .
Play fifa games on computer but show some work on the outer field .
The joy of playing cricket in the open field is different from the cricket of computer .
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out then I thought you were synonymous at home .
Today the situation is such that when the children come home they see games or cartoon films on mobile while sitting in the copies then you have to think that you are sometimes wizardous outside .
This was the time when you asked the mother to tell the child sometimes this time has come that you will never be aware of the child .
It is a belief of happiness to our youth that in 6 to 28 October 17 years of age fifa world camp is being organised .
Today I used to talk about sports , in the last week there was an incident that touched my mind which I want to tell the citizens .
I got an opportunity to see girls of a young age some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Sometimes 30 - 30 days have been spent in water . In the waves of the sea Himmati or six daughters . This would be the first incident of the world .
Who is Indian who does not feel proud of such girls
I salute Himmati of these girls and let them say this experience to all the people of the country .
I am also presenting a different place for their feelings on the Narendra Modi Pass .
Because we must read their experience because it is a kind of adventurous story , story of sensitivity and I will be happy to reach the point of girls , my girls are very happy and blessed .
On 5th September we celebrate all the teaching days of my dear countrymen .
The birth day of the past patriot Dr . Radhakrishnanji of our country is .
He was president but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He often likes to wake up as a teacher .
Awakening the joy of creative emotion and knowledge among our students is an important quality of the teacher .
At this time when we celebrate the teaching day we can compose a composition together .
Bring each one with a composition for five years , show the way to prove it and after five years we will be able to enjoy life successfully taking the pleasure of Sankalp fulfillment .
There is such an incident in the life of every teacher that by his efforts somebody has changed due to change in life .
If we make a collective attempt then we can play a major role in the change of the nation .
I stay in Mumbai working for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University .
Thank you.
My beloved countrymen , Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana economic intuition is the subject of the church of the Pundits of not only India but also of the whole world .
On 28 August , 2014 the plan was started with a dream in the mind .
Therefore this program is being completed for 3 years .
30 crore new families have been connected , the bank has been expelled .
Today I am enjoying that the poor people of the society have been made the history of the economy of the country .
Now a situation of restraint has been formed .
He feels that money will come to the forefront of children .
Some good works can be done in the second time of Yana .
Not only this , the poor who see Rupay Card in their mission feels like Mrs . . This is the credit card , in my opinion Rupay card .
So he feels a happy experience.
Under the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana 65 thousand crore rupees are deposited in the bank , this is a way saving the poor .
This is their strength in the second stage and in the Prime Minister 's Reproductive Plan , whose eatings have been opened , its Vima has also been descended .
Today great faith has been created in the poor due to this mamauli weekend of ' Prime Minister Life Jyoti Vima Yojana ' one rupee , thirty rupees .
Because of the difference of one rupee in many families if something has happened on the main basis of the family then his family will get two lakh rupees .
Today there is no such time but I tell the people of the bank that upload my gov . in .
My dear countrymen, we're silly again.
Very nice.
The mind of the person is such that in the rainy season he feels very charming .
Pashu , birds , trees , nature - all becomes happy with the arrival of rains .
Only this rain sometimes takes a rare form and then it feels that there is such a big power to bring destruction in water .
Nature gives us life , gives us our reproduction , but sometimes its physical form seen in natural dangers like sufficient , earthquake proves to be extremely harmful .
Whatever changes are happening in changing seasonal and environment their very big negative effects are also happening .
In the past few days in some parts of India especially in Assam , northeastern states , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal some parts are facing natural problems due to excessive increase .
Complete care is being taken on the supplied areas .
According to the Government of India the soldiers of the army , the people of the air services , the people of NDRF , the folk associations , the folk groups , all these times swim automatically in the hands of the terrorists .
Its effect is seen on fields , rehabilitation , infrastructure , roads , vigilance , means of contact .
People are also telling their problems .
Gradually we can also make our work as a result of the weather , by which possible losses can be prevented .
When I prepare the ' Mon Ki Baat ' then I see the citizens of the country making more preparations for it than me .
This time I have come a lot of time on the subject of GST , many phone calls have come and even more people are expressing happiness about GST , alongside they are also expressing utmostness .
In it a phone call will also tell you . Namaskar , Pantprahan ji , I speak Nitu Garg from Gurgaon .
I heard the words of your honorary writer daily and got very impressed .
Similarly in our country the beginning of GST was done by doing goods and services to the same star of the last month .
What can we tell whether the government had asked for this decision and whether the results are getting one month later or not
I want to hear your thoughts about this .
GST has been implemented for almost a month and its benefits have also been seen .
When a poor person writes me a portrayal about how the price of the essential things of the poor has decreased , how the things have become cheap then I feel very satisfied .
What kind of expression of GST was scared initially , but now it seems as easy to learn about it as much as it seems that some person living in the jungles in the remote mountains of Ishaanya .
All these facilities are there but in order to maintain economic speed also its reading is available .
The speed in which this change has been done easily , the fast that it has been transferred has become a newly recorded environment of faith in the whole country .
The use of GST of India in the form of an ideal system sometimes in front of the world by making a detailed amendment in the field of scholar , systemic field of science .
For many students of the world it will become an example , a hairstone .
Because there has been such a big change in such a large quantity and it is a big jump of success to implement it in such a large country with the participation of millions of people .
All the decisions have been taken together by the States and the Central Government .
Consequently every government has asked more importance , because of GST there is no excessive burden on the expenditure of poor food grains .
What was the price of something before GST , what is the price of it in the new situation , all the information is available on the GST app of mobile it is well known to you .
I am very happy with the minds of all the ministries , all the departments , central and state government workers for this work .
GST is an excellent example of the victory of India 's strategic powers .
This is a new historic victory .
And this is not just a compassion but a new authentic culture .
There is also a possibility of social improvement in one way .
I once again enjoy Koti Koti - Koti dwellers with regard to losing such big work easily .
My dear countrymen , this month of August is the month of revolution .
In a similar way in the month of August many such incidents have happened which are associated with the history of freedom .
This year we're celebrating uit India Movement or 75th anniversary of the movement.
Only very few people will know about the story that Dr. Nara.
Yusuf Meher Ali had given it.
It is necessary to know what happened on 9 August 1942 .
What can be a bigger inspiration than that
The 'Bharat Choo Movement ' was an important union of Indian freedom struggle .
This movement had prepared the entire country to take the chances of being free from British royalty .
This was the only time when India became part of the movement by snatching the Indian masses in the royalties of the British , every corners of India , villages , cities , cities , cities , uneducated , uneducated , poor , even though , Shrimant , everybody .
Millions of Indians giving revenge to Mahatma Gandhi 's adventurousness were swinging in their life association with ' Karo or Maro ' mantra .
Millions of young men of the country had left their education , was simple towards the books .
The main role of great men like Rhino , Jaiprakash Narayan was impossible .
At the same time Gandhiji 's two different forms are seen in both the events of ' hierarchy movement ' and ' Bharat Chodo movement ' - 1920 and 1942 .
Together the form of movement was separated and in the year 42 such a situation came , the rapidity grew so much that great men like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of ' Karo or Maro ' .
There is public support behind all these successes , people were successful , people were peaceful , people were peaceful .
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I feel , if you see the leaves of history adding a little then the first freedom fight of India was established in 1857 .
This fight of freedom started from 1857 continued every moment in some part of the country till 1942 .
This long-term period awakened the sense of freedom in the minds of the people of the country .
Everybody was committed to doing something or the other towards that side .
Read changes , but the composition does not deteriorate .
People came , joined , went out , new people came and the country was making every effort to overthrow the royalty of the British .
It was decisive for five years.
Now I want to join you or mathematics.
In 1947, we fell independent.
Today 2017 years is going on .
That knee took about 70 years .
During the period the government came and went .
Arrangements have been made , changed , washed , increased .
Everyone tried in their own way to get rid of the problem of the country .
In order to increase employment in the country , to overcome poverty , efforts have been made to develop .
In the same way pain has also been felt for him .
I've got success.
Heightened even more.
Like from 1942 to 1947 it was five years of Sankalp Sedition .
Similarly , I see that the five-year period of the journey of Sankalp Siddhi from 2017 to 2022 is now in front of us .
On 15 August of 2001 this was celebrated as Sankalp Parva and when we completed 75 years of independence in 2022 then that composition was fulfilled .
Today not only the declaration of ' Karenge ' , but also to join this composition of new India , to join this work , to achieve success by breaking down .
This complication has to be acquainted with carelessness , fighting .
Let us run an epic from Sankalp to its achievement on 9 August in the month of August of Yand .
Each Indian , social organization , local instrument , school , colleges , different organizations - everybody has to make some or the other new plans for the newborn .
Such a composition which we will prove to be in the next five years .
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We become part of this project , today we are more or not online .
That is why I offer this invitation to my young friends living in the online world today in the formation of a new India they will go forward to contribute in their delicate way .
Using technology take all such things as video , post , blog , jewelry , new complications .
Give this opportunity the form of a mass movement .
Narendramodi App too uit India uiz ' is being started for young friends .
This question of India 's salvation is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the leaders of freedom fighters .
I believe that you will spread and spread it in a wide range .
As my dear countrymen , on 15th August , as the chief servant of the country I get an opportunity to contact the country from the Red Fort .
I am only incomplete .
Definitely send your views on MyGov or NarendramodiApp.
I read it myself and try to ask for this idea in the time I get on 15th August .
Last three times I heard a complaint about my 15 August languages that my speech was just a little longer .
I will finish it in more than 40-45-50 minutes .
There is a social economy in India 's economy .
And that economy is never going to be less written .
It is not just a matter of joy , fun , fun .
Your festivals , their quality are also the medium of social reform .
But at the same time every one has a direct relation with the economic world of the poor .
In a few days only , Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , afterwards Ganeshotsav , afterwards fourth moon , afterwards Anant Chaturdashi , Durga Puja , Dwali together , one , one gain is coming and this is the time when the poor get an opportunity to connect their meaning .
And it also mixes a simple natural pleasure in these qualities .
And if we have to say about economics then hundreds of families start making treasures through small domestic industries several months before the sale of saffron .
From Khadi to the silky slopes you do not know how many kinds of sheep are formed and nowadays people have started giving more likes to homemade , household cheeks .
The business of thousands and thousands of people is connected to the business of making serpents , selling serpents , sweets .
Its direct relation is with the poor family making small dunes of earth .
But as soon as we talk about the economy of the poor connected with census and census , I want to get the problem of environment .
And they have warned me that in the context of Ganeshotsav I should also speak about the environment i . . Eco - Friendly Ganesha idols beforehand so that people can see the idol of earth being chosen from now on .
I am the beloved of this aware citizens first .
They only warned me that I should first demand this topic.
This year the public Ganesh festival has a special importance .
And when I tell this thing a long time , then you are waiting for this contact with all this composition .
And the poor workers who make this idol will get employment to the poor artists , the poor will fill their stomach .
Or we should connect our festivals with the poor or connect with the economy of the poor , make the happiness of our values a value of the economic benefit of the poor house , enjoy them from the joy or attainment of economic availability , or from the point of view we all want to try .
I wish all the countrymen a lot of pleasure for the festivals .
Our countrymen feel proud of our girls , feels respectful .
Just a few days back our girls demonstrated their playing worldwide cricket .
I got the opportunity to visit all those players in the same week .
It was very good to speak to them , but I realized that there was a lot of harm to the worldwide zincity on their minds .
It was seen bursting , tension on their skin .
I told them a different analysis of mine .
I said . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It is so increased that when success is not achieved then that symptom turns into aspiration .
We have seen many such games in which if the players of India become ineffective then the anger of the country appears on those players .
Some people speak such things leaving their limits , write such things which are very painful .
But this was the first time that even though our girls did not get the world classics alive , the hundreds of crores of citizens of the country took the burden of that defeat on their shoulders .
In reality young girls of our country , especially their daughters are doing a lot to glow the name of our country .
I once again enjoy the youth of the country , especially the mind of our girls very much .
Every countrymen should commend and every countrymen should advise the campaign to prove that complication in the next five years .
Come on, let us come together and wait for the next time or keep doing something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namskar.
Climate is getting worse .
Year summers also become very fast .
Only , but let us know , the monsoon rains have occurred on time and its next trend is starting .
In many parts of the country due to freezing rains there is a pleasant environment .
After rainy season due to heavy rains in the last few days we got a gift from the heat of the sun .
And we have seen all this that whatever range in life , whatever stress , whatever physical life , whatever public life , the arrival of rain changes your mind .
The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated in many parts of the country with great faith and enthusiasm today .
Now in some parts of the world also the festival of the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated .
Lord Jagannathji is connected to the poor in the country .
Those who do .
Babasaheb Ambedkar has been studied , he must have seen that he used to praise the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannathji , because social justice , social harmony in him .
The holy month of Ramzan is celebrated with the holy feelings of the best faith .
Now there is a measure of Eid .
Id-ul-Fitrha is a very good pleasure of everyone from me .
Ramzan month is the month of donating Pune .
There is a month of enjoyment and as much enjoyment as you want .
Come on , let us seem to be a treasure of joy by taking inspiration from all these holy moments , or let us go ahead to the country .
In this holy month of Ramzan the most inspiring incident of the Mubarakpur village of Bijnor of Uttar Pradesh came to me .
The families of nearly three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village , in a way the population of the brothers and sisters of our Muslim families is more there .
During this Ramadan the villagers have decided to build a toilet together .
This personal toilet also gets help from the government and under this assistance about 17 lakh rupees have been given to them .
This is 17 lakh rupees which you spend for other facilities in the village .
I enjoy all the rural places of Mubarakpur in regard to this sacred dinouncement of society in the context of welfare .
One thing of them is also very inspiring .
And the most important thing is that they made Mubarakpur free of harmony .
We know that Sikkim , Himachal and Kerala in our country have already been declared to be harmless beforehand .
In this week Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared as harmless .
I consider the administration of these five states , the government and the people to be specially aware of the fulfillment of this work .
Then somewhere the body , mind of the body becomes tired .
The subject of cleanliness is also like this .
This bad habit has become part of our nature .
We have become part of our habits .
In order to get rid of this we will have to try regularly .
Everybody has to take care of it .
The best inspirational events will have to be remembered again and again .
And I feel happy that cleanliness is no longer a government program .
It is becoming the symptoms of the common man of the society .
And the people sitting in the government also do this work from the public side , then its strength increases several times .
Just recently, an excellent incident came to me, I would like to tell you.
This incident is of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh .
The administration there took a very big job from the public side .
100 hours of tireless campaign.
And what happens to the point .
Build toilets in 10 thousand houses in 71 gram panchayats in 100 hours .
And my beloved countrymen , you will be happy to hear that together with the people and administration the work of making 10 thousand toilets in 100 hours is successful .
71 villages became horrors free.
I enjoy the citizens of that village of the people settled in the government , most of the government and Vijayanagaram district very much , they have kept in front of an extremely inspiring example with tireless hard work .
His awareness towards the publicity of Prakash Tripathi is very curiosity .
And publicity is a system but it is also a culture .
The awareness of the intuition is the price of its freedom .
Public awareness is necessary regularly and therefore also used to remember the babes who were hurting the public state and used to guide ahead towards the good babe of the public state .
1975 - 25 June was such a time when no folk lover could forget .
No Indian resident will be able to forget .
In a way transformation of country was done in Turanga .
The opponent's solar was pressed.
With Jaiprakash Narayan the dignitaries of the country are being drowned in Turanga .
Even the youth could not escape from that horrific shadow of crisis .
It was possible to make clothing completely unprotected .
Today students , people working in public work are constantly trying to increase public awareness by repeated memory of that black block and keep doing it .
At that time Atalbehari was also in swimming .
When we saw Lahibani for a year , Atalji had written a poem and he described the mindset of that place as his poetry .
My dear countrymen , the value of every Indian has been raised in the world today .
21 June 2017 - the whole world was celebrated Yoga .
From the sea to the mountains people call the rays of the sun in the morning through welcome yoga .
There is no Indian who does not seem to have any respect of it .
It is not possible that there was no yoga exercise earlier , only today when yoga has been built in the thread of yoga , Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world .
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity of yoga .
The  Great Walk of China ' of China people have done yoga here , then Peru has done yogasana at a height of 2400 metres from the sea level at the Machu - Picchu world heritage site here .
People practiced yoga in the shadow of the Aiffel tower in France .
In Afghanistan , here in Herat , India gave a different dimension to the friendship of India by making yoga on Afghan friendship dam i . . Salma dam .
Yoga class has been organised with Yoga Masters at the headquarters of the United Nations .
In Gujarat about 55 thousand people from Ahmedabad registered a new world sale by doing yogasana at the same time .
I also got an opportunity to join the yoga program here .
And for the first time only I would be benefitted by doing yogasana in rain .
Where our people used to take 20 , 25 , 40 degrees temperature , they also practiced yoga between Siachen .
Your armed team , border security team , ITBP , CRPF , everybody has made Yogasanas their own association with their work .
This yoga day I used to say that three generations , because this is the third international yoga day , therefore I used to say that the three generations of the family together send me their photographs while doing yoga .
Some filmmakers also took up this issue .
I got many photographs related to this , some of the selected photographs have been collected on Narendramodi App .
A few days back I got an opportunity to go to my most interesting program .
The nearest railway station from Karipur International Airport is Karipur International Airport .
N.
A good program is organised in Panikar presidency , and people will take the habit of reading books , to be aware of reading public books , to celebrate reading day and reading month .
Now the thing that I had also been neglected in my mind , recall it .
Because when I was in Gujarat then I had made a tradition in the government that if we do not want to give flowers , then we would welcome it only by giving a book or handloom .
Even then the handicraft of khadi , so that the khadi will get to run .
When I was in Gujarat , the habit of all of us was made only after coming here my habit was lost .
Only went to Kerala and once again that habit became aware .
And now I have started giving information to the lower people again in the government .
We can also gradually make nature .
The life of flowers was very less .
Once it is taken in hand that it is kept back .
If the book is visible then in a way it becomes part of the house , becomes part of the family .
When I am telling this thing then how historical things would have been there .
When I went to England last year , British ueen Elizabeth invited me to eat .
For how many years Lotli , only ueen Alizabetha has kept the humility given by Mahatma Gandhi .
And when I went , he was showing me very happy .
And when I was watching , their aim was to touch him and see him .
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life , became part of his history .
I am sure that these habits do not change in the night , and whenever they say this then the vaccine has to be rich .
Even then we want to talk about such things , we want to keep trying .
Now if I am not there then I can not say that I went somewhere and if a well gave me a gift of flowers then I would forgive him .
Many kinds of works are done by my beloved countrymen , father-in-law or mother .
There is problem in the files , only I have developed a habit for me that in the letters I come , in which I reside everyday and that is why I get an opportunity to join the normal person .
Various kinds of wheels come out , they write different types of masks .
I'll get to read an asshole right now, I think I must tell you about that.
At a distance of South India 's Tamil Nadu ' s Madurai ' s housewife Aurulmozhi Saranan sent me a patriot .
And what is the role of the parent , then he wrote that in his family he thought of taking some or the other economic program by keeping in mind the education of children etc . so that there is little financial help to the family .
I took money from the bank under the Mudra plan and started working towards repairing it by bringing some goods from the market .
Some people thought , I have registered it on myself , I want to tell the people of the country that you should also get such an opportunity to get E on the internet .
Get GEM , there is a new kind of arrangement .
Those who want to repay the goods , want to sell trees , want to sell kurki , want to send tables , then they can register their name on it .
The people who record it under EEGM see all the departments of the government .
Because of no agents the goods get cheaper .
This Arulmozhi Madamani government has registered the things that they can fulfil at this point point .
And Gammat is such that the utensils they write me are very interesting .
They have written that one time they got money under the Mudra Plan , their business started , what I can fulfil on E - GEM , I wrote its word and I got an order from the Pentagon office .
This was a new batmi for me what would be asked by the Pentagon office .
This is the chance of promoting efficiency .
If Aurulmozhi does not write me letters then very often do not let me know that in the E - GEM arrangement a housewife is working far away , its goods can be bought from the Pentagon office .
This is the strength of the country .
There is transparency in it , there is also efficiency in it , there is also efficiency in it .
Government e-bazarpet-GEM
My desire is that those who have got their wealth to the government in this way they should add themselves more to it .
I feel that this is an excellent example of the Kiman government and the Kamal administration and what is the objective here - the price and minimum smoothness , working capacity and transparency .
My beloved countrymen , on one side we keep an eye on yoga , while on the other hand the success that we have in international science can also be respected .
And this is the speciality of India that if our feet are on the ground for yoga sadhana then our dreams are also to cross the harms of the sky far .
A few days back India has shown a lot in the field of creed and science too .
India is breaking its tail not only on the earth but also on the international level .
Two days back ISRO has launched 30 small sub-divisions along with cartosat-2 helicopters .
And in these sub-divisions apart from India , apart from France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Britain , America , about 14 countries are included .
And due to this small sub-division campaign of India there will be a lot of help in the work of agriculture , in the context of natural hazards .
A few days back we all remember that ISRO used to successfully launch GSAT-19 .
And in the sub-divisions which India has now been launched , it is the most weighty sub-division .
And the clothing in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant .
So you can imagine how much work your scientists have done in the interior area .
On 19th June the Mangal Mohammad completed 1 thousand days .
You all know that when we got a successful place in the room for Mangal Mohammad then this whole time was for 6 months .
The photographs are sending , giving information , scientific information is available , while working for more than the prescribed life .
One thousand days to be completed is an important thing for our international journey for our scientific journey .
Nowadays we are also watching in the area of Crida that the work of our youth is lifting up .
India ' s badmintonpattu Kidambi Srikanth has increased the pride of the country by winning an open competition in India .
I enjoy this victory with the heart of his and his audience .
Drink me a few days ago.
T.
There was an opportunity to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the synthetic track of Usha Skul of Athletics .
As much as we encourage sports , sports activity will also come along .
Sports plays an important role in personality development .
The importance of sports is strange in universal personality development .
There is no dearth of immune players in the country .
If there is juice in playing children in your family then give them a chance .
While lifting them up from the ground one should not make them cover in the room , practice .
They should also practice , even if they can show glowing work , then show only if their life is interested in playing , then school , college , family , nearby people should sacrifice them everybody , encourage them .
Everybody wants to keep dreams for the next alignment.
This year it is difficult to forget the summers .
Only rainy season is seen .
Today , while talking to me the holy month of Ramadan has started .
For the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan I give the people of India and around the world , especially Muslim community the holy glimpse of this holy month .
Peace , spirituality and charity are given great importance in Ramzan .
We are very lucky to India that our ancestors have built such traditions and today India can ignore this thing , we can guess the fact that all the communities in the world are in India .
This is such a country where there are people who believe in God and people who deny God are also .
There are also people who worship the idol and those who oppose the idol worship are also there .
Here every kind of ideology , every kind of worshipping system , every kind of tradition is here . We have done the art of living together .
And in the end religion , sect , sect , ideologist or tradition , these common things give us one message - peace , unity and harmony .
This path of peace , unity and harmony for this holy month of Ramzan will certainly be helpful in the work of the future .
I once again enjoy everyone .
I am very happy to say that outsiders gave me this reaction .
Individually everyone showed me the enthusiasm of telling my mind .
Every thing has not been read to me , everybody 's message has not been heard , so many things have come .
But on looking at these messages on the top some people have tried to learn music according to what they saw , some people try to put their hands on new musicians , some people are trying to learn new things by using yutube .
Some people are learning art , some are learning dances , some are taking drama education .
Some people have written that we have started writing poems now .
Some people are trying to understand nature , to wake up with nature .
I have very much enjoyed these things . I also want to hear you a phone call .
"My brilliant architect.
When I started to escape from the freedom struggle then I realized how much struggle has to be done to give India freedom , how much sacrifice has to be given , how many freedom fighters have embraced for years .
Bhagat Singh , who got a lot in the young age , was very inspired by him .
That is why I am desirous of you to give some instructions to the new generation about this .
I feel joyful that the young girl is interested in knowing about her history , about her freedom fighters , the people who sacrificed sacrifice for this country .
Innumerous great men spent their talent in Turanga for freedom , many youths climbed the bottom of Fashi .
They did not swear and therefore we breathe in independent India today .
We have seen one thing that in the movement of freedom which the great men who used to write the throat in the temporary stage , worked a lot of studies and also sacrificed India 's freedom .
I had gone to Andaman Nicobar a year ago .
We also went to see the cellular jail there .
Today Veer Savarkar is his Jayanti .
Veer Savarkar wrote the book ' my birthplace ' in Turunga .
He wrote poems, writes on the walls.
They were closed in small corner .
How would the wages of freedom have suffocated
When I read this book of Savarkaras ' my birthplace ' then from that only I got the inspiration to see the cellular jail .
There is also a philosophy program which is very inspiring .
There is no such state in Hindustan , there is no single language group of Hindustan in which Kuny has not been able to spend his sympathy in those cellular tunnels in the Turanga of Andaman with the teaching of black money for freedom .
The people of every language speaking , every province , every generation have succumbed to this . Today there is a glimpse of Veer Savarkar .
My dear countrymen , June 5 is the first Monday of the month .
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi would have said many times - One must car about a World One will not see.
It is also our duty to take care of the world which we can not see .
If there is a lot of time then open the windows of the room , open the door , breathe in the fresh air .
When contact comes from those five elements which have formed their body then a new chain gets accumulated in our body , a new energy appears .
All of us have experienced this , but we never take care of it , we do not build it in a dagger , in a dagger .
Then you must see that when you come in contact with your natural condition , there will be a new ideological construction inside you .
And therefore to join the nature of June 5 the world love to become your own love .
We are getting some benefit from our ancestors protecting the environment .
Now if we protect the environment then the next generation will get its benefit .
And undesirably if one candidate sees then it is completely the biggest guide scripture of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago .
Mother Bhumi : Friends of Ahm separation : it is said to us .
In words it is said that what is purity among us is because of earth .
Earth is our mother and we are her son .
If we remind Lord Buddha then one thing is clearly visible that the birth of Mahatma Buddha , the knowledge achieved by him and his Mahaparinirvana this event happened under the tree .
But in modern words it is necessary to embrace it with the chariot of modern tactics .
Through yoga we have joined the world in a source .
The way Yoga connects body , mind , intelligence and soul , in the same way it is bringing together today .
Because of today 's lifestyle , because of running , increasing pockets it is becoming difficult to live without stress .
Even from childhood this stressful mind has been seen to be synonymous .
In such a situation the role of yoga is important in the life of stress free .
Yoga is a means of achieving health and strength .
Yoga is not just exercise .
If one has to walk an interim journey along with the health of body - mind , thought - thought , then it is possible through yoga .
Now two days back I have written a letter to the governments of the world , all the leaders .
I have announced some competitions related to yoga , some detainees have been declared .
Gradually work will go ahead towards that side .
I have received an information and I enjoy this priceless imagination .
There is a very psychological information .
He said that this is the third international yoga day of the sacrifice and therefore you should do such exercise that on this day three generations of the family should do yoga together .
Do yogasanas together and upload photographs of life-to-father , son-daughter and daughter-in-law .
It will be such a beautiful solution of tomorrow , today and tomorrow that Yoga will get a new pellet .
I am admired about this imagination and I also feel as if we had run the moment of selfie and got a very interesting experience that the photographs of three readers together would wake up in the country and around the world .
Where three generations are doing yoga sadhana , you must send a collective photograph of those three generations to Narendramodiap , MyGov .
Time , today and tomorrow are those photographs , which will give an end to the golden future .
I am inviting you .
International yoga day is still a period of three weeks .
In a way it is the movement of the disease resistance health management .
I am inviting you all to join it .
When you gave me the responsibility of your chief servant , when I got the opportunity to speak first from the Red Fort on 15th August , at that time I had spoken about cleanliness .
Since then I have come to know what my journey is going on from different parts of India and what Modi is doing , what Modi is going on , what Modi has done .
The reason for this has come to me a very careful phone and I have thought of what they said .
But I am admiring them about bringing this thing in mind .
This is the phone you heard too.
Namskar Modi ji , I am speaking Naina from Mumbai .
On Modiji TV and Soshal Media I always see that wherever you go , cleanliness is filled a lot .
Whether it is Mumbai , according to your observation people have captured cleanliness in the form of a mission .
The elders are also involved in this but awareness of cleanliness has also come in children .
Small children are seen many times while stopping the roads from dirty .
The cleanliness which you started from the valleys of Kashi has taken the form of an adventure by your inspiration .
You have to say that wherever I go , government machinery works as cleanliness but at the same time even in society it seems to be celebrating the festival of cleanliness .
Five days before I reach there , seven days before , ten days before very much cleaning programs are taken .
Now just a few days back I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat .
A lot of cleanliness is going on there .
But I did not know the relationship between these two things .
But after coming to this phone I thought that this thing is true .
We can imagine how much joy has come to me because of this thing in mind and how many way the country is also looking at these things .
The relation of cleanliness is also connected to my brothers . What else is the matter of happiness for me .
There is a habit of making the rest of the preparations for the reception of the fathers , but cleanliness has become the main thing in them .
This thing is also pleasant for someone who loves cleanliness , is inspirational .
The imagination is very good , but I have to consider it .
It is true to have this movement standing and instead of giving some things , memories , gifts , it is a good thing to give a gift of ammuniot tons of garbage coming out of cleanliness humidity .
It will be the work of such a big humanity .
Once we started considering this garbage as a wealth that many new methods of waste management will come before us .
The youth connected with ' State Up ' will also bring new plans .
With the help of the governments of the states , the Government of India has decided to open a big idea of garbage management with the help of public representatives of the cities .
On 5th June , in about four thousand cities of the world environment there are various kinds of equipments available for collecting dense waste , fluid .
Two types of garbage should be provided , one of them is of green color and the other is blue color .
Two types of garbage are produced - one wet waste and the other dry waste .
These wastes are kept in four thousand cities , we put dry garbage in the blue garbage and wet garbage in the green garbage .
For example the garbage that comes out of the kitchen , then there are vegetables in it , there is restless food , there is a glass of eggs , it is a wet garbage and put it in the garbage of green color .
In other types of garbage there are many things like rubber paper , lice , iron , glass , cloth , plastic , polythene , broken dune , rubber , metal .
I am sure that we develop such a culture , towards cleanliness we have to go every time with new steps then we can fulfil the dreams of cleanliness seen by Gandhiji .
Today I have to mention one thing with pride that even if only one person has determined his mind then he can stand a big mass movement .
Cleanliness is such a thing .
Citizens made a queue of the Versova seashore for about 80-90 weeks continuously . thousands of tonnes of garbage went on and then at some places Versova beach became clean and beautiful .
Or the entire responsibility of work was lifted by Versova Residente Volunteer.
Bandhu Bhaginno today has to tell you one more thing with great joy and I have been told that under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan the ' Riyasi Black ' part of Jammu and Kashmir has become free from Hong Kong .
I am enjoying all the citizens of Riyasi block , the administrators of that place , Jammu and Kashmir with an excellent example .
And I have also been told that the front part of this whole slope was a woman living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir .
He took out the torch mosquitoes there for emotionality , by going from homes , villages he inspired people .
I enjoy those mothers and sisters , enjoy the administrators there who have started making a blank honeymoon free on the land of Jammu and Kashmir .
My dear countrymen , from the last month and later days , from the present utensils , from TV channels , from Soshal media , the workmanship of the present government is taken for 3 years .
Or I see all the process as a very positive sign .
The working period of these three years has been tested on every story .
People of every group of society have analyzed it .
Somewhere in it Kautuk Kelney , Kuni Pathimba has been given , some errors have been registered . I consider all this important thing .
Those people who have given vaccinative and important reactions also consider me as a joy .
If light is put on errors , deficiency then there is a chance to improve it .
For a aware nation , this tour is very important for a magnificent nation .
My beloved countrymen , I am also a common citizen like you and the effect of every good wicket is on me as it will be on the mind of any common citizen .
It feels as if I am talking about things of house sitting in the house , family .
And there are hundreds of such families who have told me by writing this thing .
I am an admirer of Akbar Saheb .
My beloved countrymen , if we meet again then every corner of the country must have reached the rains , the weather will change , the moment of the tests will come , the new student will start life and along with the arrival of rain a new happiness , new aroma .
Come , let us all go ahead with love on nature in such an environment .
I am very happy to all of you .
My dear countryman, Namskar
Like the seeker , the imagination of the people hungry for the society , on the other hand often does not go to the government ' s eyes , the volunteer of such problems is also visible .
Every time the information that comes for the ' heart bat ' , they have a comprehensive analysis in the government .
How many types of information are there , what are the problems , what are the experiences of the people .
Normally it has been found that the nature of man is to give advice to others .
On going to the train , on going to bus , if someone gets cough then immediately come and tell you that you do this .
Giving advice , giving information , it is as if something is in our nature .
Most of the information providers are those people who try to reach me , who actually do something or the other in their life .
For doing anything better they keep trying according to their intelligence , strength , capacity , situation and when this thing comes to mind then I felt that it is not normal information .
Some people also do information because they feel that if these ideas are working there , if other people hear and get it a comprehensive form then many people can get benefit .
And therefore , their natural desire is that it should be mentioned in the mother of the mind , all these things are very positive from my point of view .
I first , most of the informations that are fit , I express my respect towards those people who do something or the other for the society .
Not only this , when I mention something then such things come to mind , then it feels very happy .
During the past some people had informed me in the ' mother-in-law of the mind ' , they expressed concern about the food being used , and I mentioned it .
And when mentioned , then on the NarendramodiApp , how many people from the corners of the country on the mother gow , what did they use innovation to avoid the food that is spoken .
I have never considered , today in our country especially young generations have been working for many years .
Some social organizations are doing this , we have heard this for some years , just in my country the youth have joined this work , it has come to me later .
Many have sent me windows .
There are many places where the bank of the pole is starting .
In the bank of these vessels people collect their own vessels , collect vegetables and those people who are required take them from there .
The patient also gets relief , the eater also does not feel ineffective .
This example of what work is done with the help of society .
Today the month of April is completed , the last day is .
In 1 everyday the establishment of these states of Gujarat and Maharashtra is on the day .
The citizens of these two states are very happy with me .
Both the states have made seven efforts to encourage new peaks of development .
In both the states there has been a contribution in the progress of the country and in every field of great men their lives continue to inspire us and in the memory of these great men the establishment of the state , 2022 , 75 years of independence , we want to make our state , our country , our society , our city , our family to go to the Kutch .
So Sankalp Tudis has planned and should go ahead with the participation of all the citizens .
Nature has also changed all the rules of play .
The heat which remains in our country in May - June has been dragged in the memory of experience in March - April .
And when I used to take information of people on ' mother of mind ' then people have informed about what to do during this summer .
S.
Many such friends of Kartik have expressed concern about birds .
They have said that in viranda , need to keep water on glass and I have seen that small children in the family do this work very interestingly .
Once they came to know that they had to fill it with water that they saw that there was water in the utensils which were kept in the day and they kept watching whether the birds came or not .
We feel that this is going on for them , in reality it is a unique experience of awakening this sensation in the mind of little children .
You also sometimes see a little bit of animals and birds feels a new pleasure .
A few days back from Gujarat Shriyut Jagat Bhai has sent me a book , ' Save the Sparrows ' and in this he has expressed concern about the number of symptoms which are decreasing , only he has done what he tried to protect them in the form of campaign .
Although in our country , animals and birds , nature along with them we have been colored with co - living , even then it is important that you should bury such efforts jointly .
When I was the chief minister in Gujarat then Sayidana Saheb , the religious leader of ' Daudi Bohra Samaj ' had completed a hundred years .
He lived 103 years.
And their own self-esteemed Bohara society had made a big campaign to save sympathy through evil devotion .
I got the opportunity to inaugurate it .
About 52 thousand Burd feeders had distributed them to the world's corners.
He has got a place in the Ginness Book of World Heritage .
Sometimes we are so busy , breast feeding , breast feeding , vegetable , potsman , well also come to our house , only we forget that the days of summer are so much that if you think of drinking water .
Young friends , you also have to ask me something .
Sometimes I feel careful that many of our young people feel fun to spend a comfortable life .
Even parents keep paying attention to them in a preservative condition .
Others are also of other ends , only mostly comfortable conditions are visible .
Now tests have ended and plans have been made to enjoy holidays .
Even after summer holidays , summers it feels slightly alright .
Only I have to say something about how to go to your holiday with a friend .
I want some people to use and tell me .
You use this holiday , I give three discounts , if you do all these then it is a very good thing , try to do some of the three .
New places, new experiences, new councils.
Sometimes seeing some thing on TV or reading in the book or listening to the familiar oneself and feeling that thing , there is a difference of land and harmony in both .
Experiments should be positive , should be coming out of comfortable habit .
We are in middle class family , we are in a happy family .
Sometimes feel that I do not say this again , do it once again .
In the evening time , taking your football , taking a volleyball or taking the literature of any sports go to a poor village .
Sports yourself with those poor children , you see , possibly never got the joy of playing in life or before , you will get it .
When the children living in such a life will get a chance to play with you , you have ever considered how big changes will happen in their life .
And I want to go once and again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary organizations work as service providers .
Sometimes there are extremely hot camps .
Personality is of development , many types of developments are included in it .
At the same time you sometimes feel that you have studied such a summer , have practiced personality development , you reach those people who have not received such a chance and who have learned , learn them .
How to do , you can learn them .
I also regret the concern of these things that the mechanism came to reduce the difference , the mechanism came to finish the limit .
Everyone has become busy on the other side because of technologies .
Today there is a comprehensive age .
Friends , dream of becoming very much in life is good thing , the idea of showing something is good thing , and it is also necessary to do it .
Only this also see that the human substances which are inside us are not bitter anywhere , neither do we go away from human qualities anywhere .
Can you give a little bit of money in cultivation or pellet.
Try to spend time with yourself away from technology .
Teaching some musical folk , learning 5-50 in a new language , Tamil , Tamil , Telugu , Assamese , Bengali , Malayalam , Gujarati , Marathi , Punjabi .
How many types of countries are there and if seen properly then you can find a well or well - learning near you .
If swimming is not possible then learn to swim , take pictures , if good pictures are not coming then try to overthrow only some paper .
The sensation that is inside you must be cleared .
Sometimes small things which we say - we do not want , we want to learn .
You see all these new experiments , this is the cultivation that you will also enjoy and you will not get out of what you have built life in a circle .
Do something of Chakori Baheer , friends .
This is the only chance of making life .
And you think that all the tests have ended , if you learn to live on the new variety of factories then that opportunity will not come .
Then you are obstacle in another problem and therefore I tell you , if you are fond of learning magic then learn the magic of women .
Keep showing your friends and daughters magically .
Try to know something or the other which you do not know , it will definitely benefit you .
You will get to take care of human strength inside you will become a very good opportunity for development .
I tell you from my experience how much we can understand learning by looking at the world which we can not imagine .
New places, new towns, new towns, new villages, new campuses.
After going to one place stay for three , four days .
Then go to another place, stay there three days, four days.
You will get to learn a lot from this.
When you go then definitely send me the photo there .
Have you seen new
Where do you go
You can tell your experience by using hashtag incredibly India .
Mitrano , this time the Indian government has also given you a lot of opportunity .
Newly developed people are almost free from obstacles .
You can also earn only by this program - you have thought .
There is a plan of the Government of India .
If Bhima App je you are downloading , you are also using .
In your eating the government would deposit 10 rupees .
If you get 200 people in a day then you can reduce 200 rupees till evening .
Compensation of businessmen can also occur , students can also earn .
And this plan is till 14th October .
You will have the contribution of digital India .
He had become the symbol of VIP culture in a way , only experience was telling that the red light was on the vehicle , it was costing on the vehicle , only slowly he turned his head and in his head this VIP culture was rotated deeply .
Now only the red light has gone , so the well can not claim that the red light that has come out in the head .
I have come a very interesting phone .
In this telephone he has also expressed his message , but at this time it is so impressed that normal person does not like this thing .
He feels a kind of irritability in the torture .
Namskar Pantprahanji , I speak Shiva Choubey , Jabalpur from Madhya Pradesh .
I read a flame in the utensil , in which I felt very humorous by listening to the everlasting Indian Is a VIP on a road that even today my time is equally important .
I do not want to stop the passing corner and I do not even have to stay for any reason .
That is why for this decision I have to take care of your mind .
Reaching red divine through government decision is a part of the system .
We also have to take it out of our minds .
If we try awakening together then we can get rid of it .
It is our own imagination of new India that in place of VIP increase the importance of EPI in the country and when I call EPI instead of VIP then my feeling is clear - Avery Person Is Important .
Every person has importance , every person has importance .
If we accept the significance of the well-known patriotism , then how big strength will be achieved to fulfill the great dreams .
We have to do all together .
My dear countrymen , I always say that we recall history , our culture , our tradition .
We get energy from it , we get inspiration .
This year we are celebrating a thousands of jyantis of the seventeen Koti Deshbandh Santa Ramanujacharya .
Because of some or the other reason we were so irritated , so little that we kept thinking for more than a century .
For other countries around the world it would be very important for centuries .
Only India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to realize the old memories of thousands of years and more than thousands of years .
Do some imagination .
Even today if social customs are said to be of TODAI then how many problems are there .
How would it happen a thousand years ago
He himself had done the society with his own conduct which he considered untouchables .
Thousands of years ago he had administered to enter his temple and successfully got the entry of the temple .
We are so lucky that in every age great men have come from our society itself to destroy the bad activity of our society .
While celebrating a thousand Jayanti of Santa Ramanujacharyaji , there is strength in social emotions , strength in union - we inspire them to awaken this feeling .
The Government of India is also publishing a telescope in memory of Rosie Santa Ramanujacharya .
I pay respectfully to Santa Ramanujacharyaji , honourable flows .
My dear countrymen , there is another significance of one in the world .
In many parts of the world it is also celebrated as a worker day .
And when workers come out of the topic of day , there was a discussion of labourers , there was talk of workers , then it is absolutely natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar .
And very little people know that we are administrators of Babasaheb for the honor that workers have received today .
For the welfare of workers the contribution given by Babasaheb is unforgettable .
Today when I talk about Babasaheb , Santa Ramanujacharyaji speaks about , then in the 12th century the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka Guru Basveeshwarji is also reminded .
I got a chance to go to a party right now .
There was a program to inaugurate their architectural museum .
In Kannada language he had said . Kave Kailash , which means - you can achieve the calculation of Lord Shankar 's house with your own wish i . . heaven only comes from doing work .
If you want to speak in other words then the work is Shiva .
I keep speaking again and again in the matter of ' Shree Jaite ' .
Today when we talk about workers then it is very natural to remember the dentist Thangdi .
My dear countrymen , after some days we celebrate Buddha Purnima .
Worldwide people associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals .
The problems which the world is facing today , competition of violence , war , destruction , enemy , when they see such an environment then the idea of Buddha seems very relevant .
And in India the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of this journey from war to Buddha .
My privilege is that this great parlor of Buddha Purnima is celebrated vessel day on the occasion of the United Nations .
This year it is celebrated in Sri Lanka .
Or the holy parlor I will get a chance of flowing honourable to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
You will get the opportunity to lighten their memory .
My beloved countrymen , India has always tried to move forward with the mantra ' Satha-Sabka Vikas ' .
And when we call ' everything development ' then it is not only in India but also in world context .
Many projects start .
In 5, Rosie India will launch South Asian sub-group.
The capacity of this sub-division and its related facilities will prove to be very helpful in fulfiling the economic and development programs of South Asia .
South Asia is an appropriate example of its complexity .
Most of the families of the country are in the preservation of their children .
Those whose tests have been done there is a little tension free environment and whose tests are still going on , there is little tension in those houses .
But at this time I said this only , that at the last time I had told the students that I had told them from the mother of the mind again .
At the time of examination those things will definitely be useful to us .
Today is 26th March .
On 26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh .
Otherwise in the leadership of a historical war , the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh .
Today on this important day , I give a lot of luxury to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh and wish that Bangladesh would grow , develop , I believe to the Bangladeshi people , that India is a support supporter of Bangladesh .
There is a good friend and we keep giving our participation in calmness , safety and development in this entire department by enjoying the shoulders .
We all realize that Rabindranath Tagore , his memory is a social heritage .
This is also the construction of Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore in the national anthem of Bangladesh .
One interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is also that he was not the first Asian person to receive Nobel Prize in 1913 , but the British gave him the status of ' Nighthood ' .
When in 1919 the Jallianwala Bagh was severely destroyed by the British , then Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who had raised their voices against or against demolition .
This was the time when a child of 12 years of age had a unique effect on the mind of this deterioration .
In adolescence , laughing in the fields , laughing in the plantation , giving a new inspiration of life to that child of the luxurious massacre of the Jallianwala Bagh .
In 1919 the boys of 12 years of age i . . the boys of all of us , their inspiration place , sister Bhagtsing .
Three days before from today on 23 March , Bhagatsinghji , his co - operative Sukhdev and Rajguru had been climbed by the British and we all know about that hour of March 23 .
On the face of Bhagatsingh , Sukhdev and Rajguru at that time Bharat had a solution to the worship of Mother , there was no fear of death .
He had sacrificed the dreams of life for the freedom of the mother of India .
These three heroes are still inspiration for themselves .
The story of the sacrifice of Bhagatsingh , Sukhdev and Rajguru will be decorated with the words .
I got the opportunity to go to that place a few days back , I realized that there are special sponsors in that land and I told the youths of the country , when the opportunity was received , we must go to the samadhi place of Bhagtsingh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , Bhagtsingh and Batukeshwar Datt .
Yes , it was just a time when the spirit of freedom , its speed , its business was going on increasing .
On the other hand heroes like Bhagtsingh , Sukhdev , Rajguru had inspired youths for cheap revolution .
So just 100 years before today on 10 April 1917 Mahatma Gandhiji had performed Champaranya Satyagraha .
This is the centuries of Champaranya Satyagraha .
In Indian freedom struggle , Gandhi thoughts , Gandhi style have been clearly seen during Champaranya Satyagraha .
In the entire journey of freedom fight this happens to be a significance , especially from the point of view of the method of union .
This was the time , Champaranya Satyagrah , Kheda Satyagrah , Ahmedabad the end of the mill workers here and the depths and functions of this greatest Gandhiji are seen to have come to an end .
In 1915 Gandhiji returned from abroad and on going to a small village in Bihar in 1917 he gave new inspiration to the country .
Today on the basis of that statue which is the statue of Gandhiji in our mind we can not assess Champaranya Satyagraha .
Imagine that a person comes back to India in 1915 and only two years work time .
The country did not know them , they did not have any effect , this was just the beginning .
At that time we can imagine how many difficulties they have to bear , how much work they have to take .
Champaranya Satyagraha was such an incident in which the union of Mahatma Gandhiji , Kaushalya , Mahatma Gandhiji ' s strength to recognize the nerve of Indian society , Mahatma Gandhiji ' s strength to facilitate the poor , uneducated persons to associate , inspire , bring them in the field to fight , shows the unique power of all this and thus we feel the dissolution of Mahatma Gandhiji .
This could be learned from them and that time was such that the big leaders which we hear , Gandhiji , at that time , would be Rajendrababu , that the Acharya grace had sent everyone to the camp .
And the British could not know what is the way of Gandhiji ' s work , association was also happening and new buildings were also happening .
On one side was the formation of union and the other .
On the other hand the caravans of the hijackers and on the other hand in the constructive work should be bowed automatically .
Trying to change the desire , change of the countrymen in the morning , this is why the new India ' s footsteps are being laid .
New India is not a government program or any state bird 's identity .
New India is the administration of hundreds of crores of people .
Many people are such who often go to the hospital , serve the patients , many such people who run away for blood donation as needed .
Many people worry about the stomach of the blind people .
Our country is multicoloured .
Public service i . . Prabhuseva is divided into our nerves .
If we see it in a collective form then it is such a great power .
If every citizen has envisaged that I will follow the rules of departure , if every citizen has decided that my pockets will be passed authentically , if every citizen has decided that one day in a week I will not use petrol-dissel , then things will be seen as small as possible .
We will see , the dreams of this country , New India , the people of hundreds of crores of people are watching , they will be fulfilled in front of our eyes .
The meaning of saying is that every citizen should follow his citizen 's religion , follow the duty .
My dear countrymen , I want to express my glory today .
In the past few days there has been such an environment in our country that people have been involved in digital payments and digital movements .
After meditating various types of increases of digital payments have been seen .
Bheem Pa has started only two-and-a-half months , but till now about one and a half crore people have downloaded it .
The fight against my beloved countrymen , black money and mischief is just before us .
Would the adventurous Koti countrymen enjoy two and a half thousand crore digital goddesses
We have declared economically .
If they take this work on the mind for the people of hundreds of crores of people then there is no need to wait for one year .
It'll work for six months.
Two and a half thousand crore digital behavior , if we are filled in school then do not fill in the streets , fill in digital ways .
We can do this in everyday life .
In the last few days many designated fairs have been organised for public education , public education .
There is a plan to make 100 programs throughout the country .
80-85 programs have been organized .
There were also twenty four plans in it .
Approximately two and a half lakh people have got expertise in the lucky gradual program .
70 thousand traders have acquired blessings for them .
With the completion of 100 days finally a big program is going on .
There is an arrangement of big salvation in it .
I am convinced that in the number of days for Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti we will spread Bhima in it .
How can the preventive blood deficiency be used , how can the use of the boat be reduced , for this we have to participate .
My dear countrymen , I am happy to say that every time when I ask information from the people for the mother of the mind , then many different kinds of information comes , but I have seen that there are information about cleanliness every time .
Honorable patriotism , my namskar , first of all I congratulated you , we achieved victory among these selectors .
I want to tell you about my mind .
I have to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness themselves .
I go through that river everyday where most people pollut the river with garbage in large quantity .
This river Rispna flows from the bridge from there , even comes to my house .
I have to say that we should bring this thing out through a group or a new paper .
Look at this , how much trouble is faced to the brethren and sisters , unknowingly learning .
Seeing the hair - garbage in the river how much anger comes to it .
I think this is a good symptom.
I want this only , in the minds of hundreds of crores of people there is a tricolor in the mind of the countrymen .
Since then cleanliness movement has started , awareness has come in people .
Everyone has been associated with it positively .
Now this has taken the form of a movement .
There has been an increase in irregularity .
Awakening , increasing active participation , it has a different importance .
But cleanliness is more related to habits than thrilling .
This is a thin habit of changing the habit of cleansing , it is thin to make the habit of cleansing .
This movement can occur in a collective form .
Work is difficult , but it has to be done .
I believe that the spirit that has been awakened in the new generations , children , students , youth of the country is giving a signal of good results automatically .
Today what Gayatri has said from the mother-in-law of the mind is listening to , I will tell the people of the world that the message of Gayatri is the message of every one of us .
Have we ever considered how many harms we do in this raw food which we put .
Sometimes it has been considered that it does not put such a scratch , if it does not spend food then how many poor people can fill stomach in it .
This is not such a subject which has to be understood .
When the food increases to the mother in our house then she says that as much as the child is needed .
Some or the other attempts continue to be made , but the sadness about this is a social sin .
This is injustice to the poor .
The second problem is such that if you are saved then the economic benefit of the family will be there .
I do not have to say much about this , but I feel that it is possible to increase awareness .
Some such youths are admitting me who run like this .
They have prepared mobile page .
Where such food is soaked or boiled he speaks to other people and uses that food properly .
Young people of our country are doing such a thing .
In every state of India such people will be found to us .
Their life also inspires us that do not spend food or not , increase food as much as you want .
There are only ways to change the sight , those people who are aware of health they usually tell that keep stomach slightly empty .
I tell the countrymen , depression is not an unbearable disorder .
One has to create a psychological environment and then the treatment starts .
Its first mantra is that instead of pressing sadness appear , become open .
Tell your colleagues , friends , parents , parents , teachers openly what happens to you .
Sometimes the problem of loneliness happens more to the students staying in the hospital .
They do not come near the table of food .
Has he taken care of what he does
We know that this is the first step towards depression .
If he is avoiding staying with a common family , is going to a single cop then it will not happen , take care of it very carefully .
With whom he asks openly see that he will stay in contact with such people .
After laughing , inspire him to become individual , wherever the tumor is settled in his mind open it .
This is the best solution .
Depression can become the cause of mental and physical diseases .
The way diabetes invites all diseases like fighting , adventurousness , depression on the ability to decide and destroys this capacity .
Your friend , your family , your environment can keep you away from getting sadness . If you are sad then you can also get out of that deliberation .
There is another solution .
If we are unable to open near our nearest man , do one work , where the work of help is done , go to such a place nearby .
If we try to understand their sorrows with service then a new self-confidence will be formed in our mind .
By combining others , by serving Kunn and by serving with unnecessary feeling the tension of mind becomes easy .
If seen then yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy .
Yogasadhan is very useful for stress free , free from depression , happiness .
On 21st June this is the International Yoga Day .
We also prepare from present and celebrate community yoga festivals in the number of lakhs .
If you have to make some information about yoga day , then you should reach me through my mobile placation , guide me .
We can create lyrics , poems about yoga , do this so that these subjects can reach the people easily .
But in the last few days the Government of India has taken an important decision .
The number of women working in our country is increasing everyday . This is definitely welcome .
He also has his hand in the economic responsibility of the household responsible for the responsibility of the family , due to which sometimes he becomes unjust to the newborn .
Government of India has taken an important decision about this .
While delivery , during pregnancy , maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal mortal maternal maternal maternal mortal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal mortal maternal maternal maternal maternal mortal mortal mortal m . . . . . . . . . . . . . m . . . . . . . . . m . . .
In this regard two or three countries in the world are ahead of us .
India has taken an important decision for its own citizens .
Its original purpose is to take care of those newborns who are the future citizens of India .
She was taken care of properly in the condition of childhood , she got the love of mother , then the same child would become the wealth of the country .
Due to this the health of mothers will also be better and therefore the benefit of this important decision will be about 18 lakh women .
We must get inspiration from the life of all these great men , get the power to compose for New India .
Two days later , Chaitra Shukla is a resistance , annual responsibilities , new culture , this new year we like .
After spring season it is time for the starting of yield of yield of yield and yielding fruit of yield of yield to yield it .
New year is welcomed in different ways in different parts of our country .
New year is welcomed in Gudhipadwa , Andhra and Karnataka in Ugadi , Sindhi Cheti - Chand , Kashmiri Navreh , Savsar Puja in Awadh province , connected to Mithila province in Bihar , Satwani in Magadh province .
India is a country of innumerable varieties .
We all have many good wishes from me of this new year .
Many blessings.
The cold ends now .
The spring has entered into the life of all our people .
Besides the fruits of summer season the mood of the whole of Ammon is seen in spring itself .
At the same time yellow flowers of peacock in the fields , fields give new standing to the minds of the farmers .
The dried flowers of turmeric indicate the coming of Holi .
Amir Khusro has described the moment of this change in nature as very interesting .
Ameer Khusro writes, "Full rahi sarson gross, Ambava feet, Tesu flowers, coal spoke, Dar-Dar.
When nature is happy , the environment is happy , then humans also enjoy this weather completely .
The climate of spring fifteenth , Mahashivratri and Holi fills the color of joy in human life .
In the environment full of love , brotherhood and humanity we are enjoying the last month of Falgun and have been decorated to welcome the next Chaitra month .
The confluence of these two months is spring .
First of all , I consider lakhs of citizens of the country as a pride , when I ask for death from myself , information comes to me in large quantity .
Shobhaji , we remembered this respectful workforce of India , our respect for this .
Whether it is decreasing , prevention of diseases , connecting with the world , knowledge , knowledge , knowledge , technology , science have acquired its importance .
15 February , 2017 is the honorary day of India ' s life .
Our scientists have raised the mind of India in front of the world and everyone knows that in the last few years ISRO has successfully fulfilled many charms .
After the successful work of sending the museum under Mars Mission on the marshy planet , in the last few days ISRO has established a worldwide sale in the interior .
This success has to be said to be historical not only for ISRO but also for the country of South India .
This cosmetic effect of ISRO has proved to be a wonder for the world like the spiritual program and the world has also made the open mind aware of this success of Indian scientists .
Brothers and sisters , one of these 104 sub-divisions is extremely important , cartosat 2D , this is the sub-division of India and through this sub-division the use of mola is being done for photographs , information , meaming , infrastructure development facilities , information of development , urban development planning .
Especially how many water sources are there in my farm brothers and sisters , how can they be used
It is also a matter of joy for us that the leadership of this community has been done by its young scientists , our female scientists .
This much big part of the youth and women is the page of a great pride of the success of ISRO .
I enjoy the scientists of ISRO according to the local residents .
For ordinary people , these scientists have maintained the purpose of using international science for the benefit of the nation and they are recording newcomers .
No matter how much we enjoy these scientific skins , their skins , it will prove to be less .
Scientists of India have shown this .
The capacity of this area is such that even from a distance of 200 kilometres , if any damage has come to attack India , then its damage will destroy it in the intervals itself .
When we see a new technique , some new scientific research takes place then we enjoy it .
Those who do not get the same answer they do not stay healthy .
And if we observe the journey of human excitement of thousands of years , then we can say that this development journey is no longer complete rest .
New science , new techniques are formed from it itself and every technique , the form of every new science , gives birth to a new age .
My beloved youth , when we talk about the hard work of science and scientific science , then many times I have said that our younger generation has to increase the attraction towards science .
The country needs many scientists .
In today 's scientific age this can become the reason for a change in the life of the poor generations .
A few days back Niti Ayog and the Ministry of Environment of India had organised a different kind of competition during 14 businessmen Indian Day .
Social useful researches have been invited .
Sometimes in order to find out the answer , problem only indicates the importance of science .
In Mumbai in 2005 AD there was immense increase , Mahapur came , in the sea also there was a lot of complications .
When any natural crisis comes then the most visible crisis comes on the poor .
Two people worked completely on this and developed such a way of home bondage , which will save households while such a crisis , will save people from coming home , save water from coming home and being polluted by polluted water will save them from diseases .
Instruments are also becoming systematic .
In a way technology is becoming an indispensable part of our life .
In the past few days emphasis has been seen on the DG - Dhan .
Especially the younger generation has the habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones .
I believe that this is a good symptom .
In the past few days in our country ' lucky grahak Yojana ' , ' Design - Dhan trade plan ' have got good text .
About two months have passed , 15 thousand people are getting one thousand rupees daily .
Through these two plans India has been welcomed in the entire country with the aim of making public transportation .
It is a matter of happiness that today ten lakh people have been found in the DG-Dhan Yojana , more than fifty thousand businessmen have got nutritious and more than one and a half hundred crore rupees have been found in the form of blood pressure , this great work has been found in the form of a lot of people ahead .
In this program there are more than 100 graduals who have got one lakh rupees in the form of transplantation .
There are traders on four thousand who have got fifty - fifty thousand rupees axe .
From Mysore Shriman Santosh has written on Nandra Modi Ap while expressing happiness that he got a reward of one thousand rupees in the lucky grocery program .
But one important thing he has written is that I feel that he should reach you .
He has written that he got a blessing of a thousand rupees , at that time he came to know that a poor woman 's house had got fire and all the goods were burnt in that fire .
Santoshji , our navy and our work are satisfying us all .
We have done a lot of inspiring work .
After twenty years of worker Bhai Sabir in Delhi , now he has been associated with digital behavior . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A young student of Maharashtra performs puja namade , post mortem exercise , what is the use of that form card , e-wallet in their family and how much joy is obtained in it reaches others .
How important is the award of one lakh rupees for them , but they have taken this work as a dress and others are also joining it .
This is the role of a lot of thickness in the fight against mirror , brushing and black money .
Every section connected with this work , from my point of view , the country is anti-corruption cadre , anti-corruption path .
In one way you are a soldier of sweetness .
On 14th April everyday one big , crore rupees will be taken out of the market .
There are more than forty-two days Shillak .
Remembering them we should learn to download the Bhima App at least 125 people .
Learn what happens to Devavan-Ghevan from them .
Especially those small , kirkola traders who are near you should teach them .
At this time Jayanti and Bhima App of Babasaheb Ambedkar give special importance to this .
And therefore I want to tell you that you have to make your feet vigilant by Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
Going home , connecting everyone , it is possible to reach Bhima App to 125 crore hands .
For the last two-three months , the result of which the movement has started was that many urban settlements , many camps and many cities have achieved a lot of success .
My dear countrymen , there is a great contribution of agricultural sector in the roots of our country 's economy .
The economic power of the village sacrifices the economic speed of the country .
I want to tell us a very pleasant thing today .
Your farmer brothers and sisters have filled the lap of cereals with hard meals .
Due to the suffering of the fields of our country this year there is a dearth of production .
Like the records it is said that our fielders have taken out all the earlier sales .
This year there has been such a yield in the field that it seems as if Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today .
This year more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of cereals have been produced in the country .
It is more than eight times more than the earlier sale on the name of our fields .
This is an unprecedented success in itself .
I specially give thanks to the fields of the country .
Thanksgiving also gives the production of pulses by considering the poor in the country along with traditional picks because most of the proteins are available to the poor from the pulses .
I was happy that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and about two hundred ninety lakh hectares lagged different pulses on the ground .
This is not just the production of pulses but also the greater service of the poor in my country done by the fielders .
My destination is , a prayer , for the way my fielders finished and produced rice , my farmer brothers and sisters are eligible for special wealthyism .
My dear countrymen , in our country , from the government , from the society , from the institutions , from the organizations , everybody 's cleansing , some programs are being started .
In one way everyone is seen to be aware of some or the other way of cleanliness .
The government is also trying continuously .
A program of 23 state governments under the leadership of our civil servants who are eating drinking water and cleansing of this department of water and water transportation has been inaugurated here some days ago .
There is no discussion in the closed room here , but what is the significance of the work of pure cleanliness
On 17th and 18th February the toilet pitting exercise was organised in Hyderabad using it .
They were cleansed by empty toilet pits of six houses and most of the officers showed themselves that they could use the tablets used by Twin Pit Toylet , empty and use it again .
He also showed how comfortable the toilets built by using this new technique and there is no difficulty in cleaning them while emptying , there is no hesitation , mental interference also does not stop .
As we clean others and clean a toilet .
And this is the purity of the rock of the toilet , in which we consider it as a carpet , then it is a kind of black gold .
We can see what the wealth is produced from West to Wealth i . . garbage , and it has been proved .
For the family of six people a standard Twin Pit Toylet . This model is filled in about five years .
After that by removing that garbage easily one can get rid of the other in the throat .
In six to twelve months there is a disintegration of the garbage deposited in the khand .
Nitrogen , phosphorous , potassium -LRB- potassium -RRB- are full of nutritious substances and it is considered to be a very good source in the field .
The way the government has taken it forward , others have also used it by taking it forward .
Now on television this special program of hygiene is being started .
The more such things are displayed in it the more it will get benefit .
Different departments of the government organise cleaning system regularly .
In the second Pandharvada of March the Ministry of Navahan and Waterfalls , river development and Ganga Reservation Ministry , these two more departments are going to be cleaning campaigns ahead .
We are tired that even the well of our country when the citizen does something good then the whole country feels a new energy , self-confidence starts increasing .
We welcomed the work done by our Divang players in Rio paralysis .
The country feels their pride towards the success of this Divya Sang Sahakanya .
I often believe that Divyang is brethren - genetic , strong , strong , strong , strong .
Every moment we can get to learn something or the other from them .
Whether the issue is of game , international science is not behind the female angle of our country .
Pedestrian footpath couples are walking ahead and with their success the name of the country is enjoying , some days before the Asian rubbish serving trophy competition their women association has removed silver medal .
I wish all these sportsmen many adventures .
Women 's day is celebrated on March 8 in the world .
In India also in order to give importance to girls , to increase awareness about them in family and society , to increase sensitivity .
This moment is going forward fast .
Today this was not just a government program .
Today it has become the form of a movement of social communication and public education .
In the last two years common man has been associated with this program .
To think about this lifestyle in every corner of the country has become part of this program .
It has been converted into the thoughts of people about the old customs going on annually .
When the festival is celebrated after the birth of the child then it gets a lot of joy .
In a way positive thoughts about girls are becoming the cause of social acceptance .
I have heard that in Tamil Nadu state the Kuddloor district brought a ban on the childhood path under a special campaign .
Under the Conversion Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir all the departments have been connected with the ' Mauli Savings and Mauli Shikwa ' program . along with orphan girls participating in the program , they get education , efforts are being made by the district administration .
In this program of ' Hari Ghar Dastaka ' in Madhya Pradesh , education is being started for domestic girls in villages .
In Rajasthan the program is being started to inspire the girls who have left school by running ' Apna Bacha ' , ' Vidyalaya ' campaign to bring them back to school .
New imaginations are being associated with it .
It has changed according to local needs .
When we celebrate the Women's Day on March 8, we have a single feeling- "Women, Wow Shakti, Shakti, Yes, we are the women of India, we are not working, we are entitled to the same. "My dear countrymen, we all get a chance to communicate something from the mind.
We also participate actively .
I am extremely beloved for my participation .
My beloved countrymen, wear all of you.
On 26 January , our Sunday we celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country .
This is a festival which reminds of the kingdom of India , the duties of the citizens , the rights of the citizens and their commitment to the publicity , that is , on the coming generations it is a matter of awareness about the responsibility of losing in public state .
But in our country there is no more information about the extent to which citizens have been discussed , the extent to which they have been discussed in a wider way .
I hope that at every level, the more important powers are to be given, the more important duties.
On this day at 11 o'clock in the morning we pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed life for the country .
On the day of 30 January at 11 . minute this two minute is known as this society , to become its easy nature in the form of a country .
I enjoy the families of the virgins who were honored with different gallantry awards on the eastern day of this day .
Among these awards there are many classes like Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , Param Special Service Medal , Special Service Medal .
I am specially a group of youths of the country and you are very active on social media .
Can you do one thing , this time the virgins who have received this honor you will find information on the internet and write two good words about them reach your friends .
When we know about the adventure of these gallants , about their gallantry , by going in the open about their magnificence then we feel surprised , glorious and inspiration too .
While on the other hand we were enjoying reading the battalion celebrated everywhere on 26 January , while the soldiers working to protect the borders of our country in Kashmir had to lose their lives due to the avalanche .
I devote all those heroic soldiers with respect , devote them .
My younger brothers , you have the desire that I keep telling you the mother of my mind continuously .
In January , February , March , April all the months i . . every family has a long time .
In almost every house there is a test of one or two children but all the family would have been buried under the guise of that test .
That is why this time is appropriate for my students to contact friends , their parents , teachers because for many years where I go , wherever I meet , the test of the children is seen to be very careful .
Family contemplation , students are careful , teachers are in discourse , such a big strange mental condition appears to be prepared at every house .
When I am talking about this matter then many teachers , readers , students sent me messages , sent questions , sent some information , we also mentioned the problems and problems that occur to us .
I want to express the ideas that came in my mind after reading all that .
I got a telephone message in the creation.
You listen to what the world says . sir , on the days of the test of Sayyachany , there was a very horrible environment in our society , neighboring and neighboring .
Because of this if the minds of the students are found standing then not only does we become depressed .
Does I think so much that this environment can not become pleasant
The question is fulfilled in the universe , but it is in the mind of all ourselves .
There are very few such people who are seen in the tests .
Most of them used to be tested as a pressure.
That is the rare pressure that you have to decide the playsure .
The plague which goes to this test after accepting happiness will get the same chalk fruit and the time of recession will come on which the plague i . . thrice falls .
That is why I believe that you should not abstain from the tests , as if they are something or the other .
This is the strength of the festival .
The whole family has crossed this festival with the enthusiasm of the working role of fulfillment .
Seeing the picture will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh all these three to four months are tested .
In these three-four months , according to your traditions , convert the environment of your family according to the time of festival .
And so I'll tell you, smile more, score more.
In a stressful situation all the doors are closed , nothing can go inside from outside and insomnia can not come out .
As if the thought process stops and these things sit loudly .
And you do not have knowledge , lack of knowledge , lack of mehenna is there .
But if there is tension then your knowledge , information about yourself vanishes under it and tension only takes place on it .
It is important to keep in mind that the help of a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems as if we do not see the test from the right point of view .
So as if something is a question of life-for-for-for-for-for-freeness then it is our mentality .
This test is just about what you have done in the year .
You do not have to take the story of your whole life there .
How you have lived , how you are living , how you have lived ahead , this is not a test of all these things .
Besides the tests given by professionals in class , you have gone from the context of many episodes .
Then get rid of such bitterness , in front of us the Majijijid President of the country .
J.
In today 's time what I see in front of education is that it has become the center of education .
Marks are getting very important .
Because of this the competition has increased , along with this the stress on the mind of the students has increased a lot .
I have to know your thoughts about this current attitude of the educational system and its future .
Well , in his question he has answered , but the desire of the R . . is to tell me something about this matter .
There is a limited use of qualities and chromosomes .
If you believe in these things then Mark will come back from us , you will never need to run away from them .
You have to use knowledge in life , your story is going to be useful , the use of self-confidence , determination is going on .
If you go to a lawyer to fight your bigger furnace then do you see its mark sheet
In the field of its experience , knowledge and intelligence successful travel is seen this thing there .
That is why Markanch has sometimes stopped from going towards the right direction .
Richaji has also faced the problem of continuous competition with others .
This is a very big mental war .
It is easy to understand examples related to sports therefore I tell that only .
The speciality of most successful players was that their competition is automatically .
We take the example of Sanchin Tandulkar.
Twenty years of time they know their own virginity , knowing that they are going forward defeating themselves .
So because of the wind to say great miracles they followed the way of self-prompted competition from others .
In every area of Ayurveda , this question also you considered yourself . I could practice calmly two hours before , now the three hours of exercise rays contain me .
Let's get up early in the morning, now get up early
Before the stress of test it is not for sleep , can it now come
They have said ,  My mother has not been very learned .
Even then he had to sit near me and leave maths from me .
I just tell the parents that they should fill up three things , accepting rays , learning and giving time .
The parents will feel that they are at the edge of many problems more than the children of their teachers .
You will also get rid of yourself .
I was present there then and I saw that they did not consider any question related to the fact of that patient .
Come , they started listening to Vinodi jokes .
In four-five minutes only the atmosphere was settled .
Aravi keeps on scaring on talking about the diseases going to meet the patient .
The parents have to tell me the same thing . Sometimes we are aware of our wealth with children .
What should we ever think of giving children a happy , laughing environment during examination
So let's see, the environment changes.
I have come to the phone call of a big lotus .
He says , Namaskar Pant chief prince , I can not tell myself the name because my childhood is the same thing as I do .
I had tried to copy my childhood once .
And when we tried to make a clear copy then it was also caught because of me many friends around me have suffered a lot .
Those who are the roads of shortcut they become the reason for copying .
Hey, you've heard many times.
I'll tell you that again.
Even if seen in any way the effect of copying is seen .
That very surgeonicity , if that time spends on that tested time then maybe there is no need to copy .
A phone call has come to me , he says , " My name is Monica , my name is Monica . I am the 12th student so I have to ask some questions related to the board examination .
My first question is of increasing stress in these tests , how can it be reduced
During the days of examination if I talk about playing and playing then your teacher , your palanquin will run on me .
In the course of examination how the children who are talking about playing , how are they important , it would be narrow .
Because it has been considered in the games that the attention of the study is less towards us .
This information is wrong in the root only .
The problem is the root there itself .
Watch a little sky after coming out for two moments from your exercise , watch the trees of the autumn , lighten your mind and then sit in your room .
Become for five minutes but give this time of rest automatically .
You're gonna see that work was more swimming.
Everyone would like that no matter what , but my experience tells me the same thing .
For this there is no need to sit in the room .
While standing under the open eyeball , go to the glass , breathe for five minutes and then sit to practice .
Some people believe that if you wake up for a long time at night then exercise will be done very much .
But not .
Definitely take as much sleep as the body is important .
There will be a total increase in your activity .
When I go to the campaigns of the selects then sometimes my voice remains sitting .
At such a time I had come to see a folk song .
They thought to me, but how long do you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously .
Otherwise your family members will run on me .
It is a very thick medicine for keeping mind , brain , body aware .
Well, young friends, you're complicated in the preparation of tests and I'll sit in my mind.
Kunas Chowk , maybe my words will help in removing the stress of your mind .
But at the same time I also said that do not take care of what I told you .
If there is accumulation then do not do it , otherwise it will also become an ozone .
Do not delay the desires of children , the thing that your parents have told me is also applicable to me .
We have to face tests by keeping the determined mind hatched , self-confident .
My beloved is with you .
To cross every town give the form of festival only in that town .
Then there is no examination of this test .
You go ahead with the same mantra.
Famous countrymen , on 1 February , 217 everyday the Indian Telecommunication Team is completing forty years .
This context I consider all the princes and soldiers of the Takshak Dal as their pride for the service of the country .
With automatic 126 ships and 62 aircraft Indian Telecommunication Team is considered to be the fourth largest Telecommunicator group of the world .
According to our ideal swings the soldiers of the technological group are alert to protect the maritime borders and sea areas of the country while guiding .
Last year along with their responsibilities the Teacher 's Party has made an honorable work to clean the seashore of our country .
Thousands of people were involved in this .
Along with the protection of the sea shores they are really happy to take care of the cleanliness of these shores .
Very little people must have hoped that not only men but women are also losing their responsibilities with their shoulders and successfully crossing their responsibilities .
Our women officers of the technological group are humid , neglectful , are also responsible for overcraft .
Today while the security of the beach on the global level is a question of Raniwar , the Indian technicians shivering to protect the shores of India give me an admiration of their 40 businessmen .
On 1 February the festival of spring fifteenth is celebrated .
It is considered the time of the study of the university .
Not only this this is the time of inspiration for the heroes .
The same motivation is seen in this song of America color The Basanti Chola .
Because of this sacred sanctuary of the spring fifteenth I wish all my countrymen a lot .
While spreading my beloved countrymen , the skyscrapers also fill new colors with their imagination .
The mother of the mind gives you a very big opportunity to go to contact with you .
Very nice.
My beloved countrymen , Namaskara , we all have many splendors of mortality .
Today 's day is the day of giving importance to service , excavation and doing .
Jesus Christ has said , if poor do not get our favour then our acceptance is air .
St . Luke has written in Ganspell , this is not only the service of the poor but also the advantage of the servants made by the poor and this is the right meaning .
A story related to it is very popular .
It is said that Jesus was standing near the Khajuraho of a temple .
Many Smyants came and they performed plenty of donations .
After that a poor widow came and she kept a bow of two copper in it .
Now if we go to see then what is the root of two copper pearls
There was surprisingness in the minds of the people standing there.
Then he told that the widow has donated the most , others have donated much , but this woman has donated everything to her .
Two days beforehand I got the opportunity of the inauguration of many development works in Varanasi in the penance of Malviyaji .
I laid the foundation stone of the Mahammim Madan Mohn Malviya Cancer Centre in Varanasi .
Today Bharat Ratna and Maji Pant are the days of the birth of the most respected Atal Bihari dynasty .
Your country will never forget the contribution made by Atalji .
Under their leadership the value of the country has also been raised in the field of molecular energy .
Whether the party leader, the parliament member, the minister or the president, Atlaji built an ideal in every landmass.
On the day of the birth of Atalji I compensate them and prays Goddess for their best health .
A worker or maternal uncle benefited me from working with Atlaji .
Many memories are waking up in front of my eyes today .
Today in the morning when I tweeted , even an old painting I shaved on it , I would definitely understand how the love of Atlaji would be beneficial in the form of a small worker .
Today on the day of mortality the citizens of the country are getting the benefit of two schemes .
In one sense the beginning of two newest plans is happening .
Everyone has to learn from each other , understand .
To encourage this , to get the strength of mobile banking in this process , to get the habit of e-payment , the encouraged program of the central government of the audience and small businessmen is being started from today .
Fortunate Grahak Yojana ' is a plan to encourage the audience while Digi Dhan Business Scheme is a plan to encourage the traders .
This plan will start from today and the next 100 days will start .
Everyday 15 , 000 people get a discount of 1 , 000 rupees per day .
At the same time for such teachers one day will be released from a week , in which lakhs of rupees are given a blessing , after three months 14 April daily .
Babasaheb Ambedkar has a glimpse , on that day there will be a Mahasodat in which a blessing of more than Rs . can be given .
Digi Dhan trade plan ' is mainly for businessmen .
Autonomously the traders should participate in this program and also include the customers in order to free their behavior .
For such businessmen also independent bakshas are given and these bakshas are also in thousands of numbers .
The trade of traders will also keep on running automatically and along with it they will also get the opportunity to enjoy bakshas .
This plan has been prepared keeping all sections of the society especially poor and lower middle class citizens in the center .
Those who buy more than 3,000 rupees will not get the benefit of these boxes .
The poor citizens of the poor can also buy luggage through Fitcher phone or general phone using USSD , can also provide money and they all can be beneficiaries of this Bakshis program .
In rural areas also through A . . . shopping can be done and birds can also live .
30 crore citizens can immediately participate in this Bakshis program .
This is very easy as much as we send the message easily from Whatsup .
I am happy to see my beloved countrymen , how to use technology in our country , how to do e-payment , how to do online payment , its awareness is increasing rapidly .
In the last few days preventive behavior has increased by 200 to 300 percent .
To encourage this the Government of India has taken a big decision .
The businessmen can surely estimate how big this decision is .
Those traders who will go to Devangewaan through digital routes , will provide the facility of online payment instead of blocking their caravans , such traders have been suited from income tax .
The chief minister of Andhra .
A committee has been prepared under the chairmanship of Chandrababu Naidu .
At the same time I have seen that many schemes have been started by the state governments on their own .
Somebody told me that the Assam government has decided to pay 10 percent of the wealth by depositing and paying compensation to the business license fee through digital .
The branches of rural banks which will take at least two digital behaviours in the period of January to March by their 75 percent teachers , they will get a fee of Rs . 50 , 000 through the government .
Until 31 March , 20017 he has also announced the declaration of giving a blessing of Rs . five lakhs under the best scheme to the disciplinary behaviour of 100 percent digital behaviour .
The Assam Government has declared a deliberation of Rs . 5 , 000 to the first ten farmers who have been fully dedicated to woo and buy the pomegranate under the digital farmer Shiromani scheme for the farmers .
I congratulate the Assam government and enjoy all the governments that run this kind of program .
Many organizations have been successfully used to encourage digital Devan Gewani among the poor fields of villages .
Somebody told me that the companies related to Gujarat Narmada Khore , Khata and Chemical limited these minerals have put POS machines where the minerals are sold for the facilities of the fields . In just a few days Tabal 35 , 000 farmers bought and bought it by filling the five lakh gold digital routes of the minerals of the minerals only two weeks .
In comparison to the fact that in comparison to the previous year the sale of the company has increased 27 percent .
Brothers and sisters , in our economy , the spread of informal sector has increased in our lifestyle and most of these people are given money , money of work , money of work or ventilation , observed and due to this the absorption of animals keeps on happening .
Where one needs to get 100 rupees , there you get 80 rupees .
Together with this they are also entitled to the benefits of other benefits .
Our country is the most powerful country .
Treatment is easy for us .
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this region .
Our youth has also made a lot of progress in the field of Start Up .
These are golden days of digital swing .
Our youth can enable the area with new imagination , new technique , new methods , they should do this .
At the same time in the aim of keeping the country free from black money and frustration we must also participate with complete strength .
My beloved countrymen , I urge the people to give their advice , tell their thoughts every month .
At this time 80 to 90 percent of the cattle that have come to Mai Gaw and Narendra Modi Paw are fighting against foolish and black money , Notbundi is in reference .
When I saw all this , Dhobal Mani divided them in three parts .
Some people have written a comprehensively about what kind of difficulty and misery the citizens have to face in the advice given me .
For the welfare of the country such good works , even after the beginning of such holy work , in some places , how new ways of discovering are being done , this is written by other types of people .
The third kind of people have written this war on the basis of what happened .
The number of citizens with the admiration is also symptoms of foolishness , black money should be completely destroyed and it should be lifted up even when needed .
This way I consider the pride of all the people of the country who help me send a lot of letters .
Mr . Gurumani Kewal has said that this step taken completely to stop the behavior of the periodic money is eligible for Kautuka .
We are fighting like Lashkari Balan in protest against Bhrastachar , Kala Pasa .
The words written on the notes are wrong , the rate of sweets has increased , the notes of two thousand rupees are also canceled , the list of 500 rupees and 100 rupees is going to be canceled , many such afflictions have spread .
The minds of the citizens of this country remained confused just after listening to the afflictions .
Not only this many people landed in the plains , they brought out the whole face of the people spreading fools using their expertise , intelligence , reflected the wrong and brought the truth to everyone .
This capacity of the people is also mine 100 percent pranam .
Today , my dear countrymen , I feel that when hundreds of millions of people are standing with us then nothing is impossible .
Janta Janadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God .
The citizens of the country have participated with full enthusiasm in this magnificent honor of the people of the country .
I felt as if there was a comprehensive discussion about the struggle which began with the brave and black money .
If the work of reading has been done then it would have been a good idea .
Some people are spreading apart from being all kinds of wealth to the state birds , they are completely wrong .
Treatment is similar to all .
Whether it is a person or a partner or a state party , everyone should follow the doctor and everyone has to do it .
Those people who can not openly support the misconception and time money they spend time in finding the faults of the government .
Repeated changes of rules , such a question arises .
This government is for publicity .
Who has been involved in this timely behavior of dishonesty and misconception for 70 years , how much strength is their strength
When I decided to fight with such people then he started a new attempt everyday to defeat the government .
On the other hand on the other hand many citizens have also written discussions about the original behavior and various conversations .
In comparison to the information given by the government system many times more information is giving to the common citizen .
The success achieved by us is achieved due to the awareness of the most common citizen .
In order to give such information the government has prepared an e-mail address on which this information can be sent .
I consider all those who write such utensils as special pride , their utensils have faith and blessings are good .
This is not complete rest .
This is the beginning .
Not only the question of tiredness , there is no question of stopping and for the work for which the blessings of hundreds of crores of citizens are beneficial there is no question of taking care of them .
We must have known that there is a law in the context of anonymity in our country . This law was prepared in 1988 .
So it would have been kept in the basin .
We expelled him and brought the effective benami wealth to the bottom .
In the coming days this cloud will start showing its effect .
We have been the best priority to do what we have to do for nationwide , people .
In order to make the industry of the world bank improvement has been done in the order of India .
In the World Competition of the World Economic Organisation India has joined 32 places .
In the World Renownment Decision in 2016 we have taken a hut of 16 places and have taken a hut of 19 places in 2016 in the workmen ' s country through the World Bank .
The maintenance of many guests is doing such a direction that India is moving fast .
My beloved countrymen , this time the citizens of the country became narrow by the administration of the Parliament .
The feeling of anger was expressed by the repudiation of the procession worker from all sides .
President and vice president also openly expressed their displeasure over it .
In such situations also sometimes some good things occur and gives relief to the mind .
A good work has been done in the Gadarol starting in contact only , but the attention of the country has not been paid attention to it .
I am glorious and happy to say that my government has agreed with a legitimate relationship related to it , which is going ahead with the love of brothers and sisters .
For this I consider the princes of all the people of the state and all the specialists of the state , according to the dedicated divine people of the country I consider them their respect .
Our government is also committed to Divyaganga .
I have tried to speed up the person .
I would like to get their hand to the divine parts , if they are worthy then it would be my desire to get respect .
By hiding four medals in Paralimbique our Divyang brother Bhagini gave us a new settlement of our efforts and belief .
Because of his victory he raised the neck of the country and along with it he also surprised the people of his capacity .
Our Divyang brother Bhagininu also has an invaluable heritage like every citizen of the country , strength .
After this legitimate agreement for the protection of the Divyas they will get more chance of the job , so I am happy .
In government jobs also the limit of reservation has been increased to 4 percent .
The government has ended the new law according to the views of the United States .
There are 14 categories filled in it .
My youth colleagues , in the last few weeks this work has been done that we will feel respected even on the fields of sports .
Indian Cricket Association has made such a zincle of Malika 4-0 which started against England .
Some youth sportsmen worked in this .
If Karun Nair or our youth player tridents .
L.
Staying played 199 races .
The Karnadhar Virat Kohli of the Kasoti Sangh did good leadership of the Sangh while doing good functioning .
Indian Cricket Association of Spinner Golandaz R.
Ashwin was declared as the crater of the year of 2016 and the best colony cracket .
All of these enjoyments with me .
In the area of hawky also after 15 years a good news has come , good news has come .
Jinnier Hawki Sangh has won worldwide jinns .
After 15 years Tabal , the junior hockey union has named the world class .
About this workmanship the minds of young players .
This workmanship is in the shape of the future of the Indian Hockey Association .
In the last month our women players also did good work .
The hockey union of Indian women jinked the Asian opportunistic competition and recently in 18 years back the Indian women 's group earned the bronchitis medal in Asian chocolate competition .
I enjoy the heart of all the players of Cricket and Hockey Association .
My beloved countrymen , the coming year 2017 is the year of new happiness and enthusiasm , you will complete all your compositions and we will gather the new peaks of development .
This should also be giving a chance to the poor of the new year to live a life of happiness .
For the year 20017 or year many luxuries of all the countrymen from me .
Very humiliating.
Like this every year even today I went to India - China Seyur to celebrate Diwali with my Indian people .
The soldiers of ITBP , the soldiers of the Sanya Dal , along with all these I celebrated Diwali in the higher part of the Himalayas .
Every time it goes , but the experience of this Diwali was something different .
The unparalleled way of offering this Diwali sanctuary to the soldiers of the country , dedicated to the security forces , the same reflection was felt on the face of each of those soldiers .
Kuny poems, take pictures, take a well cartoon, some people made a video.
That is , every house , as if we were watching only a few seconds , and when I read these grandsons then I would feel very surprised .
How many these complications are filled with feelings these patterns .
At the same time there was an information on ' May Gove ' , can the same coffee table book be made by mixing the selected things in it
One of our soldiers wrote me , Pantprahanji , Holi of our soldiers , Diwali , every one is on the border .
As if we are celebrating Diwali with the white coat Indians .
My dear countrymen , on this day how will we go on staying limited only in some contexts .
I despise you , as a society , as a nation , we can apply this habit to us . Whatever happens , festivals , how to keep in mind the soldiers of our country in some way .
When all the nations are standing with the sanyadala then the strength of our army increases in hundreds of crores .
A few days back the Sarpanch of Jammu and Kashmir state had come to meet me .
He was a member of the Jammu - Kashmir Panchayat Parishad .
It had come from different parts of the Kashmir Valley , about 40 - 50 people .
I got the opportunity to speak to them for a long time .
He had come to the forefront of the development of his village .
There were some of their demands and when our translation began , the future of the children came out in the bottom of Kashmir .
Schools are set on fire in Kashmir , their discussions were overwhelmed and I would see that as much pain as all our countrymen were suffering , they also suffered .
They say , not only school but also future jewellery of children .
I despised them that we should pay attention to the future of these children .
A few days back the board was tested there . children and girls of Kashmir , about 95 percent students and students gave this board examination .
I would like to enjoy them for this excitement shown by them , but I would like to bless them all , their parents , relatives and their teachers and the Sarpanch of all the villagers .
Dear brothers and sisters , at that time when I asked for information from myself for the mother of the mind , then I can tell you that everyone sent information on one subject .
Everything was being said , talk about the points of 500 and 1000 .
I also felt that in our daily life we have to face many kinds of new problems .
The way to get rid of the disease which we used to face for 70 years is not easy .
I can understand the difficulty that happens to us.
Five hundred and thousand small and so big country , this decision of such a movement , absurdity and absurdity .
The whole world is watching Barkains , every economist does a very good analysis here .
In the entire country the central government , state government , department of local health institutions , one lakh thirty thousand bank branches , lakhs of bank employees , more than one lakh post offices , more than one lakh banks , friends , day-night have been connected with the point of view of dedication .
Despite many types of tensions , all of these are working as an attempt of a great change considering this work as a sacrifice of the country .
Start in the morning , when will the night be completed .
Suddenly money was needed .
Many such incidents come out everyday from TV , present utensil , church .
I consider all these co-operators who do this great work , who prove to be male and female .
The identification of the capacity is only when success comes after the tumor .
I remember Changal , when the first public money scheme was started and the bank workers had taken the burden of it on their shoulders and the work that wears in 70 years , they were showing it .
Today he has accepted that once again and I am confident that the composition of hundreds of crores of people , the collective men of all , will present this nation a new power .
But such bad habits have spread that even today many people do not have those bad habits .
Some people even more feel that this money of mischief , this black money , this unsuccessful money , anonymity money , finding some ways and bringing them back to the system .
They are searching for obstructive ways in the attempt to save their money .
The sadness is that in this they have chosen the way to use the poor .
While wandering the poor and showing joy or temptation they are trying to save money by filling money in their eating or making some work from them .
I want to tell such people today , improve or improve or do not improve our wishes , rays of law , what will they do to see
But do not play with the life of the poor by cheering .
And the government does not want that our countrymen will face difficulties .
I am Tirali village , Taluka Tirali , J . Hadra , Madhya Pradesh is a common citizen here .
We stopped the boats of five hundred and thousand , this is definitely admirable .
My desire is that many such examples brought in front of the people from the mind that even after being unheard of people welcome to this hard step for nation ' s advancement .
Because we say that good days will come , but we will take such a thick step , we will never wait for any other bitch .
Seeing all these five hundred and thousand dollars , black money and foolish people have got a good stadium .
There will never be good days for each Indian .
It feels so happy that what is the unique potential of the common man in my country .
People go there , eat and when they go from there again after 2 . days they pay .
This is the strength of my country , in which there is service , patience and authenticity .
During the time of selecting I had the ' Church ' program of Rabvala and this thing was discovered all over the world .
But I knew this , in the church , the weddings are added .
In Gujarat a woman here gave tea only to the people coming in her marriage .
Once I saw in the bathrooms of TV , when late at night I was watching , this name of Dhakiyajuli in Assam is a small village .
Now when he got a bribe of 20000 rupees, what did he do
Around , four women from the neighborhood came together and they bought together in the market and paid money using a boat of 20000 rupees .
See how changes are happening in the life of the beggar .
Or some people of Mohima have benefited immediately .
What to say , then I got information in small city .
Such information was found from around 40 - 50 cities , or because of the closure of the nose the old ones who left them , did not give money to the people .
Not only does the money of Karachi , Panipatti , window , and we know that poor men fall on going two days before .
Those big people who are not , those who are familiar with whom they knew that they would never think , they do not give money and they stay very tired of it .
Jametam 50 percent deposits on the income of taxes to every municipality .
But at this time due to the decision of 8 stars all the people fled to collect their old nose .
Last year a tax of about three-seven thousand crore rupees was deposited in the 47 urban department .
We will be surprised to hear and joy also , in one week they have a collection of 13 thousand crore rupees .
But I enjoy the fields of my country today .
I used to take care of the production of pucca in this season .
The farmers have also discovered the way after coming in trouble .
The government has also taken several important decisions in which fields and villages have been given priority .
Small traders of our country send employment and help in increasing economic situation .
In the last economy we took an important decision . Like the largest mall , now small shopkeepers in the village will also be able to do their business 24 hours . Doesn ' t they stop any deal , I think , big buildings get 24 hours , then don ' t the poor in the village
Through the medium of Mudra plan they were taken forward to give them energy .
But due to this decision it also becomes natural for them to face problems .
I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance to enter the digital world as well .
We also download the powder of our mobile phones of the banks , we also keep POS for credit cards .
Learn what kind of business can happen without using small .
We see , the way in which we increase our business through the medium of thick malls , technique , a small businessman or general user can increase our business because of ' Friendly Technology ' .
There is no such possibility of some badness and there is a chance to increase .
I invite you to create cassalas society i . . to create a rockless system we can give a lot of contribution .
There are ways of technology , safe , trustworthy and busy .
I believe , I want to tell the adventurous , painful brothers and sisters properly , you have lost yourself .
But friends , you are my true soldier , guardian .
There is a unique opportunity to serve the mother of India in front of us and the country has got a chance to give it a chance to the economic peak .
The more we have experience the older this world is not the same .
We do not know what we used to do beforehand .
We know how online banking , online ticket booking or how it happens .
There is nothing special in it .
But the great work that the country wants to do today , which is dreaming , castles society , it is true that 100 percent we will not be successful but do not start .
If we start the cashless society then the goal is not removed .
Wallet means e-packet.
Several types of cards are available .
Under the reproductive program of India Kotikoti is a card for poor families .
But after 8 stars poor people started using cards as well but their use has increased by about 300 percent .
Just as you get prepaid cards for mobile phones and you get prepaid cards to spend money in the bank .
This work is so easy as we send Whatsupe .
It is necessary for the uneducated person to forward a good Whatsoever case .
Not only this , technicalisation is so easy that for this work the solution of smart phone is not necessary .
Whether it is washing , vegetable seller , milk seller , or the seller of present leaf or tea , everyone can use it .
I have stressed to make this system more easy .
All the banks are working on it .
And in the last two-four days we will be able to read in the present utensils only after removing the huge quantity of cards used .
The technique which you want to spend online will be in your mobile phone .
Not only this , by removing half an hour , two hours everyday we tell at least ten families what is technology , how is the use of technology  How can we download our bank
We have to do this very leadership of the campaign to free our country from corruption , campaign , to free people from problems , to get rid of problems , to get rid of this cassette societies from cleanliness .
If the normal citizens learn this system then perhaps they will get relief from work contemplation and in this work if all the youths in Hindustan bow themselves then it will not take a long time , but I think .
Within a month we can stand as modern Hindus in the world .
And we can do this work through mobile phones and we can go to ten houses everyday .
Let me invite you , let us not only stop by giving support , we will be soldiers of change and show changes .
In order to free the country from corruption and black money we fought this war ahead .
And there are many such countries in the world where new youths there have changed their national life and they are from the youth .
M-Pesa has built a mobile system determined by the country of Kenya . used technology , M-Pesa named it .
There has been a big revolution in this country .
My young men, I'm inspiring again, he's not the campaign ahead.
I invite you to work in school, colleges, university, NCC, NSS, collectively, personally.
The most popular artist of this century Amitabhaji is moving ahead with the heart of cleanliness .
It seems impossible that cleanliness is very good in their nervous system and therefore giving their father ' s glory they will remember the work of cleansing .
He writes a poem of Harivansh dynasty , one of them , one sword of earth , a charming life of fun , my identity - Harivansh dynasty or through his own identity .
If my beloved countrymen , then through my mind , my thoughts , my feelings , my emotions , my grandsons , on my mother ' s gove , on my narrow modi ' s feet I have joined me forever .
At 11 p . m . ki Baat program is broadcast but we will soon hear its translation from regional languages .
In every corner of India Diwali is celebrated with happiness and enthusiasm .
India is such a country where 365 days of the year some or the other festival is celebrated somewhere in the country .
Festival is the second name of the life of Indians , which will see anyone from far away and that is natural .
Till date the tradition of Indian festivals has changed in accordance with this period .
Only one thing is remembered in all these journeys that this entire journey of the fair festivals in India , its expansion , its prosperity , its effect on the masses is connected to a fundamental mantra .
The objective behind this is to expand personality and personality , to expand the circumstance of our limited thoughts from society to Brahmins and to do all these work through festivals .
If you take the diet included in the common festivals in India then how is the weather in it as well , what kind of diet should be taken in which season , what kind of diet should the farmers take , what kind of dishes should be included in the festivals of picnic , what kind of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of varieties of varieties of varieties of variety of varieties of varieties of variety of variety of varieties of varieties of varieties of varieties of varieties of varieties of varieties of varieties of varieties of varieties
Today the whole world is talking about the environment .
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern .
The tradition of Indian Festival is merely giving a message to everyone from young boys to young boys increasing the love of nature .
Whether trees , plants , rivers , animals , mountains or birds , we celebrate the festival of creating a spirit of patience towards each .
Hall we take holidays on Sunday , only the old square , the square square , the square square , the square square , the square used to take holidays on all the days of Amavasya and Poornima .
This is not the blindness occurring due to lack of light but it is also the blindness of blindness .
This is the attempt to overcome the defects of the society , the blindness of the person , the deficiency of the person , and to bring out the light of positiveness by lighting the divinely built day with the same idea .
The utensils of the house of the poor are real , but they look clean , shiny in the days of Diwali .
From that point of view on the day is a pleasure of cleanliness .
Not only at home but cleaning of the entire area , cleaning of the villages , cleaning of the entire village is needed today .
With that recommendation we should expand this aspect of cleanliness .
This festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India .
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world .
Many governments around the world want to participate in the festival of the Parliament and Administrative Diwali .
You may know that Tupal Save of America has done this year 's Deepawali-made Tupal ticket , this may be known .
The patriotisms of Canada have also shoved their photographs on the Twitter of the day of Diwali .
The ancestors of Britain organised a magnificent program to gather all the newly formed society in London and they also joined themselves in it .
Diwali is not celebrated with great enthusiasm , no such city is in Britain .
What is the picture of the photographs that the fathers of Singapore have kept on Instagram and have been decreed with the honor of the whole world
While 16 women of the Singapore border are standing outside the Indian Sadiya Nesu river .
He told me that as soon as the patriotism of New ealand had come here , we have to return to New ealand to participate in the party of the day .
This festival of light of Deepawali is also being celebrated with the blindness of the world community as a festival of inspiration from the blindness towards the light .
In the festival of Diwali along with new clothes and various tasty food items , thick sweets are played with interest .
Walking small children and young boys is liked from mind .
Sometimes little children do not only enthusiastically , they enjoy many fomentations together and invite many foolish problems by trying to make a big noise at one time .
What are the things of our neighborhood , there is a possibility of burning , it does not even remember .
In the days of Diwali due to this kind of accidents , fire brimstone , abduction of abduction is a matter of concern .
During the days of Diwali many doctors also have a lot of time to celebrate Diwali with their families .
The festival of Diwali goes on for a long time in our country .
On celebrating the festival of Deepavali we also prepare for Chhathpuja .
The festival of Chhathpuja in the eastern part of India is very big , this festival considered to be the festival runs for four days .
This festival gives a very big meaningful message to the society .
From whatsoever the Sun God gives us all we get , it is difficult to show what we get from the pure and protective Sun God .
Chhath Puja is the festival of the serpentine of the sun .
It is said that people in the world worship the sun rising .
Only sixth priest is such a festival in which the sun is also worshipped .
Through that also a big social message is given .
In my emotions there is always a feeling of thanks towards the sacrifice , penance and hard work of the soldiers of the Sainyam soldiers and from the same point of view came in my mind that the Deepavali of Yand should be dedicated to these security forces .
I invited the countrymen to contact Solugers or Mohammad .
There is no feeling of immense love , glory and respect towards the people of the country , such people will not be able to gain in India , I want to say that today .
The way this feeling has become impossible , therefore every citizen has been shown to be a fast power .
Through the messages of all of us the soldiers of our security forces have got new patience and new standing .
There is no direction to the citizens of our country , no such thing has been given , no school , college , students , villages , poor , businessmen , shopkeepers , state leadership , players , actresses , all of them have expressed their feelings .
This Deepotsav has been considered as a chance of expressing unpleasant thanks .
Today we celebrate Diwali while some Jawan is standing in the desert , some are on the peaks of the Himalayan , some are protecting the industries while some are watching the security of the airport , all these people are crossing innumerous pockets .
I can imagine how much this is a moment of respect for the people of my country .
Innumerous feelings have been expressed in the opposite way on the message to solvers ' hashtag .
Ashvinikumar Chouhan has sent a poem , which seemed to me reading at this time .
I speak Shivani Mohan .
On this day on the occasion of ' To Solajers ' the message which we started gets great encouragement to our fountain buildings .
My elder and mother-in-law both were occupied in the army .
Our entire family is full of soldiers .
We have many princes in the Army Circular on the border of the country who are getting very good messages and through that they get great encouragement .
Together with the princes and jewels of Sania their entire family , their wife also commits a lot of excitement , it seems to me to be surely telling me .
Through our messages the entire community is getting a very good message and I also want to give you the glimpse of Diwali .
Whether there is natural danger , whether there is a problem in maintaining law and sustainability , whether it is doing two hands with enemies or the dress of bringing back young men going through wrong ways - our young people are working on being inspired by the nation ' s feeling on every horse of life .
I was told about one hour , that I would like to tell you as well , what thing can be inspired to do successfully , it seems to me or tell me .
Among the security forces we have a population of ITBP , development is Thakur , he is a resident of Chotayasa village of Sirmaur district of Himachal .
The name of his village is Badhana .
We had gone to our village in the holidays of ITBP .
That is why Himachal Pradesh has been able to become a free state of open defecation .
A lot of people go to those villages .
In this place the engineering students of the city staying a little away from that village of no toilet were remembered .
The students of NCC , members of NSS and engineers decided to build a toilet in this village .
All the goods , vita , cement and all the other essential babes used to build the toilet were driven out on their shoulders , after finishing the whole day till that village .
After working automatically the toilet was built in that village and these youths showed a small village of the remote part of the forest free of open defecation .
That is why Kerala is going to be an open toilet free state .
Gujarat has declared all municipal municipalities , more than 150 places to be open toilet free .
100 districts have been opened toilets .
There is a good news of happiness from Haryana . On 1 November Haryana is celebrating its golden festival and they have decided to open their state in some months .
Till now 7 districts there have become free of open defecation .
Work is going on fast in all the states .
I have mentioned only some states .
In all these states about the participation of the citizens in this campaign and in order to remove the blindness in the form of unsafeness of the country I enjoy their hearts very much .
My beloved countrymen , there are many plans of the government , after the first plan they have to stop the first plan after presenting such a second plan .
Normally nobody is able to pay attention to these things .
While starting the old plan , new plans are also being started , these plans are recommended and they keep on running continuously .
The houses in our country where gas is used for sustenance , those houses where there is wetness there is no need of kerosene .
He has taken a big decision to free kerosene from Haryana state .
The way they have taken this work , seeing that Haryana will soon be free from kerosene .
Only the mediators and the parties will be subjected to it .
My dear countrymen , Mahatma Gandhiji has always been a guide for all of us .
It is necessary to pay attention to the important concerns created in the minds of the poor in the country .
To get out of contact we have to take one step from one side .
Whatever is your old thinking , the distinction between the son and the daughter should be destroyed in society .
Now there are free management houses for children and girls in schools .
This is the opportunity of giving our girls the experience of distinction free India .
The blindness should be spread in the village even after roaming for one and a half centuries , it is not right .
In order to free such villages from blindness quickly the desire to reach there is being successfully achieved .
Successful efforts are being made to give smoke free life to five crore families .
All such people who run small traders , flyers , vegetable sellers , milk sellers , bath shops were stuck in the bad circle of public business .
Many people have got rid of this bad chakra of business by the medium plan , stand up plan , eating public money .
Direct money is deposited in banks through base , so that they reach directly to the beneficiaries .
This is an opportunity to free the life of the common man from mediators and parties .
My beloved countrymen , it is 31 October , which has dedicated their lives for the unity of India , the great man of this country Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is a glimpse .
There is a glimpse of Sardar Patel in 31 stars , this will be comfortable .
Sardar Patel took away his entire life to connect the country and he became successful in his love , he brought everyone together .
At the same time Durdeva did this , on the same day Indira Gandhiji was excused .
We all know the incident that happened in the country after their activity .
Sir , I feel as if what can be done to prevent such a rare incident
My dear countrymen , this is not just the sorrow of one person .
After Chanakya Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has given a literary history of the great work of uniting the country .
This injustice done on the heads of the birth day of that great man who lived for unity is painful for all of us in history .
Just take care of all these problems and we have to go ahead with the mantra of unity .
The unity of diversity , this is the strength of the country .
Whether there are many languages , many penances , many types of diets , only oneness of diversity is the strength of India , specialty of India , responsibility of every generation .
It is the responsibility of every government to find out the opportunity of establishing unity in every corner of the country and establish unity .
It is important to escape from the thoughts , nature and also to save the country .
Sardar Saheb has given us an India , it is our responsibility to make it a better India .
The original mantra of unit makes a strong footprint of the best India .
Seeing the union of the farmers the life of Sardar Saheb started .
Only Sardar Saheb took the lead not only for the Sangharsha but also for the creative work .
I offer honorably reverence to Sardar Saheb and on 31 October everyday we recall them wherever we are , conclude unity .
Kartik Purnima is a festival of light in this series of my dear countrymen , Diwali .
Guru Nanak Dev and his learning - direction is a guide not only for India but also for the entire human species .
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev .
Peace unity and goodwill were their chief minister .
From every learning of Guru Nanak Dev the fame of liberating the society from differentiation , blindness and misery has been put forward .
At the time when such disorders had reached the extreme boundary of specific - untouchable , caste system , high - low disorders , at that time Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhi Lalo as his co - operative .
Come , let us take along the mantra of good guru Nanak Devji , who is inspiring to do the work of resistance , inspiring to release the light of knowledge and distinction .
My beloved countrymen , once again dedicated to the names of the soldiers of the country or celebrated Diwali , we all have a very good wish .
Woe to your dreams , your complications fulfilment , spend your life in happiness , in dry-sports , this is my favoriteness to all of you .
My dear countrymen, we're all bowing down.
We embraced the eighth gallantry of our country in the rigorous hall that occurred in the Uri department of Jammu and Kashmir .
My dear countrymen , there is complete faith in our sanctuary .
He will fool every such bitterness and will fulfil the efforts of the world to live hundreds of millions of people with happiness .
But Sanya Dal does not speak .
Today I want to speak specially to the citizens of Kashmir .
Now the citizens of Kashmir have started to recognize the anti-national powers .
And as the truth has begun to know them , they have started waiting on the path of peace separateing themselves from such thoughts .
Every parents feel that schools and colleges will be working faster and faster .
Farming industries like goods , fruits made in the fields go to the market plates throughout India .
It seems that economic behavior is easy .
And for the past few days this behavior has started getting simple .
For our future generations new peaks of development have to bear us .
We can find out the solution of every problem together , take out the way and propagate the best way for the future generation of Kashmir , I believe it .
The security of the citizens between Kashmir is the responsibility of the government .
In order to maintain law and prosperity government has to take some steps .
I get a chance to know a lot of holes through Soshal Midia .
In every part of India , every kind of people get an opportunity to understand the feelings and feelings and feelings and this gives strength to the public .
The young man named Harshvardhan who learned in Akravi etc . had a different idea in front of me .
Then I envisage that I practiced three hours more daily.
It is a very useful citizen of the country .
Harishvardhan Bhau , in the environment , in such a small age you can think like a peaceful mind , it seems to me joy .
But Harshvardhan , I also want to say that the development in the minds of the citizens of the country is very much price .
That is the symbol of the consciousness of the nation .
This emotion shows the determination to show something .
Everyone feels like doing something or the other .
At that time Lal Bahadur Scientist tried to touch this emotion of the country in a very good way .
And Jai Jawan - Jai Kishan had inspired the common man in the country to work for the country by giving this mantra .
One more way of expressing patriotism in the voices of Bombay and Bunkers is towards every citizen , which has been shown by the red light scientists .
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
Kartik has written on Narendra Modi Pass that , the history of his thugs that went for the competition of paralysis , is the victory of human consciousness .
Shriman Varun Vishwanathan has written on Narendra Modi Pavat that he has done a very good job of his theatre . We should mention it in the mother of the mind .
Not just we are both , but every person in the country has been associated with an emotional native among his players among paralysis .
Going ahead of sports , these paralympics and their players have made a complete change in the point of view of humanity , the point of view of view of Divyagan .
And I , my victorious sister Deepa Malik can not forget what he said .
When he asked the medal then he said that this medal has defeated my disability only .
There is a lot of strength in this devotion .
This time along with three women in our country along with paralysis 19 athletes were included .
In comparison to other games , when Divyang plays , then physical capacity , fashion of game is even bigger than this , T . . will power , synthesis power .
We will be surprised to hear this that our players gained four posts while doing the best work today , two golden , one rope and one bronze medal .
Devender Jhajharia gaining gold medal made another independent gold medal in Bhalafakita .
And he was not uncomfortable at birth , because of the shock of the window he had to lose one hand .
Let us think , which man simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously .
Maryuppan Thangvelu has zinced gold medal in a high jumping type .
They are not living in some big city or even in the middle class Shrimant house .
Till one and a half years of age , despite physical hardships by sucking a painful life , he will get the country a medal on the strength of the composition .
Thalit Deepa Malik did a lot of time in breaking the window .
Varun C.
The furnace squeezed the bronze medal in a high jumping type .
It is very less people who know what the people of this Divyang have done in Paralimbiques program this time .
Not only this , I wondered when I came to know that in comparison to running among the players I would not get medals at number four , but in comparison to the strong runners he completed the race in less than the player receiving gold medal .
I enjoy all these sportsmen , and in the coming time India is moving forward towards making a sufficient plan for its development .
My dear countrymen , in the last week I realized many wonderful experiences in the new year of Gujarat .
If there was a big emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibir for Divya people and many world heritages were recorded at that time .
Who can not see this world . Gauri Shardul and that had come from the remote forest of Nang district , the entire Ramayana is in the form of poetry .
And when I heard the people accumulated there , then people were amazed .
On that day I got the opportunity to inaugurate a book .
This experiment has been recorded in the Ginniz Book of World Record .
On the same day it is a matter of pride of being three - third world class from Divya Man .
My dear countrymen , two years ago we started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the Jayanti day of worshipping fathers on October 2 .
And on the same day I had told that cleanliness should be the habit of being done . Every citizen should be able to do this , the environment of surroundings should be prepared about unsafeness .
Now when two years are completed on October 2 , then I can tell with confidence that awareness of cleanliness has increased in hundreds of crores of people .
And I had said - one step towards cleanliness and today we can tell everyone that everyone has tried to move forward one powder .
And therefore everybody , whether it is normal citizen , ruler , government office or road , bus station or railway station , school or college , religious place or hospital , from small children , from very small citizens , rural poor , farmer woman , everybody gives some contribution to cleanliness .
The friends of the middle have also crossed a positive role .
My desire is that we should go ahead .
This is also important , and therefore if rural India has to say , then till date two crore two and a half million toilets have been built .
In the States , districts and districts , a competition has been started in the villages and villages .
Andhra Pradesh , Gujarat and Kerala will get complete success in the campaign free of hostility .
Do this those who work , enjoy them , and those who are trying for them .
And I have instructed the countrymen , for the honor of parents , for the health of children , we have to free the country from this problem .
Or we go ahead with this composition.
Especially for my young friends , who use a lot of hole technology , I want to present a plan for them .
By making a phone call on this number of 1969 we can know the situation of building a toilet in our city , along with it we can also ask for the construction of a toilet .
We take a lot of benefit from it , specially the young woman should take advantage of it .
The Government of India has also warned the corporate sector to come forward .
He should give sponsorship to young businessmen who want to work for cleanliness .
They can be sent to the district as a representative of Swachh Bharat Mohammad .
Buy the fault which is prepared from waste , such faulty products have been told .
The farmers who do central farming have been asked to provide them the property .
It has been said that those who have to improve the health of our land , those who take care of the health of the earth , those who have been harmed due to the use of chemical treasures have been given this amount as necessary .
And Mrs . Amitab Bachanji is giving special contribution in this work as a clean messenger .
West to Welth , I am inviting youth to start a new start up in this area of wealth from the market , to develop machine museums for that , develop mechanism .
This is definitely an act of doing .
This year during 25 September to 3 October a special program of Indonesian , Indian Sainitation Conference is being organised .
The ministers of the country , chief ministers , mayors of the metropolitan cities , together , are doing deep thinking about cleanliness and cleanliness only .
What can be the technology
What can be the cost of economic dharna
How can the part of the world be achieved
How can the chances of employment be produced in this
There is a discussion on all these subjects .
I have seen , new settlements are coming continuously about cleanliness .
As soon as I had read in the present utensils the students of Gujarat Treatment University went to a hundred seven villages and conducted awareness campaign for the construction of the toilet .
He made himself difficult and gave him the contribution to build nearly 900 toilets .
As soon as we saw this also , under the leadership of Wing Commander Parmvir Singh , from Devprayag to Ganga sea 2800 kilometres away in the character of a path Ganga swimming and he gave a message of cleanliness .
Different departments of the Government of India have made their daily sights .
Every department pays attention to cleanliness by deciding fifteen days .
In the coming October the Ministry of Drinking Water and Cleanliness , Panchayat State Department , Rural Development Department are collecting and preparing camps for cleaning in their respective areas .
And in the last two weeks of the month of October , in the period of 16 to 31 October , the Ministry of Agriculture and Pharmaceutical Welfare , Food Processing Department and the Ministry of Grahk Welfare , the three departments will run their cleaning campaign in the respective areas .
I observe the citizens , we also participate in the department with which we have a respected relation .
We must have seen that surveys are done about hall cleansing .
Before surveying in 73 cities what is the situation of cleaning there , it has been asked before the people of the country .
Now this work will be done in about 500 cities with more than one lakh population .
Because the citizens of every city feel like we are back in this , let us show something better now .
There is a radical environment for cleanliness .
I hope that we will give our contribution to all citizens .
On the coming of October two days Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri are celebrated .
From Gandhi Jayanti to Divali we are enjoying buying fertilizers .
At this time also I have to say that in our family there is only one thing of khadi which can apply Diwali in the poor house .
Or on October 2, a citizen, can we join ourselves in the pursuit of cleanliness
Two hours , four hours , we take a part in the work of cleaning , and I tell you that take out one photo of it , take a photo of it and sheer it on the narrow modi .
If you have a widow then shear a widow.
Seeing your efforts will get new power in the country or in the world , new speed will be achieved .
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Scientists we made a plan to do something for the country .
The joy of giving life to my loved countrymen , is different .
And the retaliation that he received can be called a great motivational event in the national life of India .
Many young , small institutions of our country , people , students , public organizations in the corporate sector together are celebrating the Joy of Giving Wick , in many cities of the country from October 2 to 8 October .
It is its preference to bring food items , clothes together to the needy people .
Seeing that player on the face of those poor children some sort of joy came out .
In the cities where this Joy of Giving is being celebrated , we want to encourage those youths , I feel like helping them .
My beloved countrymen , today 25 September , Pondicherry , Jayanti of Dayal Upadhya and their birth centenary year is starting today .
Millions of workers like me have done the work of explaining the state ideals which are working with the state ideals .
On the other side of the queen connected with the roots of India he gave Mandali to the ideal system reversing the cultural tradition of India .
The birth centenary year of such pundit daily sub-division is being started today .
This is the principle of the untouchability of everybody Hindu and everybody .
Mahatma Gandhi also speaks about the interest of every person in the lapse .
How will the fruits of development reach the poorest person
He used to work every hand and water to every field , in this two words the entire economic arch .
On the day of my beloved countrymen , on the day of Vijayadashmi , two years before today , I started it with my mind .
During the completion of two years the way we gave the blessings of this activity , for this I consider the blessings of all the best .
I also consider Akashwani as a blessing , because he did not only propagate the mind , but also worked from all the regional languages to reach the worlds .
Those slaves who stole the doors of the government by writing the utensils , showing the flaws of the government ' s work , also consider them as a grief . Akashwani has made the monastery available to solve the problems of the people by speaking to the government officials .
That is why the heartbeat has not been translated only for fifteen - twenty minutes , it has become a chance of social change .
What could be the thing that gives greater pleasure than this to anyone .
How will the festival connecting humans and humans happen .
And that will be the means of the powerful strength and then we all come together and celebrate the festival of victory .
Or take the means of power, take the mantra of one another.
To celebrate the nation with peace , unity , goodwill , celebrated the celebration of Navaratri and Durgapuja , celebrated Vijaya Dashmi .
Pt . President Narendra Modi translated from Akashwani to the sandalwood of the mind .
My dear countrymen , on 29 August Hockey 's magical day is the birth day of Dhyanchand .
This day is celebrated in the form of national sports day throughout the country .
I pay tribute to Dhyanchandji and therefore he also wants to remember the contribution made by him .
In 1928 , 1932 , 1936 he played an important role in providing hockey gold medal to India in alignment game .
We know the name of Bradman for all cricket lovers .
My countrymen , as soon as the time of mind starts coming closer , information of many kinds starts coming on the microscopic or nervous mood .
Besides crickets , other games in Indians are so impossible , so aware , so much aware .
Give me this message, yakarta made it a source of inspiration.
Sachin says , Definitely speak about the Indus , Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the voice of this time .
We got the post, she got it from the girls.
Our girls have justified this , we are not less than Kunal .
One of these girls is from North India , one from South India , one from East India and another from India .
That is why it seems as if these girls from all over the country have raised the name of India .
Mai Gwawar peak Thakur writes , we can work better than this in Alimpi .
He says , respectable modi sir first enjoying getting two posts in Rio .
But I want to take care of it , did my work really better
And the answer is, no
We need to put a long tail in the creed area .
Our parents fill our studies even today .
Society also believes that sports is a disorder of time .
We can not work according to our necessity , we can not ignore it .
In some cases it has been said that the players who used to do good work in India , the work they used to do in the sports here could not show there and only two posts were found in the medal style .
One more thing is true , if you do not get posts , then you will know that first time Indian sportsmen have shown some better duties in the external game .
Inside seeing this itself , his innovation Bindaji stayed at the fourth place in Nambaji , and got medal in a very less context .
The same thing happened in Tennis , Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna couple .
After Usha , in 32 years Lalita Babar first became eligible for the last journey of Track Field .
After 36 years the woman reached the hockey team alimbique , we will definitely be happy to see this .
In the last 36 years , first time the hockey union of men got success in reaching the nock camel fare .
Our union is strong and part of the grief is that Argentina - those who received golden drinkers , who were those who served them together in the entire struggle
The work of some players would have been good , such as Aditya Ashoka , Dattu Bhoknal , Atnu Das .
My countrymen , we have to do a lot but if we continue to do anything , and do something then you will be disappointed again .
I have declared a committee .
This committee of the Government of India will do adventurous exercises .
What can we do better , this will make the arch committee of Babat .
We have to plan from a distance of 2020 , 2024 , 2028 .
I am also the leader of state governments to establish such units , what can we do in the field of Krida , what can our one state do , states like one or two games and consider how much strength we can show in that game .
We make all the preparations and I believe that we achieve the best situation in the world with a population of 65 percent of our countrymen with a hundred crore countrymen .
This complication has to wait for the future .
Deshbandhano, September 5 teacher day
For some years I have given time with the students with the invitation of the teacher day and I used to spend time being a student of them .
I also learned a lot from these students .
This was the teacher day on 5th September for me and not the day of education.
That is why there is such a thought in mind that my feelings should be expressed in the mind .
The place of mother in life is also the place of teachers .
Even such a teacher I see more than myself who have more concern of our human beings .
They live their lives for the disciples , students .
Nowadays after Rio alimbique , there is a discussion of Pulela Gopichand everywhere .
They are playing games , but how is the best teacher , they have presented its example .
The contribution of teachers in the life of all of us is always felt .
On 5th September , the birth day of Maji President Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan of India and the whole country considers this day as a teacher day .
Although he reached any place in his life he tried to live in the middle of the teacher himself .
Because he writes in such beautiful handicrafts and my own character is very bad .
So who has seen good handcuffs , that respect increases in my mind .
If we have a photo with our teachers on Narendra Modi Pass , it will be good memory , inspirational thing , then we must be careful .
Keep in mind , seeing the contribution of the teachers from the point of view of the students , it would be valuable for us .
Deshbandhano, Ganeshotsav will come in a few days.
Ganeshji is a madman and all of us feel that their country , their society , their family , every person , their life is uninterrupted .
When we consider the Ganeshotsav then it is natural to come to the memory of Lokmanya Tilak .
The tradition of public Ganeshotsav is given to Lokmanya Tilaks .
Through this the creation of programs is such that society gets new inspiration , new light along with this the health given by them is my birthplace , and then I will get it at the center .
Even today not only in Maharashtra but also in the corners of Hindustan Ganeshotsav started taking place .
There are discussions on public topics , competitive competitions , competitions are held .
In that way social topics are touched from the artistic demolition .
The campaign of a kind of public education starts as if through the Ganesha festival , Lokmanya Tillaks gave us this inspirational mantra .
Now we have our right , we have waited towards Suraj , can we not give the message of this mantra to Suraj as our prince
I am inviting you .
This thing is true that festival is the power of society .
Because of the festival new mood comes in the individual and society .
Besides the festival life is impossible but it is necessary to change it according to the desire of time .
This time I have come to know that some people , especially Ganeshotsav , Durgapuja , have written a lot and they are worried about the environment .
The statues made from POP are not suitable to the environment .
This pain has been told fast as he has told by others as well .
I pray to all of us , like ancient times use the idol of Shadow goddess Ganesha and Durga goddess and do not follow your ancient tradition .
The protection of sanctuary , the protection of our river pond , the protection of small creatures from pollution this is the god service in a way .
I do not know what kind of attitude we will take these problems from me , I do not tell them alone but this is the opinion of many .
According to some it was known that the sculptor of Pune Abhit Dhondfale , the organization of Colombopur - Nisarg Mitra , Science Prabodhini
Environment lover also Ganeshotsav - This is also a social worker .
There is a lot of time for Durga Puja .
Ganesh Chaturthi gives us great pleasure to all of us .
My beloved countrymen , Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be declared on 4th September with the title of Santa .
Mother Teresa had dedicated his entire life to the servants of the poor of India .
Those who serve the poor of India forever , such mother Terresa gets a regular title , then it is natural for all Indians to feel respected .
This festival will be held on 4th September , under the leadership of the Government of India , the Representative Board of the officers under the leadership of the state minister Sushma Swaraj .
When my dear countrymen , development becomes a mass movement then there is a big change .
Mankind is the form of God .
In the last few days the Indian government made a successful attempt to bring people together for clean Ganga , clean Ganga with the help of five state governments .
On this month twenty Tarakhe of Allahabad village headquarters of the Ganges coast have been invited here .
All these chiefs about coming here to Allahabad for this composition - if someone comes from Uttarakhand , Uttar Pradesh , Bihar then someone comes from Jharkhand , West Bengal , I lure everyone .
I enjoy all the ministers of the Government of India - those who have fulfilled this imagination .
I also congratulate the chief ministers of that five state that they have taken a certain step in the direction of the cleanliness of the Ganges bringing together the people .
Somebody wrote from English to Hindi, then somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh, 'We have to go to the toilet in our house.
He asked for the construction of toilet .
Some children have written this that this year if my growth is not celebrated then they will run , but definitely make the toilet .
This work was done by these children of seven to seven years .
It had so much effect and emotional consequences that on going to school the next day , to give the teachers , the parents wrote a letter and it was very surprising that we should make a toilet in the house till a star .
Those who have also imagined this imagination , who tried for that , have also taken a special pleasure of the students and the palanquins that they decided to make a toilet by waking up their minds very hard .
Or a daughter-in-law of sixteen years of age in the district - this daughter-in-law has called Satyagrah in her family .
And the privilege of Mohammad the chief of the village , and the sword ,
He deposited eighteen thousand rupees and made a toilet within a week .
My dear countrymen , clean India has dreamed of every Indian .
Some Indians have this composition .
Some Indians have made their point of view .
But everybody has not been connected in that form , everybody gives some or the other contribution .
Everyday patience keeps coming . What do you try
The Government of India gave thoughts , encouraged the people , we made a film on cleanliness for two-three minutes . This small sent to the Government of India .
I tell the TV drivers that we also fill such a competition .
The imagination of new buildings can also give strength to cleanliness campaign .
We have our invitation . countrymen , India always have relations with neighboring countries , such has always been desired .
Only , this is not the channel of general radio , it is an important step .
Your neighborhood is Bangladesh .
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are connected today with the same cultural tradition .
They will contact each other and will enjoy the imagination of imagination and the Bengali language people of both sides will enjoy the sky .
Akashwani has a big contribution towards the contact with the people of the world .
The president inaugurated this channel .
For this program worked with us , respect of Bangladesh .
I also wish to all the friends of the sky , they also give their contribution in the traditional dharna .
My beloved countrymen , we have given me the smoke of the post of prime minister , in the end I am a human like myself .
Sometimes emotional events touch me more .
Some such emotional incidents also give new power , inspiration as well and by this I also get inspiration to do something or the other for Indian people .
A 84-year-old mother-in-law is a nutritious teacher - she wrote me a grandson .
Do not declare my name , even though I have told you , it seems like mind .
In a letter, he said, we did the instruction of leaving gas grants, at the same time left the grant... and then I forgot it.
Just a few days ago someone came to one of his men and gave me a leaf in which Give it up to me blessings.
For me this leaf of the fathers of India is not less than Padmasri .
The people of the country who left the subsidy on the gas of kitchen tried to give them a leaf , somebody would give my representative to the leaf .
My attempt is to give more than one crore people a leaf .
They wrote to me , You are doing a good job . Your campaign to get rid of the smoke of poor mothers and I am a destitute teacher , my age will be new in a few years .
I am sending a penny of fifty thousand rupees from which the poor mothers will get rid of the smoke of chicken , bring them to use .
We know that a mother giving adrenal breeding from a general teacher 's definition statement , when 50 thousand rupees gives birth to the gas connecting of poor mothers . question is not of fifty thousand rupees .
The question is of that mother ' s feeling , this is the blessing of Koti Mata - grandmothers , from which the faith of my country keeps on increasing .
He did not write this letter to me by this mother of Pantpraad , but wrote the Sadhasudha Patri - Modi Bhaiyya .
In some parts of the country there has been frequent situation .
The extent to which the state government , central government , local health institutions , social institutions can be assisted by the citizens .
In August 2001, the parties with state opposition, the parties who do not give any opportunity against each other, or all the state birds, together with GST legitimately celebrated.
Its credit goes to all the state birds and if all the birds start moving together then how big work was done , this is an example .
Similarly , with regard to that situation which happened in Kashmir , all the state birds of the country together put a voice issue .
Those people who try to make these small children symptoms by making them symptoms , afterwards they will have to answer it sometimes or the other innocent children .
My dear countrymen , the country is big , differently narrow .
Bounding this country with diversity in the bond of unity , citizens or maternal , society , government is the responsibility of all this maternal grandeur , that we give strength to the things that bury unity and only then the future will glow in the country .
I have complete faith in the power of my father-in-law Koti .
Today morning I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for some time and I believe that in the next days the color of sports in the entire country will color every youth in the color of enthusiasm and hope .
Everyone knows that in some days there is a great gain of playing in the whole world .
Rio ' this name is going to be repeated in our ears .
Your hopes are very much , but the work of exciting the confidence of those players who have gone to play in Rio is of hundreds of crores of people in the country .
We should also do something or the other to encourage our players from where you are in the coming days .
The player who reaches till the Olympics reaches there only after hard work .
This is a kind of hard test .
Jinging and losing are important , but along with reaching that game , it is more important than that , and therefore give all the players who have gone to the countrymen Rio Olympics adventure , adventure .
Today I am speaking about Rio alimbique , a poem lover - the student of Punjab Central University Suraj Prakash teaches a poem .
Many of us are poets , who have written poems , maybe write poems , some people will also do that voice , in every language , but the poem that is sent by the sun is sharing with you .
Under this young man has reminded me of the death anniversary of Maji President Abdul Kalamji .
Throughout the country and the world , they are revered , but when the name of absurd artists comes then the words of science , technology , Missile come and future support comes in front of India ' s pictures and therefore the figures have written that what is your government doing to fulfill the dream of absurd artism
Your saying is right .
And if we have to go with it or go ahead then we should reconstruct and innovation meaning renovation and both of these things are the life of technology .
If there is no amendment , renovation then the way accumulated water produces bad odour , similarly technologicalness also keeps on becoming a loose one .
If we stay alive without amendment , renovation then we have taken some steps to create a new piece of science ' s attraction , amendment for technology and its sweetness in this new generation and therefore I say that we should keep the aim of renovate to this modern , changing age .
And if I say Let us to innovate, then my AIM means.
In the school where such tincture labs will be constructed , they can be given 10 lakh rupees and for taking care of them for five years one lakh rupees are given .
At the same time on the other hand India is bowing down with many problems .
In everyday life we get to see problems , problems .
Now we need to find answers based on technology .
Through Atal Grand Challenges we have conveyed the youth of the country that if we see problems , problems , then find them through technology , amend them , renovate them and bring them to us .
The Government of India is looking forward to promoting you by giving special awards to the technology that has been administered on problems , difficulties and I am enjoying that people are interested in this when we told about Tinkering Labs .
My beloved countrymen , some days ago Amma was also worried about the bad times , these days the joy of rains is enjoying , but the swords of pimples are also coming .
The state government and the central government are doing a lot of work by putting hand on the shoulders to help the afflicted victims .
Even after some problems due to rains the mind of everyone becomes happy , human mind gets happy because the center of our entire economic upheaval is binding and its ongoing farming .
Sometimes such diseases occur that we have to repent throughout the life .
But if we stay alert , stay alert , stay alert then the way to escape from it becomes easy .
W . . sees awakening but sometimes we are slightly sad in the context of work .
Government , hospital , doctor , this will do our work , but we do not enter the dengue in our house , our family , therefore , stay aware of not getting any disease from water , I regret it .
Toward another crisis loved countrymen want to take care of themselves .
Today life has become very fast , due to continuous running we do not get time to think about ourselves .
If you feel sick then you will recover soon and for that antibiotic meaning antibiotic is taken .
We do not walk through shortcut .
Complete the course of those pills .
Even after leaving halfway those bacteria will be benefitted , even after taking more than necessary the bacteria will be benefitted so the course of taking pills has been determined in all the days .
It is important to fulfil it properly , but it is important to complete the course .
In medical terms it is called antibiotic registration , how to use antibiotic , its rules should be followed .
In the last decade the maternal mortality rate has decreased , but even today the lives of the pregnant mothers are not able to escape in large quantity .
Decrease in amount of blood during pregnancy , infection occurring during pregnancy , high blood pressure , nobody knows any kind of complications lead to their life .
Keeping in mind this thing the Government of India has started a new campaign whose name is the Prime Minister 's safe motherhood campaign ' .
Through this campaign the nine stars of every month will be tested freely at the government health center of the pregnant woman .
In order to give life to both mother and child I warned therapists that you can not provide free service to poor mothers at 9 points .
My doctor can not give brother-in-law to the poor for twelve days in a year
There are thousands of such doctors , they have written the work as well as later on by considering my statement .
Thousands of such doctors are such that who have considered me .
The whole world is worrying about my loved countrymen , weather change , global warming , environment today .
It is being discussed in a collective form in the country and in the world .
Shukracharya Niti has been said - Nasti kula Anaushdhan - There is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties .
Those who donate trees , they also preserve them in heaven like trees .
But even today there are some such people who follow these ideals , bring in conduct .
According to the admonition of the Mahabharata , the trees also cross the responsibility of the child in the world .
In Junnar Taluka of Pune of Maharashtra a farmer of Narayanpur village Khandhu Maratu Mahatra made the marriage of his son Sonal in a different inspirational way .
The temples start the tradition of planting in good rainy season .
Planting can easily become a mass movement .
I continuously tell the farmer ' s bond that we harm the land because of the dam falling on the edge of our farm , can we do the field of wood instead of the dam at that place
Today in order to make houses , to make wood goods in India several crores of rupees have to be brought from the country and abroad .
If we have planted a tree that is useful for the work of wood and house , then fifteen - twenty years later by the permission of the government it can also be discovered by cutting it , we can get a new source of production from this , and we can save India from making folk income .
In the past few days , in many states due to the use of climate , the Government of India has endorsed a CAMPA -LRB- CAMPA -RRB- lawlessness , it is going to the states for more than 40 thousand crore rupees .
I was told that on July 1 the Maharashtra government has planted two crore trees in the entire state and the next year it has been decided to plant three crore trees .
The government has raised a big mass movement .
Rajasthan , Maru - Bhumi have done a big forest festival and has made a plan to plant fifty lakh trees .
In Rajasthan five lakh trees are not a small thing .
Those who have the land of Rajasthan , they can know how big they have raised .
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase the greenery of 50 percent till 2029 .
The Green India Complex which has been started by the Central Government has also started this work by the Railways .
There is an excellent tradition of the famous Forest Festival in Gujarat .
This year in Gujarat many projects like Amravan , Ekta Van , Shahid Van have taken the elephants and have been running for the plantation of crores of trees .
I can not mention all the kingdoms but are eligible for all happiness .
My dear countrymen , I got a chance to go to South Africa a few days ago .
When foreign tourists are there then international dharna talks about trade , security related discussions take place , some concentration correspondence is happening .
But for me the journey of South Africa was like a kind of pilgrimage .
South Africa said that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela .
If the words of non - violence , love , efficiency fall on the ears then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela shadows appear before us .
During the journey of my south Africa the residence of Mahatma Gandhi had gone to Finics Satellment , is known as Sarvodaya .
His meeting will always be in my memory .
There is no such big mantra for any society and government , equal opportunity .
Both the ways of equality and supremacy take us to the future of the world .
We hope for all good life , want a good future of children , the needs of everyone are different , the forward time is different , but the road is the same and that is development , equality , equality , equality , equality , equality , mammabhava .
Whether we will respect these Indians or who have shown this original mantra of life in South Africa from our lives .
He told me about an hour . Pantpradhanji , I am speaking artificial warma from Bangalore .
I had read a record in the present utensil a few days ago , because of a woman bursting and losing e-mail one lakh rupees and committing suicide .
I was so sad about it as a woman.
I have to know your thoughts about this .
Everyone knows this thing , if we know the things that we love on our mobile , e-mail , then the messages that you have got so much interesting , you give so much money and take so much money .
Some people fall in love , some are bursting with lovingness .
Through these techniques the types of physiotherapy are spread all over the world .
We also sometimes fall in love .
I feel that we should be cautious of this love , should be cautious , if such a bad news comes , then we should tell them in our friends and family , they should make a little aware .
My beloved countrymen , the Satra of the Parliament is on now , I got a chance to meet many people during that contact with the Sattra .
Your specialists bring people from your department , meet , tell them about themselves , tell their problems .
But I had a pleasant experience these days .
Some students of Aligarh came to me .
The excitement of children and children was worth seeing , they brought a big album automatically .
Artificial paintings have been carved , painted at the station .
You must go to Aligarh and definitely see this station .
This is an example of changing people 's participation .
Blessedness to all those working in this way , special enjoyment of my partners of Aligarh .
My beloved countrymen , along with the rainy season there is also a season of census in our country .
Festivals are celebrated in fairs , temples , pilgrimages .
You are also joining these festivals at home and home .
Raksha Bandhan is a special importance of our ribs .
Like the last year this year also can not we give the parents of our country the ' Prime Minister 's Security Vima Yojana ' or ' Life Jyoti Vima Yojana ' to seek protection
Think , give such a gift to the wife , due to which her life will get very safe .
Not only this , if there is a woman making food in your house , there is a woman who cleanses her house , daughter of poor mother , we can give her a gift to ' Safe Vima Yojna ' or ' Life Jyoti Vima Yojana ' .
My dear countrymen , many of us are such people who were born after independence and I am the first prime minister of this country which has been born in independent Hindustan .
Hind Chodolla can give us new inspiration for 75 years and 70 years of India ' s independence , can create new enthusiasm , hope , this can be the opportunity for the composition of doing anything for the country .
The preservation of freedom is not a government program , it should be of the people of the country .
Like Diwali this must be its festival .
I express such hope , we will also do some good work connecting with the inspiration of the country .
My dear countrymen , on 15th August I get the privilege of condolences with the people of the country from Red Fort . This is a tradition .
You will also have some things in your mind , you will have such a desire , that thing should be engraved from the Red Fort .
Whatever thoughts are coming in your mind , we would like to tell me from the Red Fort as your chief servant , then you must write me , give some suggestions , advice to give new ideas .
I invite you , let us remind the virgins sacrificed for freedom , remind the great men who live for India and proceed to do something for the country .
Once again I have got the opportunity to talk about the mind .
My mind is that there is no activity .
I am interested in communicating with myself .
And I feel joyous that I can reach the corners of Hindustan , through the medium of my heart ' to the most common citizens of the country .
For the successful attempts made by the sky window to spread translation between the regional languages of the mind at eight o'clock in the night , I consider the auspices of the sky .
And I am happy of this thing that the citizens who listen to my mind ' s program , they bring their feelings to me through the medium of telephone and through the point of view of ' My Gove ' and through the medium of Narendra Modi Pass ' program .
I am useful in running the government in the suggested cases we sent .
How active should the government be for public welfare
How important should the works of public welfare be given
For this , my translation happening with us is very important in this regard .
5th June is the world environment day .
There are discussions on environment or subject worldwide , care is expressed .
At this time the main concept of environment day has been decided by the United States which is ero Tolerance for Alligal Wildlife Trade i . . the business of the wild animals will be discussed completely , but we should also speak about the tree , talk about water .
The reason for this is that we have seen that in the jungles near the Himalayan foothills of Uttarakhand , Himachal , Jammu and Kashmir , there was a sudden hypnotise .
Therefore protecting jungles , saving water becomes the duty of our allies , responsibility .
With the chief ministers of each state about two - five hours have been discussed .
Barkai listened to what to tell them .
Some states , especially Andhra Pradesh , Gujarat have used a lot of technology .
Through these successful solutions made by the state governments we have to reach other states of the country as well .
In order to die on such problems the part along with the people becomes the main cause of success , it proves to be the main source .
And therefore water supply is equally important .
And therefore dropmore crop - every drop - high production , micro irrigation - minute synthesis , pink produced on less water .
In many states cattle producing farmers are now using syringe , syringe , it is a matter of joy , some are using syringe .
I also came to know from them that there are big objectives in front of the other states , especially the three states of Maharashtra , Andhra and Gujarat have done a lot of work in the matter of synthesis .
Their effort is to bring two-two , three-three lakh hectares of Jamin micro synthesis every year .
If this pleasure is laid in all the states , then there will be great benefit in agriculture and not only the accumulation of water will also increase .
Through this project our brother-in-law Mission Bhagirathi of Telangan an attempt has been made to use the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers properly .
Through the medium of numerous progress machines in Andhra Pradesh , efforts are being made to reinforce ground water with the help of mechanisms .
The people who are standing in Maharashtra are giving economic help along with their hard work .
Watery Shivar Abhiyan ' really seems to me that this slope will be useful to protect Maharashtra from the future water streams .
Chhattisgarh state has taken the luxurious hand of the kingdom of the people .
The big campaign has been taken to revive the royal palaces and Gujarat where the ancient times are different .
Only in some parts of that state there is a clutches of water .
A big work is being done by making a checkham , small bundle there .
This is really a pleasant experience .
But there is plenty of water therefore we stay incomplete and on the end of monsoon there is no water therefore if you are troubled then how will it go
And water is not limited to the fields only .
This is the subject related to villages , poor , peasant , farmer , urban , rural , Mrs . Garrib .
That is why when the rainy season is coming then how much water we saved in the rainy season of Yand when we celebrate Diwali .
We will see , our joy will increase many times .
And this is not only the government but also the work of the common man .
My dear countrymen , we have to build modern India .
Our India is to be transparent .
Which can be reached from one end to the other end of India in a similar way .
We will have to change our old habits to do this .
Today I want to touch such a topic about which we help me then we can go to that direction successfully .
But now time has changed .
The whole world is going towards castle society i . . non-rocket system .
Through electronic technique we can get money and send money .
There is no fear of going to your pocket thief in it , there is no concern of keeping in mind .
So it will be registered automatically .
In the beginning of using this method one will feel some difficult only once after the habit of habit this arrangement will be easy .
This is possible because in the last few days the Prime Minister 's Reproductive Plan , in which the bank of almost all the families of the country has been opened .
On the other hand base number was also found and mobile has now come into the hands of almost every Indian in India .
That is why genitals , base-mobile-jam -LRB- J . . -RRB- .
We can go ahead towards the anti-rocket system , cashless society by putting their oil .
We must have seen that money card has been given along with eating fertilizer .
In the coming time it will prove useful for both card creed and debit .
And holes are also available in a small instrument which is drunk .
O.
It is called the Point of Cell , through this instrument you can give donations to others using base number , rupee card .
One of the methods that the Government of India has taken , how can it be paid through POS
The second venture we have taken in hand is the Bangkok on mobile .
It will be very easy to describe money through your mobile phone .
This is the step that the bank lifted up towards its grandfather in a way .
For this activities are being started in the office of Post as well .
If we learn to use this method in practice , if we habit it then there will be no need for direct movement , there will be no need to take in blood pressure .
Behaviour stays on its own and it can be transparent .
Unconscious behavior , behavior of two numbers would stop .
The result of the delayed money will also decrease .
Therefore I must tell the people of the country , we started this .
We saw that once this system started , we went ahead easily .
Does anyone think about it twenty years ago , so that so many mobiles are in our hands .
Gradually habit has happened now it is not possible to stay without it .
This is possible , unconscious system -LRB- Cacheless Society -RRB- will be gradually shaped .
But if it appears in less time then it will be better .
We want to encourage our players participating in Rio Olympics to increase their confidence .
The chief minister was in charge of the post .
But he was also the minister of the Government of India .
Whether they get nutritious food according to the requirement .
What are those who want to be administrators for their physical activity
I enjoyed seeing the possibility of making new responsibilities as chief minister , as well as being so aware of his work as a creed minister in a cooperative environment .
When the people of Sawashkoti are standing with us this belief seems to our players then it becomes a big power and repeats their confidence .
In the past I had discovered the subject of fifta egger Seventeen World Cup .
From all over the country I have come to know about it and at this time I can see that the atmosphere of football has started getting ready throughout the country .
Many people are making their own association with sympathy .
I have received a lot of information about this on Nandra Modi Pavar .
It is possible that many of them are not playing , but the interest of playing in the minds of thousands of youths in the country was a pleasant experience for me .
Being between Cricket and India we are comfortable , but I have seen so much faith in football
Every thing should not be counted as victory and defeat .
Together with the sports activity India has made its identity in the world .
We also did something to create an environment of enthusiasm for our colleagues related to the area of Krida .
For the last eight-ten days there is a new dimension .
I am not talking about selective necessity , I talk about those students who have tested after studying net for the year .
Now it has become clear that the time of the tenth - dawn has started coming together and our daughter is singing sympathy .
It is a matter of joy .
I want to go ahead with faith.
But I have come forward a new kind of question and I have never considered about it anyway .
Reading this, I felt a lot of shit.
He says , when I went home after gaining 89 . 33 percent mark then I felt that I would be fit all around , the rain of pleasure would take place , but at the same time I told at home that if there has been more than four times then 90 percent has come .
But it seems as if there is a stir in my mind .
I feel that this pain is not of your unit but it can be of millions of crore students like you .
Because the environment has become such that those who have achieved , they should find fault in it as compared to being happy .
This is the second form of negative nature .
I want to tell the neighboring people , parents obligedly , welcome your children who come with them for sustenance .
Otherwise one day will come that you will get 100 percent qualities and even then Kuni will say , it is true that you have got 100 percent qualities but if you have done nutritiously then it would have been better .
Therefore it is important for every thing to have a limitation .
The Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written the patriot of this meaning .
They say , their nearby people are not ready to swim their niceness .
He said that he has been doing something better , has been doing something better .
I told you so much that in such a situation you do not let yourself balance .
Everybody expresses more , listen .
Stop staying in your position and also try to do some better .
But if the solution is not considered on what has been received then the new architecture will never be able to stand .
And therefore I will tell us gracefully , song of the success that has been achieved .
Those who do not get good quality in the field they go ahead in the game , go ahead in the music field , go ahead in the field of art work , go ahead in business business .
God has given some comfort to everyone .
Bus you recognize your internal capacity , fill it , you will make progress in your life .
One time it was that Santur Vadod was an integral part of the folk music of the Kashmir Valley .
But Pandit Shivkumar who touched this pool and today he became an important poet in the world music field .
Sunai - In Indian music field there used to be limited vessels of Sunai or vessels .
During the times of kings and kings there was a place of Sunai near the entrance of Darbar .
But Ustad Bisimilla Khan took this pedestrian in his hand and kept Sunai Lane at this height of an excellent pedestrian in the world .
My beloved countrymen , sometimes I remember that the expenditure on medicines in our poor families in our country proves to be the economic vehicle of that family to slide .
And it is true that the cost of not falling sick is very less , but after becoming sick the health becomes like the first time only a lot of expenditure comes .
Why should we not choose our lifestyle such that we will not only have diseases , we will not have the economic burden on our families .
One , keeping clean is the most important way to stay away from this disease , base .
Who can do the biggest service of the poor , then it is cleanliness .
And the other thing is that for whom I keep constant in mind is yoga .
Sometimes it is also called yoga .
On 21st June this is the International Yoga Day .
There is an attraction of yoga all over the world , faith and the world has adopted it .
This unique gift given by our ancestors to us is what we have given to the world .
The stress-affected world gets a balanced life from yoga .
Staying healthy for the person connected with yoga students , being balanced , creation of temporary desire power in mind , concentration in every work or things are easily possible .
June 21 - Yoga day is not just a program .
And sometimes due to community environment change can occur in the life of the person .
I hope we will definitely do something about it on 21st June .
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes .
Can we use this day on 21st June for yoga in our life
Can you do yogasana in your social life
This is my destiny that we do not stay back .
It is extremely important for us to stay healthy in India .
Through my beloved countrymen , my heart ' I always connect with you .
Many days ago I had given us a mobile number on which we could hear the voice of the mind by giving a missed call .
But now it has been made even more easy .
Anyway, whenever you want to hear us in that language by giving a missed call on this number.
Namaste.
We decide to do many things during holidays .
The program is seen and during these holidays season is held in the form of ambay , take the pleasure of ambay , it feels as if a little leftist has come in the afternoon , then it will happen .
But this time due to strong heat this enjoyment has been enjoyed all around .
It is natural to have environment of care throughout the country .
And in it also when there is continuous evil time then water strips rupture .
Sometimes due to acute attack , sometimes due to narrowness of the road , due to obstruction in the water supply there is less water accumulation than capacity in the reservoir .
And due to this happening for years water consumption capacity decreases .
Even then I have seen that citizens also make very good efforts for this .
In many villages there is awareness about this and the true price of water is known only those who have faced the crisis of hydroelectricity .
And there is sensitivity towards saving water at such places , and there is also the ability to do something about it .
A few days back I was told that the Hivere Bazar village council of Ahmad Nagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers of that place have handled this subject very sensitively .
Such pickles which take more water , like that of cat , they decided not to rub such pigs .
It looks very easy to hear but it does not look so easy .
Have all made such a big compilation together
He took a step towards Tushar irrigation , Thibak irrigation , water supply , water supply and therefore to die due to the deficiency of water this village has remained on its own .
Well , I tell you about this small village of Hiverbazar , but there are many such villages , all such villagers , I comfort them about their best work .
He got the construction of nearly seventeen fields .
As a result ground water level increased , water level came up .
When the picnics needed water then they got water and told them at a very high point .
In the products received from agriculture twenty percent has increased .
If water is saved then apart from the increase in the level of water there is improvement in the quantity of water .
But many such programs are run from the citizens , which never come forward .
If the government has given some good idea then sometimes it gets fame but we see it around us , then it will be remembered how to die on the wrong day how people try to get rid of the problem through new methods .
Because of these many problems if some good thing is known then the feeling of all the problems getting removed is produced in the mind , this is human nature .
In the rainy season of Yunda , there would be 116 to 110 percent rainy season , this possibility was found everywhere and as if any peace message was received by everyone .
There is more time for rainy season but due to good rains it has come to the forefront of miracles .
Can we take any precaution to save water from the village from now on
The farmers need soil , it proves useful for the rice in the fields .
Then if we put a swing in the field of the village then it will be beneficial for the field along with it the capacity to accumulate water in the palate will increase .
Water will come in our streets .
Today there is a problem of water in ourselves , there is a state of bad time but the time of coming months is in our hands .
The worry that they want is social because this work has started since last thirty years .
Many governments came , many plans were found , so much money was spent .
Ganga gives us diversity . Ganga gives us employment , we get new power to live from the Ganges .
As the Ganges flows , the economic activities of the country give a new speed .
A bhagirath brought us to the Ganges but today there is a need of Kottayam Bhagirathi to save her .
This mood will never be successful without participating people .
Many attempts are being started in this regard at the government level .
For this efforts are being made to gain co - operation from the states of Ganga .
Trying to include social and voluntary organizations in it .
In order to keep the flow of the Ganges , to keep the surface of the Ganges clean and to stop industrial pollution in the Ganges water many steps have been taken .
In the utensils of the Ganges , everyday dense stream comes out in large quantity .
To clean this garbage the work of cleaning garbage on water at places like Varanasi , Allahabad , Kanpur , Patna is done with the help of trash skimer .
It has been said that all the local administration institutions have been provided and they should clean the garbage using it .
And as soon as I was told , where this effort is being done properly , three to one tons of garbage is taken out everyday .
That is , it is true that in such a large quantity the dirt coming out has stopped from increasing .
In the coming time plans have been made to settle trash skimers somewhere else , people living on the knees of the Ganges and the Yamuna will soon feel it .
In order to encourage industrial pollution , along with paper - logistics industry , drunken manufacturing factories and sugar factory arch has been prepared .
I still feel like it's a good result.
The forgetting of the fluids falling from the paper factory is now on the way to close .
We are walking towards the right direction , this is its symptom and in one way awareness has also increased .
And I have seen that if a person meets me not only on the banks of the Ganges , but in the southern part of the far away , then he definitely says , Saheb , Ganga will not be clean
This belief of the common people will gain success in the galaxy of cleanliness .
In the work of cleaning the Ganges the citizens are donating .
This work is going on in a good way .
My dear countrymen, 24 April today.
This day is celebrated as Panchayat Raj Day in India .
This star had started the Panchayat kingdom in our country .
And gradually the Panchayat royal system spread over the entire country is working successfully today as an important factor of our democratic governance machinery .
On 14th April , Jayantini of Dr . Ambedkar , I got the opportunity to go to the place where his birthplace is Mahu .
I got the opportunity to bow down to that holy land and today in 24th century in Jharkhand state , where most of our tribal brothers live , I am celebrating the Punchayat Raj Day in that state .
And at three o'clock in the afternoon all the Panchayat institutions of the country got condolences .
These campaigns have done a big job of creating awareness .
How would Lokshahi institution be successful at the village level in the corners of Hindustan .
How will the village be self-fulfilled
In some villages the provision of food grains has been taken .
The awakening that has come from the villages is the prince of India - Udaya .
The base of Indo-Udaya village Uday is this itself .
That is why if we fill the village Uday then the desired results will not remain unavailable .
From Mumbai Sharmila Gharpure phoned and expressed his heart ' s concern .
I am speaking from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpura .
My question is about school and college education .
There is a need for improvement in the education sector for many years .
Not getting proper schools or colleges or not getting the status of education .
Even after the completion of education of children they do not know many important things because of which their children stay behind in the world .
What are your thoughts about this
Today the biggest dream of the elders coming in every family is that is education of children .
The quantity of worrying about how to learn , to advise children , how to get good education should increase its quantity and I believe that in the families in which this awareness is felt , the result of which is seen falling on the school .
Every government in our country has filled the issue of education and every government has also made efforts for it in its own way .
But now more than the importance of extension it is to improve our education system .
We have done a great job of expansion .
Now we have to focus on quality education .
We need to be our principal now to learn from literacy mohim .
Now we have to pay attention to the cart counted on the consequences .
How many children came to school today princely states have been seen .
Now those children who have come to school , they will get good education , proper education and we will have to focus on this .
In the economy of this government also we have seen , efforts have been made to fill up giving good education .
Ten government universities and ten private universities have been told to come out of government control and we will be able to see in this economy .
Tell us to work to become the best university , best university .
This plan has been brought to them with the aim of giving complete freedom .
At the same time the importance of education is as much .
For the past few days the citizens have been considering me about one point .
Web portal he writes on My Govt , some write on my narrow pearls , and many youths are written in it .
Hon ' ble Pantamskar , I am speaking from Bijnor Mona Karnawal .
Along with education for the youths of today 's times there is also a lot of importance in the field of creed .
In them there is a need to be association , good leadership , due to which their all-round development will also happen .
My wish is to encourage maximum youth and the government also encourage NCC , NSS and India Scoutus and Guides .
One day I came in my mind, before speaking to you, talk to all these mandalis.
And when I thought to them that sometimes my such batch had happened before , their answer was on it , because of getting freedom from the country this is the first such batch today .
That is why in the context of these common works the younger groups , the young friends embraced me , I consider all those respects .
A lot of work is being done at your own level , but in a collective form , if we work together then how many adverse effects can be obtained .
And enthusiasm was seen in them as well , doing something . Now it is true that I am automatically a cadet of NCC or national square army .
I got the benefit of childhood and also I believe that such organizations should fill new consciousness .
Or I put some time in the battery before them .
Talking to them on many things .
Many youth organizations are working towards us , what can be renowned in their programs .
If we write this on my Narendra Modi Pass then I will reach that right place and I feel that after this sitting all these things will get a pace .
I feel this and join yourself with all this , it will come in your mind , it will happen .
My dear countrymen , we have to tell me one thing that we will wander to think all .
This is the thing that makes us all aware , it seems to me .
We must have seen that the state situation of our country is such that in the last several selectors how many times the gas cylinders would be discussed .
And every state bird had to feel that if you want to reach the middle class people with the intention of selecting then Gas syllabus is an important subject .
This is a public experience .
But after going out of this chowk it has never been considered .
Today , my countrymen , I am enjoying asking my glimpse before us .
I chose a different route , and that was the way to trust the mass welfare .
Sometimes we have to keep more faith in our people than to keep ourselves confident .
This is not a small thing , my loved countrymen .
Grants in our country are not a grant in such an equation .
I specially tell all the royal classes today , everywhere , whether we want to believe in the people or not .
We have never considered , we will get such a result .
Or we need to go.
And I always feel as if I have come in my mind that you have to be freed for the third and fourth class job .
Those who have received expertise , have been sent believe in them .
Sometimes I feel as if we declare it or that there is no ticket postponement on this one way of the train .
This comes in my mind , it can not be some government rules , but faithfully the environment can be prepared .
And this environment is not a state leader , one crore families of the country have prepared it .
Every braking necessity is painful on every present utensil and frequent vessel .
In this country of hundreds and hundreds of crores of population , is there nothing good happening near us
Please change the situation.
Raviji has expressed his acute regret , but I feel that this anger is on the situation of not being on me .
If we remember, our Maji President Dr. A.
Hallie I have seen that some television channels make positive weather special time .
In today 's time positive environment is getting ready .
Everybody feels like getting accurate , good healthy people .
It is true that the biggest person , the best thing , the best words , the best words , will be told in a better way , the more consequences it gets , the more results it gets positive .
It is true that if you pay more attention to goodness then there will not be enough space for bad things in yourself .
If the blindness of the blind is removed , it will happen .
And that is why we may be convinced that the Western Government named Transforming India has started .
Not only of the government but also of the citizens .
And this is an association portal on which we can send a good report of ourselves .
You can go to yoga .
Raviji has given you good information , but please do not come to me .
Kumbh Mela is the speciality of our country .
Kumbh Mela can become the center of attraction for tourism .
It used to be less people of the world for so long , many people come to the river bank .
In calm , calm and peaceful environment adventurous is celebrated .
From the point of view of this event , in view of program management , people are making new criteria established in view of participation .
Since last two days I have been watching , many have been uploading pictures of Kumbh Mela .
I feel that the tourism department of the Government of India should take competition of such photographs by the State Government and make people aware that take out the best photographs .
Not only should there be cleanliness but the people returning from there will take this message of cleanliness .
I feel as if the Kumbh festival is a religious , spiritual fair but we can change it in a social humor .
Normally like this I have associated with my mind with a unique relationship , it feels joy of me , many blessings again and again .
Often I and you also have a wait for the mother of the mind .
At this time I have seen , very long , reactive , phones have come , there are many things , information , inspiration , inspiration , everybody is doing something or the other , tell me - one feeling feels a feeling , and there is a lot of this in all that I have to include , but there is a limit of time , so everyone can not even be included .
However , in the clutches of your own mind there is a desire to punish you once again .
You must have remembered that in the last time we had discussed the book of some things of Premchandji and some of the books of which we used to synthesis everyone through the medium of Narendra Modi App .
Some people have advised me to speak about some more books .
But I should assume one thing that I can not give time to make a book on a very large scale .
But one advantage is that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of many books from what you write and send .
But this which is the experience of the last one month , from which I feel as if we want to take this program forward .
We make a corners of books on Narendra Modi App and when we read a new book , write , discuss there and you can also suggest a good name for the corners of these books .
And I am feeling that on the subject of water today the minds of Indians have been removed .
Many effective efforts are being started throughout the country for water conservation .
People have studied information about traditional methods .
Several charms have been started on the conservation of water through mediums .
If the government is , NGOs are doing something or the other on the battlefield .
The rural people have worked as a definite direction to a stream flowing from the mountain .
And that too pure indigenous method.
Due to this not only the loss of soil smoke and pucca is stopped , but also the fields have started getting water .
It will be enjoyed to know all of us , that the beautiful states of the northeast are the first states of the country to prepare water streams .
I enjoy the government there .
In Haryana , those picnics who have less water , the fields of such pigs are being run and there is no harm to the farmer .
Many fairs are held with the permission of the saints .
Do not use these fairs for water conservation
In the fairs people go to every layer of society .
In these fairs we can give a very effective way of saving water , can fill performances , dramatic drama , along with festivals we can reach the message of water conservation in a very easy way .
In reality , in Moscow or month World Children Winners Crida competition was organised .
This is an incomplete creed surgery in which young people who survived from cancer i . . those people who have come out fighting cancer in their lives participate .
In this competition , competitions like Nambaji , Buddhism , Waterfall , Running , football and table tennis have been organised .
All these ten winners of our country jinked medal in this competition .
Some of these players have won more than one medal .
Sanjeevi Haripura of Jodhpur in Rajasthan , Mahendrakumar Danda of Kolkata , P of Teluguna .
Many such Aravind Rao , many people from different parts of the country have written me on the Narendra Modi Ape and Maa Gava and have warned me of churning on Chandrayan-2 in the mind .
In reality , the point of view of international progress in the year 2001 has remained very popular for India .
Our scientists had left A Sat in March and after that Chandrayan-2 .
But in the humility of select there could not be much discussion on big and important hugs like A Sat .
We gained the ability to lodge a height of 300 kilometres in just three minutes with the help of A Sat Temperature .
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve innumerable success and now on 22 July the entire country , Chandrayan - 2 in the interval of Sriharikota , how its footsteps would be achieved .
The photographs of Chandrayan-2 fill the countrymen with glory and happiness .
Chandranyaan-2 , this Mohim is special in many ways .
Chandrayan - 2 will make clear our understanding more about Chandra .
By this we can get more comprehensive information about the moon , but if you think , what two big things do I get from Chandrayan-2 , then I will say , these two things are , Feath and Firalesnace meaning faith and fearlessness .
We should believe in our immunity and capacity , we should trust our immunity and capacity .
We will be enjoyed listening to Chandrayan-2 , which is completely Indian form .
He is Indian in both heart and habits .
The whole of the indigenous method is synonymous .
When there was a description of something new in the new areas , immense enthusiasm , then our scientists are the best , of the world class , this is a proven fame once again .
Another important factor is that there is no need to panic in any crisis .
The methods of which our scientists , in adventurous time , by making a day of night , leave all the tantrik questions in Chandrayan - 2 stages , this work is incomplete .
Scientists have seen this great penance worldwide .
It should seem respectful to all of us and even after coming to the difficulty the time of reaching the moonlight does not change , this also many people feel very surprised .
We have to face many temporary setback problems in our life , but we used to be able to die on it , remember it always .
Chandranyaan . will inspire the youths of Mohim country to introduce science and renowned amendment , I have full faith in it .
In the end science is the only way of development .
Now we are waiting for more than the month of September , when lander - Vikram and rover - knowledge will come down on the surface of the moon .
Today through the mother of mind , I invite students of the country , youth partners , giving information about an extremely entertaining competition to the youth and youth of the country - a poet Community
I am young friends , students , they participate in this poetry competitiveness and make their participation more entertaining and unforgettable , unsuccessful .
I prefer school , public , enthusiastic chief teacher and teachers to take a lot of meditation to win their rule .
The most thrilling thing is that the students receiving maximum qualities from each state will take their expenses to Shriharikot and in September when they get to the surface of the moonlight , then they will get a chance to be witness to the moment .
Or it would be a historical event for victorious students , but for that you will have to participate in the poetry competitiveness , you will have to achieve maximum qualities , you will have to become victorious .
My dear countrymen, you'll be a watch.
The relations of our mind have been speeding up the cleanliness campaign from time to time and the efforts being made for cleaning these methods have always been inspired by the mind .
The journey started five years ago is presenting new standards of cleanliness from many parts today .
We have achieved ideal situation in the context of cleanliness , not just roots , but the way the success that we have achieved in the context of cleanliness from hostile villages to public places is the power of the complication of one hundred and thirteen crore countrymen , but we will not stop coming here .
This campaign has now started moving ahead towards beauty from cleanliness .
Now a few days back I was watching the story of Yogesh Saini and his team in Midia .
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and Americans have returned to India to serve Bharat Mata leaving their job .
Some time back he raised the issue of making Delhi clean not only beautiful but also beautiful .
He started with garbage in Lodhi Garden in his Times .
Through Street Art , many parts of Delhi , beautiful paintings are decorated .
When he started showing his art from the walls of Overbridge and shawls to the hut , people also got the status and in a way this silsi started .
You will remember that in the times of Kumbh the paintings of the road to Prayagraj used to be decorated .
I realized , Yogesh Saini and his teams also had a very big role in it .
Even if there is no sound of colors and rashes , but the indradhans which are produced by the paintings made of them prove to be more effective than thousand words and we also experience it in the beauty of the cleanliness campaign .
The culture of making wealth from waste should develop in our society , it is very important for us .
If we talk to one another , then we are moving ahead towards making gold from the garbage .
My beloved countrymen , a few days ago , I read a very entertaining reaction on ' May Gave ' .
The Shaupiya of Jammu and Kashmir was the reaction of Bhai Mahammad Aslam staying here .
He wrote , It feels good to hear the ' MN Ki Baat ' program .
I am happy to say this , I played a successful role in organizing the Community Mobilization Programme in Jammu and Kashmir .
Along with this arrangement of online care of the program should also be there .
I believe it was the first such program in which the people made direct communication with the government .
Bhai Mahammad Aslamji sent me this message and on reading it my desire to know about the Bangkok to Village program increased and when I got a comprehensive information about it then the whole country should know it , I would like it .
The imagination of how exciting the people of Kashmir are to join the main flow of development , how excited they are , comes through this program .
The question of literacy , sex quality , health , cleanness , water conservation , weight , water , mulech education , excellent citizens has been discussed on many such subjects .
Friends , this program was not merely governmental comparison , the authority returned to the village throughout the day , but this time the elders also made a camp in two days and one in Panchayat , in which they got the opportunity to stay in the village .
Khello should have kept the creed of the children under India .
Literature , job card of MNREGA goes well and the certificate of the community also came out there .
This festival of popular development of Kashmir has joined openly .
The interesting thing is that the organization of ' Bang Tu Village ' program was done in such remote areas , to reach where the government officials had to climb the mountains by climbing the mountains and sometimes one and a half days .
This authority also went to such border Panchayatis where there is constant fear of tablet from the border , not only this , the officials also went uninterruptedly in the sensitive areas of Shopia , Pulwama , Kulgam and Anantnag districts .
Some princes got so much welcomed in the village that they stayed in the village for more than two days .
In these areas there are rural areas , in which a large number of people take part and plan plan plans for themselves , this saranch is very pleasant .
It is also clear that people are watching making penance on the path of development , watching usually walking , they can never be successful in their clutches .
My beloved countrymen , Gyanpeeth Purskaran , honored Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra has presented the month of the month of Shravan in one of his poems .
In this poem he has said , Hodige Madige Agaryd Langna . Adarag land is magnificent . In reality the boundaries of rain and water streams are cloudy and on seeing their beauty the earth is merged .
In the whole of India , although culture and linguistic people celebrate Shravan month in their own ways .
When we look around in this monastery then it seems as if we have wear the shawl of greenery on earth .
Everywhere there is a new energy communication .
In this sacred month many devotees go to Kavad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra , while some fast regularly and wait for emotions like Janmashtami and Nagpanchami .
During this time , the symptoms of the love of the grandson also come .
If the discussion of the month of Shravan starts , then we will be happy to hear that at this time the most emotional part has been included in the Amarnath Yatra for the past four years .
Since July till now more than three lakh pilgrims have seen the holy Amarnath cave .
The more emotional partners had participated in this journey running for 60 days in 215 , more emotional this time has joined only 28 days .
I particularly admire the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their intent towards the success of Amarnath Yatra .
Those people who return from the journey , they lose the feelings of love and love of the people of the state .
All these things have proved to be very beneficial for tourism in future .
Even in Uttarakhand , since this year the journey of Chardham has started , since then in one and a half months more than 8 lakh devotees have seen Kedarnath Dham itself , yet I have been told .
After the physical dangers occurring in 2001 , first , so many pilgrimages have reached there .
I am aware of all ourselves , in the areas where you would see natural beauty during monsoon , you must go to such areas .
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country tourism and pilgrimage are not less than this .
This beautiful and enjoyable month of Shravan should be accompanied by new energy , new hope and new glory in all of us , so I wish for all of us .
Similarly , in the month of August India comes with the memory of snatching movement .
We should make some special preparations for August 15 , this is my wish . Recognize the new method to celebrate this festival independently .
When we see the TV then we see only one flame of rains , on all sides , pur , sandals water , flowing Kondi , other pictures of Mansoon , our fascinating birds , tearing birds , flowing waterfalls , green slopes , we will have to come out with our families .
Rain , freshness and joyful freshness and happiness both bring together .
My beloved countrymen , the mother-in-law of the heart started , where to stop , it seems to be very difficult , but there is a limit of time .
I give everyone a lot of beauty of Easter .
My young friends, we're busy in the test.
Today we are often resisting the confrontation between India and Australia .
India has fought against Pakistan and Bangladesh .
It is time to get new revolutions in this game .
And we see that nutritious environment is also being prepared in India like football , hockey , tennis , cubbery .
Perhaps you may have come to know that in the next year under the 17 years of 2002 AFFFA i . . FIFA i . . the status of World Football competition is towards India .
24 unions of the world are coming to play in India .
On the other hand I see that the attraction of football in the youth class is increasing . EPAL , Spanish Ling , or Indian Superlig .
To know about these challenges , they take time for young friends to see them on a phone call .
How will the competition for joining the game in government , educational institutions and social organizations stand
We see all this happening in the case of cricket .
But this environment has to be prepared for other games as well .
This is a golden boundary to identify India .
We have decided about tourism , my beloved students , about going to visit these holidays .
And I remember that the work which we did not accumulate to our tourism department , our cultural department was not possible , which the state governments could not do and the Indian government could not even do it .
India is filled with variety .
Perhaps there is no such district in Hindustan where I have not gone .
I enjoy special pleasures of Coal India .
And nearly ten thousand citizens have visited the Kolasa Khan of Sawane near Nagpur as a tourist .
Some efforts are being seen both from tourists and tourists living in tourist places .
All attempts are not just a scientific method but only happening .
Do we also take special care of this newly
My young friend will definitely help me in this work .
Complete employment is possible through tourism area .
India is far behind in comparison to the world in tourism .
But if we decide to emphasize the tourism sector in the year 2001 then we can attract the world towards India .
By attracting big violence in the tourism sector of the world towards our country , millions of youths of our country can give them employment opportunities .
Whether government , institution , society or citizen , we have to do this work together .
Let us try to do this .
My young friends , sweets came and I do not seem right .
If you can not swim then you will decide to learn to swim in these strips .
If the cycle is not able to run then if the cycle is not able to run in these cycles then the cycle is taught in these cycles .
Even today while typing on computer I do with two fingers , should not I not learn to do clean typing
There are many factors for our personality development .
So much that you will see that after the start of school after the holiday , on the start of the college you will go back there and tell your friend that in this holiday I learned this . If you do not learn anything then you will say .
My time has come. You just learned new.
There will be mutual discussion on this among friends .
During this time many informations have been received on the microbes of the mind .
My name is Abi Chaturvedi . Namskar , Pantpread Nrandra Modiji .
In the last holiday of summer we had told that the symptoms also have the problem of sunlight , therefore keep your balcony or glass filling water in a utensil for symptoms .
I did the same way and I am happy to say that this was my friend with the sympathy .
He telephoned me and reminded me of a changal work .
During the past I had remembered and I had told that in summers keep the birds filled with water in the utensils of your dragon .
He told me that he does this throughout the year and with many signs his friendship has happened .
He loved great poet Mahadevi Varma of the Hindi literature region .
They had written in their poems, I won't let you go, I'll fill the eggs from the donors and fill the hods, salt and sweet salt.
This goddess told us that we also did this thing .
I rejoice in the matter of giving attention to a very important issue and also consider respect .
Have we ever given them water during summers
Sculpture , I consider myself very respectful , you have engraved a sensitive subject in a very easy way .
However , this habit is only in India .
But I consider it my beloved about seeing this thing from Barkai .
We have heard a lot of my favorite fielder brothers and sisters , digital India - digital India .
Some people feel that digital India is the world of youths in the city only .
But it is not so .
You will feel happy to hear what a facility has been prepared for your service .
If you have downloaded what facilities in your mobile phone then through it a lot of information about agriculture , weather will be taken very easily .
I am hopeful of what kind of convenience my brethren will download on their mobile .
My farmer brother-in-law , others , summers i . . holidays . but summers for the farmers i . . sweating time .
Then resists the rain .
The time before the start of every season of agriculture is very important for the farmers .
But we should also think of the countrymen , what will happen to ourselves by drinking water .
The way of water coming in the pond , water flowing pond , where some garbage is accumulated or some accuracy has occurred , water coming stops and as a result the water supply slowly decreases .
First of all saved water , filled the lake , filled the river drains , then even if the rain does not fall then its less harm will occur .
This time we have seen , we have decided to make five lakh fields .
It has been emphasized to create water resources for the accumulation of water through manrago .
There are many such villages in the country , there are many progressive fields , many aware citizens who have done this work .
But still it is necessary to do more work today .
My farmer brother Bhaginino , one thing I will tell you again today . Government of India had organised a farming magnificent performance as soon as possible .
In it I saw how modern techniques have been fielded .
But till every field it is still left to reach .
In order to reduce the use of potatoes , it has also started becoming a farmer .
Want to conduct this mantra , use the scientific method , we need to look forward to our agricultural area .
I hope that the necessary tasks for the accumulation of water to save water will be fulfilled by determination in one or two months of our hand .
My beloved countrymen , April 7 is the world health day .
Vijay on diabetes is a declaration of World Health Day .
It is said that in the middle of 214 the institution of diabetes patients was six and a half crore .
Among the reasons behind death the cause of death of 3 percent was found to be diabetes .
The whole world is worried because of diabetes therefore on 7th April , the concept of victory over world health benefit diabetes has been decided .
We all know that our lifestyle type 2 is the main cause of diabetes .
If you want yogasanas then do yogasana .
Otherwise do exercise at least walking , running .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy .
Sometimes we feel comfortable to test health .
And on getting a lot of disorder in diabetes it is believed that diabetes has already disintegrated in our body .
This means that this is such a disease which can be tested quickly .
My dear countrymen , there is a lot of work towards us about this .
I must tell you that you have tuberculosis or diabetes , that we have done its complete upgradation .
And therefore in order to overcome diabetes to get rid of tuberculosis I advise all the countrymen .
Especially on 14th April, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti.
His one-sided Jayanti was celebrated throughout the country .
One Panchatith - Mahu is his birthplace here .
Landon - wherever he took higher education , Nagpur - where he took blessings .
I am getting the privilege of going to Mahu at the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar .
Babasaheb has given us a lot to become an excellent citizen .
By conducting the path they showed , becoming an excellent citizen we can offer them a lot of faith .
In the last few days , Vikram Sansar will start , new Vikram Sansar will come .
In different states they are celebrated in different ways .
You can hear on your mobile phone .
We just have to give a fixed time .
We make a missed call according to your facilities .
If we have to listen to the earlier program of mind then we can hear it in our language .
Or I'll enjoy living with you.
My dear countrymen , we all have many beauty .
Because of this worldwide , how can the youth of India be able to increase their interest in playing
Or we also participate in this .
They sent photographs of such places , photos uploaded that they really enjoy seeing them .
Hobby-e-driver , if you have the desire to see something then you can first build the vision of seeing it .
Wherever the arrow has not gone before , there should be their desire to reach there .
Western Coal Filds Limited , Sawaneer place near Nagpur , are the minerals here .
When people go to tourist places then they buy something or the other , spend .
If you are poor , even if you want something , you will spend more .
I demand a problem before me to think .
Do we compose some new art , some council in these beauty to achieve something new in our personality
Why should not your child increase
Do you like to paint but do not come
Hey, let's start, it'll come.
In order to develop personality , to learn new arts , definitely use holidays to increase cycle .
There are countless areas .
The architecture of Mysore , Kuke has put a sensitive issue in front of itself .
If any of your questions ask them then they answer it , tell us by understanding it .
And once you use it then see what is your usefulness in it .
And even then if you want some answer then we make it a complaint to me .
Rescue water in villages or villages .
How can you save drops of water in the rainy season
How to stay in the village of water
I welcome this idea .
Because of excessive use of minerals we have become the victim of our geography .
But if you use excellent spices , then will you like to eat food
That only food will not be interested .
But today we have become inefficient in the matter of tuberculosis .
My beloved countrymen , Namskar , we are listening to my heart from the radio .
Now the thoughts of tests will start in your mind .
Or I want to join you in your journey as well .
I feel as much as you feel about the tests of your children .
But if we change our point of view of watching the test then we can become anxious .
I told you in the background of my heart program that your experience , your information should be sent to me on Narendra Modi Pavar .
Teachers , students who have achieved excellent success in life , the experts of the society sent many things to me by writing it .
Today I have to speak to parents , students and teachers especially from my mind ' s programme .
What I have heard , what I have read , what I have been told , I will tell you something in it , what I feel as if I am also telling myself .
But those students who are going to meet the test , I believe that this 25-30-minute translation will prove to be useful .
My beloved students , friends , what will be useful to them while roaming the peaks of success in life , before I speak something to you , if the beginning of the mother of today ' s mind is done by a famous operator in the world
Their experience will definitely prove to be useful to you .
I know that tests are going on in just a few days .
Some of us are under stress .
I have only one message .
You will keep your elders more than you , keep your teachers , keep your family members , keep your friends also .
Wherever you go , how will your preparation start in all the thoughts
How many qualities will you get
When I was playing cricket then I had a lot of ration from me .
Many difficult moments came in 24 years of Gelia and many good moments also came .
But it was always more than the people and as it grew , as the time progressed , it grew even more .
And for that I need to find a solution .
Then I thought that I kept myself above me and decided the goal of myself .
My attention was concentrated on the penis and then all the goals have become successful from us .
Seeing what was My friends , Tandulkarji saying
Do not burst under the womb of expectations .
You have to do your future .
Do you spend your time in comparison to others
You will see that no one will stop you from going forward , and you will get more success than the success achieved before this , then you will not need to stay dependent on another well to enjoy the solution .
You will feel self-confidence .
Do not consider friends , experts , games of figures .
Where did we get , how much we got
Or don't shut up.
It is known through these tests , what is your activity correct , it is understood from these tests .
And therefore if your dreams are huge , then the festival of joy will be on its own test .
And this is why what will happen this year
Do not keep yourself limited at all .
Keeping a great goal in front of the eye lashes , and even if there is less success in it then you will not feel disappointed , you will get inspiration to make more effort with more strength .
Thousands of citizens have sent small lawsuits from my pocket , their mobile .
Although the whole year , 365 days , your daily routine , your dreams and complications should be suitable .
Mr . Prabhakar Reddi told me a problem , sleeped at the time and he writes on the auditorium of reading early in the morning .
With the entrance and other essential things it is called Reddie to reach the examination center in time .
I do not have to say this , because I am not serious in sleeping .
And I do not sleep properly this is the complaint of my elder friends .
During examination , I talk about sleeping for you to test in stress free state .
Do you not do this
I have food , do not do it .
Staying sick in life is an important reason for the fact that the legs of success are deceived .
Not only this , daily routine also worsens by this .
And therefore do not understand anything small , hard .
Decided, look at it.
Those who are under these tensions negative effect of tension falls on their necks .
And on the basis of the exercise I have done , I leave any question paper in such confidence that whatever question paper comes , he leaves it in definite manner .
Or can we know the way to achieve success by cutting out the test .
Namskar me Vishwanathan Anand.
Let me start with you wishing for testing .
I am going to know how to test myself and my experience of that is now telling me .
Research , yes , after your presence these problems are similar to you , this has been known to me .
You should take proper rest , take a calm sleep at night , you should eat all the stomach , you must not relieved and the most important thing is that you should stay calm .
All this is like the left of the intelligence .
When you are playing , then you do not know , in the same way you do not even know what question is coming in the test .
Therefore if you stay calm and you have eaten all over your stomach , you will know that your brain will remember the right answer at the right time .
That's calm.
Do not give more stress on yourself , do not keep more than that .
This is important , look at this as an adventure . What do I need what I have taught in the year , can I leave this question
Repeat the most important thing at the last moment , remember what you do not remember , while giving test you may remember some cases along with the teachers or the students and this will help you in remembering a lot of things about that .
If you ignore the problems of difficulty then you will come to know that it is a new question for you and then when you test it you will be able to leave it better .
So stay calm . Take a good sleep at night , do not show high confidence but do not stay disappointed at the same time .
I have always seen that this test is better than you were afraid .
And while playing international intelligence you have also seen them , how they sit quietly .
It is true that it is difficult to say so , but efforts should be made .
If you do not talk to friends , go alone , stay like a comazon gull , keep on washing the book for the last moment then your mind will not stay calm again .
If water is calm then things of openness are also visible but if the surface of water is dissolved then nothing below is visible .
At that time one feels the internal tension .
Then I feel that if you rest a little then you will feel alright .
For this I have developed a mechanism automatically .
I breathe long , breathe deeply , breathe three times , five times deeply .
It takes 30 seconds , 40 seconds or 50 seconds for all this , but after this my mind becomes calm and mind is prepared to understand the subject .
This my experience may also be useful to you .
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing .
Whatever my power writes , even if at least half a day we want to spend time with our friends , family members .
And what do you do
Friends, don't do that.
If you have ever gone somewhere along with your parents then you should give that moment out of studies , tests for at least half an hour .
Rajatji said that it is like this to understand the problem .
My friend, what will I tell you about this " peace"
Before being tested today , such a person has sent a message to you that he is a teacher in the origin and has become a teacher of music today .
Together with this great scripture of Ramcharit Manas he is trying to reach the bottom of these scriptures throughout the country and around the world .
That worshipped Murari Bapu has described the students as a clue .
My friend, I want to tell you another thing today.
G.
Only one thing is certain that in the journey of developing the north end of life Yoga is as if Gurukilli .
You pay attention to it .
I have complete faith in it only .
My young friends , you have to go to the examination center .
Otherwise there is tension in mind .
If you understand that information then the time of regulating will not come to you .
I have also seen that the form of question paper has changed , this question paper is found on falling in hand .
Rav has inspired this issue of patience in their message .
The beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rao Saheb in words , we have heard that - I am from Bangalore .
R.
Rav speaks.
Because of tests also there is restlessness in them because of competitive tests .
Do not take care .
Give your best, this is what I tell all my young friends.
But at the same time it should also be kept in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country .
Decid what you have to do in life and do not leave it , you will be successful .
You are the lakes of this world , do not forget this , like trees and mountains you also have the right to stay here .
You need that of leadership , dedication and chicken pox .
Because of these properties you will be successful in all tests and other attempts .
For what you have to do I wish you .
Many blessings.
In the past , how is the method of a scientific scientific to tell the case .
What I take half an hour to say , that is what they say in three minutes .
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific mind .
I am very proud of the Rav Sahebs about giving inspiration to the children of the country .
He spoke about dedicative, determination, deligency or.
Friends standing quietly.
If you stand firmly then you will also feel scared of fear .
And the golden future will resist you to be successful with your hand .
Ruchika Dabbs has sent messages on my side .
And it is true , sensitivity has also said , positive point of view , creates positive condition of mind , positive energy .
Such a lot of things that inspire us sometimes occur , do not think that inspiration is received only by the students .
At any moment of life , on any movement of life , good generosity , truth incident gives us too much inspiration , gives great potential and at the time of crisis a new way can be achieved on the bottom of this motivation .
We read the information about Thomas Alva Adison , the father of the Divine of Vege .
But friends , sometimes it was considered how many years he had spent for this research . Many times he had to swallow up , time went , spent too much money .
He did not take any special education of this subject of mathematics , but in various fields like mathematical classification , anksiddhanta , Ramanujan put a pearl .
K.
Raling had told itself , this strength was important for them .
In today 's time test is not just students but also of all family , school , teachers .
Vijay Jindal has demanded that the parents of their desires do not stick to the children .
And seeing this we just go away , not just that , but we like to get the hand from that corner .
We also feel that we will progress faster than science .
This is the reason why I tell you today is the national science day .
For this research he proved to be the standard of Nobel prize .
And in its memory on 28 February this day as national science day we celebrate all over the country .
Curiosity is the birthplace of science .
In every heart one has to pay attention to scientific thoughts , every one has to wait for attraction of science , every step has to pay attention to new research .
Apart from the involvement of science and technology new research is not possible .
Today a new amendment should be achieved throughout the country of national science day .
I'm Sir C.
My friends , sometimes it takes a lot of time to get success and when success comes then our point of view to the world also changes .
We have heard that in the past few days science has been found to be a big and important research in the world .
Scientists from all over the world have studied many studies , they have wear something or the other .
In the past century the comprehensive science of Instein got finished due to this research , not only this , it has proved a great research in the field of physiotherapy .
It is a matter of fact that the common human society will be beneficial for the whole world .
In this simple research process we have special respect and joy in the form of Indian knowledge of the expert scientists of our country as well .
In the coming time our scientists will try to further this new research .
India will be a part of the efforts being made internationally .
And only after the loss of my countrymen an important decision has been taken in this regard .
The government has decided to establish Laser Interfamiter Gravitational Wave Observatory i . . LIGO in India to surround the next layer of this research .
There are two such centers in the world , third will stay in India .
Because of India 's participation this process will get new energy , new dimension .
On the basis of limited resources India is becoming active in this great scientific research of human welfare .
If I tell you one number of my beloved countrymen , then stop it .
By giving a missed call on this number you can hear the voice of your mind from the beginning .
You can also hear in your mother tongue .
The number to give missed call is 8190881908 I tell you again.
Friends are starting your examination , I also have the advice of the above mentioned test .
The people of hundreds of crores of people are taking care of me .
Just , let me test that the parawa will start you .
And when we are all successful then the country will be successful .
Then, Mitraho, we've got a lot of glasses.
Successlessly being free from its stress , going forward with a free mind , staying quiet .
In the last conspiracies of mind I told two things .
At the moment we celebrated Christmas and now we have started preparing for the new year 's reception .
India is divided into diversity .
There is a lot of sandalwood of festivals .
Sometimes it feels that India is such a country where the economy is based on the values .
What is the greater joy than the world being free from crisis , hostility , global temperature increase , natural crisis , or human created , all humanitarian happiness and calmness
We know that I use a lot of technique from which I get a lot of information about various subjects .
"MyGov." This portal I always see.
People go to different places to celebrate the holidays of Christmas .
Tourists will get all facilities in the tourism area . special attention is given to them only Saveshwarkar says that where there are tourist places , religious places , there are special attention should be paid to cleanliness .
And as we say , the guest goddess Bhav , we are coming to our house , at that time we clean the house , decorate the house .
Therefore we have to pay special attention to keeping cleanliness in our tourist places , religious places .
In the Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh in Bhojpura village , Deep Singh Malviya lives the best worker for a year .
I felt that he came to my rescue and that he would reach you .
Alip Singh Malviya living in Chotayasya village decided that if the goods used to build toilets in the village are provided then they will not take the permission of construction , they will make the construction of the toilet free .
Considering the construction of toilets this is a sacred work , in Bhojpura village , Dilip Singh built a hundred toilets .
I enjoy Alipsingh Malviya in the end .
This country is progressing fast only because of uninterrupted hard work of many people .
When every Indian knows that all Yoga has attracted this thing , and the common world celebrated the International Yoga Day and when all the world was connected then it is believed in our mind that this is our Hindu place .
When we get to see a unique form then this belief , this feeling is created in the supreme mind .
The subject of cleanliness is now discussed in a way at home .
Increasing participation of citizens among them .
The biggest advantage of this is that the government employees who do this work to reach village village will get solutions , they are taking the work of changing the lives of a village through the medium of their diplomacy , they will get enjoyment , whether poor or poor , whether women or youth or girls .
If the government does not do any work and which government does not do any work then it is their right to get that thing and they should not be able to reach it .
Right things , good things , useful things of common man are reaching them and for reaching them we need to try by the groups .
Doing this is one way of service .
I have made this a small attempt on me .
I can not do all this alone , but when I tell you then I should not do anything .
We have to reach hundreds of crores of people .
How will I reach without your help
We can reach them in the language of ordinary humans and they will get the things of their handicappedness so that they inspire them .
My young friends , in the address made from the Red Fort on 15 August , I had made a primary discussion about the Start Up India Stand up India or Sankalp .
After that in every eating of the government , that work started in every department .
Can India become the world capital in Start Up
In the new way, with the new amendment, Start Up will make a better opportunity for young men between our kingdoms, the production sector, the service sector, the field.
In every case there is a need for new ideas , new experiments , new efforts , other than this the world does not go forward .
Start up India , Stand up India Scheme is a big opportunity for our youth .
My young friends , on 16th January the whole act of the State Up India Stand up India program is being presented by the Government of India .
But it is not at all that we have to change it according to the needs of India .
Some poor person does foolishness , embraces , the work of this person becomes light , if the pain is less then it is expected to put some such research with our young friend .
I also inspire the state governments to take a step in this matter .
On 16th January I spoke more to myself on this subject .
I always welcome your information .
Beloved young friends , 12 January , Swami Vivekananda 's joy is there .
Like me people of this country have taken inspiration from Swami Vivekananda .
His Jayanti is celebrated as the National Youth Festival since 12 January 1995 .
This year this program will be held in Raipur in Chhattisgarh .
I know that the concept of the youth is Indian Youth of Development , Skill and Hormone .
In their school Axebal India Day , Sulabhscharya celebrated India Day . He expressed his feelings on the phone .
When the yoga of meeting such people working in society comes then many thoughts come in mind .
Now it is true that every word has its own different importance .
This year the Government of India started a smooth India campaign , I would go to that program but in some districts especially in Tamil Nadu I went there because of the Mahapur coming to Chennai so that the program of a comfortable India campaign could not be present .
But for going to that program there was a thought in my mind .
For the first time I felt that instead of disabled or disabled in our country I should use Divyaang ' .
These are those people with whom there are only or more such parts in which there is divineness , there is a secretion of divine power which is not with our sympathy .
I liked this word a lot.
In my country the citizens will now propagate the word Divyang instead of disabled .
I hope we look forward to this idea.
We have started that day of the comfortable India campaign .
Removing that smooth improvement , obvious and unprecedented , inspiring , make this impossible complex appear for the people .
In schools , hospitals , government offices , bus depots , railway stations there are rumps , accessible parking , accessibility , braillelippy , many things .
They have liked this .
We also participate in our way .
My beloved countrymen , government plans keep on coming continuously , but this plan is not just artificial motive , but it has to be taken care of .
Till the end of the factor it is necessary to reach it properly .
Their breathing should not be excreted in the files .
Because these plans are drawn , the Government of India has made an attempt a few days before bringing benefit of the project to the common man , poor man and the needy person .
In our country the gas of kitchen is granted to the cylinder .
This blood is of crore rupees , but it does not reach the beneficiaries in the right time , it does not have the desire to eat it .
The government changed a little in it .
With the help of fertilizer bank eating , base card the world 's largest direct benificent transformer scheme has been implemented and the bank of the poor beneficiaries of the grant has started depositing .
In the form of the world 's largest and successful direct profit transfer scheme this program has got place in the Guinness Book of World Record .
This plan is known by the name of Pahal .
By the end of November approximately 15 crore LPG holders have been proved beneficial for the plan .
This grant has started accumulating straight in eating 15 crore people 's bank .
There is no need for any curse , there is no possibility of misconception .
On the other hand , opening the base card , on the other hand the state government and central government together , making a list of beneficiaries , connecting them with base number and eating number .
A few days back , MNREGA , through which employment opportunities are available in the village .
There were many problems about it .
About 35 to 40 plans are now being included under direct benificent transformation .
My dear countrymen , on 26 January this is a golden moment .
The centuries of Jayanti of Babasaheb Ambedkar is the year of Rupyamhot .
In the Parliament i . . a special discussion was kept on the contract for two days and that happened in a very good way .
All the birds have spoken very well about the ability of knee , the importance of knee , the original voice of knee , and we have to continue this program .
Can the work of connecting the people with Satta and Satta with the people be done by the permission of the day of the day
The hour has given us a lot of rights , there has always been discussion about it and it should happen .
The time of election becomes aware all around , the thickness written on the walls appears to be very big , it is its sacred duty to pay attention .
What does not happen in the daily life of our duty at the time of death
While celebrating the 125th Jayanti year of Babasaheb Ambedkar , on 26th January it is important to organise a competitive competition , competitive competition and devotional competition on this subject in schools , colleges , villages and societies of the city .
Worshipping coat Indians will be able to face a big history by lifting up a step in a text with duties .
I have to know your thoughts .
Send your writing to MyGov or my portal.
I have the desire to know what young people think about the works in my country .
And I do not speak this from the government level .
We make the puppet builders of the great men very faithfully but then only we are depressed to take care of them .
On the other hand the preparation of mortality has also started .
Festivals in society have a unique importance of their own .
Sometimes these festivals bloom on pain and sometimes new standing .
But sometimes if some problem comes during these festivals then it is extremely painful .
Continuous natural dangers are coming out of every corner of the world .
We have never heard or thought of such natural problems .
Now we are taking the experience of how fast the effect of weather change is happening .
In our country in the last few days the way in which high temperature and untimely rains have occurred and in the way in Tamil Nadu the loss has occurred and its effect has also occurred on other states .
Many people died .
I am involved in the sorrow of all those families in this crisis .
The state governments do help and rescue work with full strength .
The central government also often works by putting the shoulders on the shoulders .
At present a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu .
I believe that even after this crisis falling on Tamil Nadu he will start guiding ahead with faith once again and the role of it in the development of the country will fall .
But when we see the problem all around then we need to make many changes in it .
15 years ago natural hazard was part of the agricultural department because at that time natural hazards meaning bad times are limited till now .
Today its form changes itself .
At every level it is necessary to increase our capacity .
For this the government , society , citizen , all small institutions have to work with the point of view of science .
After the earthquake of Nepal I condoled with Pakistan 's patriot Nawaz Sharif and suggested to them that we should do a joint exercise for preparing to face danger by coming together from the SAARC countries .
I am happy that the church of the countries of SAARC and the workplace of the best remedies was done in Delhi .
A good start has been done .
Today Lakhwinder Singh has taken me away from Jalandhar of Punjab .
Lakhwinder Singh is speaking from the Jalandhar district of Punjab .
We make centre farms here and also guide many to this farm .
My question is that those people who set fire to plants of peanuts or wheat in the fields do not come to know how they can guide the microbes of the earth , and how will they get rid of pollution in Delhi , Haryana , Punjab
I enjoyed listening to your question Lakhwinder Singh .
Enjoy the first reason is that you are fielding fields of central fields and you do not only do central fields yourself but also the problems of the fielders you know well .
Your concern is bad but it is not just happening in Punjab , Haryana .
This is the habit of the people of the whole of India and in a traditional way we burn the remains of the birds in such a way .
But the pain you have expressed is right only .
The first solution of this is that if we have burnt the remains of the pockets of the pockets of the pockets to tell them as true situations by administering our farmer brothers and sisters in this context then the fields are being prepared for the next pockets .
This is not just true .
We destroy them only if we do these ruins then it will be a dry fodder for animals .
Second , after burning it the upper layer of the ground burns .
My farmer brother-in-law , for a while if you think that your bones are strong , your heart is strong , your kidneys are good , all are good but if the skin of the body is burnt then what will happen
Even if heart is good we can not stay alive .
In the same way if the skin of our body is burnt then it is difficult to stay alive , in the same way the skin of the mother of the dam is burnt not only on the skin of the pigs but also burns .
If animals are used in the form of fodder , not only do their land escape , but if they put the dates made in that land then there is double benefit .
The water in those pieces is enough for that piece and even today their knees have got wax .
They have also started getting production from these pimples .
Before the bricks which had to be spent for cleaning the bricks even today the demand for the brick is increasing .
Beloved Deshbandhano , Agami , December 3 this day is celebrated in the world as an international disabled day .
On 27th November this day was celebrated as ' the third part donation day ' .
Many famous personalities along with film actress Rabina Tandon have joined it .
Due to donation of organs many affordable life can be saved .
Organ donation gives immortality in a way .
When some part from one body goes to another body then that part gets a new life but that person also gets a new life .
What can be the best donation from this
A national record of patients , organ teeth , organ transplant has been started on 27 November .
I believe that in this area also there will be widespread awareness and due to the true meaning the need will get the best help because this help can not be obtained till any part donation is done .
Like I told earlier . December 3 this day is celebrated as ' Viklang Din ' .
Physically and mentally disabled persons are also adventurous and capable .
When such people are ignored then they get tortured .
Sometimes Daya is shown on them .
But if we change our point of view towards them then we will know that these people can inspire us to live life .
You can inspire something to do .
If a small crisis comes on us then we die .
Then we remember that the crisis on me is very small .
How do they live your life
How do you do work
And therefore all these are inspirations for ourselves .
Their strength , their way of living life and strength to revert the crisis with efficiency is also responsible .
George Ahmad, I want to tell her today, she is 40-42 years old.
In 1996 Guid Ahmad was pilled by the oppressors in Kashmir .
A glacier of stomach and intestine .
Manakya was also seriously injured .
The power to stand on our legs has always been absorbed by them . Only guided Ahmad has not considered to be a victim .
How can the physically handicapped persons get improved in the facilities made available .
How can the facility of handicappedness be developed in public places , government office
They are working on these girls .
Is not their life enough to become inspirational in every corner of the country
I am aware of the lifestyle of Ahmad , his penance and his dedications on December 3 keep special memory daily .
Because of less time I have not only mentioned the guidance , but in every corner of the country many such inspirations are slowing down .
New lights are giving rise to life , new ways are showing .
Whether middle class , poor , poor , afflicted , afflicted , afflicted , afflicted person is associated with the government and government system and sometimes a civil or ethnic experience of some or the other government worker has come and some bad experience changes its vision to see the government system throughout the life .
There is also fact in this but in this government lakhs of people do such good work as well as dedicated activities which never fall in their eyes .
We had provided combined Padma Vibhushan to both the goddess Bill Gates and Milinda Gates .
They do a lot of social work in India .
Whatever they have done after their retirement and what they have done for the whole life they are spending in working for the poor .
When they come to India then they appreciate the hope that they have got the opportunity to work with the workers and tell how much of these hope workers are dedicated and troubled .
He tells how much enthusiasm they have to learn newborns , all these things .
A few days back the Orissa government gave special honor to the freedom of a hope worker .
And one hope worker of this village Mani Singh decided that I will not let anyone die due to malaria between Tedagram .
Going to every household of them , if you know of a little fever , then reach there .
There will be many more jamuna mini ' .
Millions of people, who'll be around us.
We reached them a little respect .
Such people become the biggest strength of our country .
How becomes a big partner of happiness and sorrow of society .
I glorify all such hope workers through Mani .
My beloved young friends , I am particularly active on the youth study which is internet and social media .
Not only this , he also shows to others , he may become a victim of it and he will come in his mind to add something to it .
positive energy is the biggest energy .
I invite us to participate in the construction of this nation as well .
My , beloved countrymen , the whole world is worried due to change in weather .
Climate change , global temperature increase are also discussed somewhere , care is taken and every work has started getting approval in the form of a standard before doing it .
The temperature of the earth should not increase anymore .
This is the responsibility of everyone and is also careful .
And the first way to prevent temperature is energy saving .
On 14th December is the national energy saving day .
Within the government many plans are being implemented .
I had once said that on the full moon day , after shutting down the roadside , one should stay in the light of the full moon for hours .
You should experience the light of that moon .
On seeing a woman named Noorjahan in Kanpur on TV it seemed as if she had no chance to get a lot of education .
But he is doing such work that perhaps no one has considered anything about it .
It is illuminating the lives of the poor by using the energy in the morning .
He is fighting with blindness and is embracing his nerves .
He has prepared a committee of women and started a factory of monkeys running on the morning energy and gives a loan of 100 rupees to that month .
What kind of help is being made to the workers like us
Industry, earning, equation.
The speed at which I have to go continuously is the rest of the speed .
But the beginning has improved .
In such a short time approximately 66 lakh people have got Rs . 42 thousand crore under the Prime Minister Mosque Scheme .
Whether the circular seller or the milk seller or other . small industry people and I have enjoyed this fact that out of 66 lakh women are 24 lakh women and in getting help are recommended , recommended groups , other backward class people who are standing on their feet , who are trying to run the abdomen of their families by their glory .
The Abhishek himself has told his excitement .
Many things keep coming to me .
Now Kunitar told me that in Mumbai there is a Shailesh Bhosale .
I had told at the time of my cleanliness moment that cleanliness is such that new planners will be formed from which Shailesh Bhosale showed them .
And let me say that in such a short time he has returned two lakh rupees to the bank .
He is working on making potatoes .
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor more .
Actually these people run the economy of the country .
People with small industries are the economic powers of the economy of the country .
We have to sacrifice it more .
Changal halt , but we have to do even better .
My beloved Deshbandhano , 31 October or Jayanti of Sardar Patel I had spoken of an India - best India .
These are such things by which continuous awareness should be maintained in social life .
Efficiency is a source of freedom under the Rashtrayam Jagriam Vyam .
How should the program be started
I had told about sending such information .
I was told, I got a lot of information.
But I need more information .
I expect a very special plan .
Such many things may occur .
I believe that your information will definitely be useful .
But we do exercise , it will be my aim .
In order to keep the body balanced certainly use some time of this excellent season for exercise .
Then if there is cold weather , then make the habit of china as well .
My countrymen are very nice once again.
Once again through the mother of mind you are meeting again .
India is playing the face of the fifth one day cricket between the radical and south Africa .
The name of this cricket Malik is Gandhi-Mandela Siris .
Both the parties have joined each two faces and therefore the importance of the last face has increased surely .
All my players are very happy .
Today I want to give a glimpse to the friends of Kannur Akashwani .
Worshipping wants to give it , when I started my mind then many people went to visit , among them the twelfth students of Kerala also joined with faith or program .
I have to speak about Kerala once again .
The students of the St . Mary Upper Priyamary School of Cochin Chittor of Kerala have sent me a leaf .
Initially I did n't understand , but it was surprising that these children made me the map of India by the pieces of ring .
When I read their parrots then I realized how big symbolic message they have given .
So that body part donation becomes a habit and procedure .
Those girls have written to me by writing chit that in order to give people the donation of organs through your mind ' program .
The 80 year old spring of Maharashtra Sudke Guruji has continued to run a walk .
They say that organ donation should be a festival .
Hallie also comes to me a lot of messages from the telephone .
Devesh George of Delhi has also given me a message .
I think it is very important .
In our country more than one and a half lakh people need kidney , heart and liver .
But in our country with a hundred crore population only five thousand transplants are operated i . . organ transplants .
Every year one lakh dollars are needed but only 25 , 000 people get eyes .
When four dolls are needed then we can only give one doll .
Efforts have been made to guide the states .
Some states have done a good job to speed up the efforts of hydroelectricity by reducing the work of paper .
Today I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the upper place in the organ .
Many social institutions , many NGOs have given a different direction by doing good work .
To give importance to organ transplantation , National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation , noto has been established .
The joy that happens in describing Ten is the best .
In the last month we all had seen on TV , G of Delhi .
A life was saved.
Now we celebrated the festival of Navaratri and Vijayadashmi .
After some days I am celebrating Diwali .
Eid is celebrated, Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated.
But we are celebrating one more festival in all these , we will feel respect to the countrymen , so that the pride of the country will be .
On 26th to 29th October India ' s capital New Delhi will be organised in India - Africa Farran Samet .
For the first time such big events will be held on the Indian territory .
54 African countries and Union leaders have been invited .
The population of India is as much as the population of African people .
If both populations are collected then one third of the world will be population .
And it is said that the land area of these two countries would be together for millions of years .
Later due to the Indian ocean divided this part into two parts .
And see that our efforts are such that people should also meet , come together .
During this time the Government of India has done a big program by HRD Minister .
The number of unfitted schools of CBSE have been taken in children in those schools , the program of poetry writings was organised , all of them were programmed to increase their participation .
Approximately 1600 schools participated.
Among these outside schools of India and India were included and thousands of school children had written about the desire to strengthen the Indo-Africa relations .
On the other hand the performance of the Memorial of Mahatma Gandhi ' from Porbandar , the birthplace of Mahatma which is the mobile performance i . . walking exhibition is reaching Delhi on 29th October from Porbandar to Northern state .
Millions of bullshit kids saw this exhibition and people of villages also saw this exhibition .
How important role Mahatma Gandhi had in relation to relations between Africa and India , how much was the effect of Mahatma Gandhi 's personality on these two landscapes people knew .
If seen then the Indo-Africa is together but I can see that this is the opportunity to connect people .
In summers , and children participating in it enjoy more than 1600 schools and HRD ministeries very much .
On August 15 I kept a presentation in the context of ideal village plans .
In the last month there was a workshop in Bhopal where there are ideal villages , the chief , the artists there , some members there , Government of India , state government agencies together discussed the ideal village program .
How to remember new things , remember some encouraging things .
He has chosen to play an ideal village of Parsi village Panchayani in Kunti district of Jharkhand .
With the infrastructure and management of the Adarsh village the successful attempt to reproduce people was made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand .
I enjoy the respectable heritage of Shriyut Karia Mundanji .
Well, I got a batsman from the dry.
The ruler of Andhra Ashok Ghajapati Rajuji had spent a lot in the ideal village program and he chose Dwarapudi village Panchayat of Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh as an ideal village .
Nearly 350 adult experts were taught by those children who literate them .
Seeing there is no budget in society , no circular , no special arrangement , but how big changes are brought in due to desired energy are found to be seen because of village welfare .
Although our respect is Sri Yut C . .
L . Ruwala , these are the members of Mizoram .
He chose Khwalaheelang village as an ideal village , he did a special work .
This village is very famous for production of tissues and jaggery .
How to make the village economically centres , how to do Market of the production of the village .
Ruwala ji , who is trying to make a self-sufficient village along with Adarsh village , is an adventurous character .
Is my beloved brethren , mother-in-law , mother-in-law , and it happens when there is no talk of cleanliness .
I want to remind you that after the recitation of my dear and dear countrymen , the Midia had run a special charm , after Diwali where all the things that had cracked were showed to the people from the channel .
Before census as we worry about not being accidental , but after census also it should be done .
And for this I specially want to enjoy the Middle world of Hindustan .
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on 2 October I got the opportunity to participate in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan for one year .
They see the meeting given Clean India Awards in what way they are trying .
How are people working as forest life , forest machines for this .
How many places are there in our country which have been kept so clean .
Since the mission of cleanliness campaign started , I have seen that the e-nadu of Andhra Telangan and especially Shriyut Ramuji Rao , are very bigger than the age but their enthusiasm is enjoying any youth , not less than the youth .
He has joined 15 lakh children in about 55 - 56 schools in Andhra and Telugu .
Whatever public places , stations , religious places , parks , big campaigns related to cleanliness have been run at many places .
Now these battalions themselves show the strength of shaping the dream of Swachh Bharat .
ABP News started this program with the name of ' India India Hey Mera ' and people got awareness about cleanliness and worked to train the people of the country by making it happy .
NDTV will be formed by the name of Swachh Bharati .
In Meghalaya where our state ruler Shriyut Shanmukh Nathan , he has written me a letter and mentioned this village of Mavalyanong of Meghalaya .
He has written that for the last few years this village has raised the issue of cleanliness .
Approximately every generation is dedicated to this cleaning , it is said that some years back he got the award of the cleansing wheel of Asia .
This is the important thing , we have to believe in all that our country will definitely be clean and it will be with the efforts of the countrymen , in 2001 when we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi ' s 150th birth anniversary then we will be able to say 100 crore countrymen with glory , see that we have freed our country from dirt .
My beloved countrymen , I had told this from the Red Fort on 15th August , there are some things where the Brahmins have slaughtered , have done home .
We hear all these things and this only thought in my mind , what is the need of Interview for small dogs .
I have never heard that there is such psychological in this way which can fully recognize any person taking one or two minutes .
And by this thought I had declared that we would stop the conception of childhood for this small job .
My beloved youth friends , I want to tell today that the government has completed this simple process and the posts of Group D , Group C and Group B of the Central Government will not be disturbed at the time of recruitment .
This rule will be effective from 1st January , 216 and where the process of recruitment is going on we will not be able to get rid of it , but from 1st January , 21st 16 this way will be applicable .
Then all my young friends have my best wishes .
I had declared an important plan in the last budget .
Gold has become an important source of social life in our country .
Gold can become strong , gold can become economic strength .
And it is important for every Indian to give contribution in this .
Under this we can deposit our gold in the Gold Bangkok and the Bangkok will give you a tax on it as if you get a tax by depositing your money .
Earlier we had to keep in gold locker and also take the fare of locker .
Now keep in the gold bank and the bank will give you business .
Now the countrymen , can not the golden wealth be formed
Another thing is this bond i . . a paper in Sovereign Gold Band , but the meaning of that paper is gold .
On the day when this paper returns , on the day of return you will get back the amount of the price of gold .
I am happy to say that we are bringing gold quine .
The gold ueen bringing Ashok Chakra got freedom for nearly 70 years , but till date we have been using the Foren Gold ueen only .
Gold Billion Bonds are also used in foreign countries .
We are also providing it to the common man before Dhanteras in the coming weeks . We are starting a golden bag with five grams and ten grams of Ashoka chakra .
Along with this 200 grams of gold will be available for the people .
I am confident that the new plan will bring about a new change towards economic development in which I will get my support .
On 31 October my beloved countrymen are the birth anniversary of iron male and female Vallabhbhai Patel .
One India - best Indian Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel reminded that the map of India comes out .
In the unity of India this great man has given great contribution .
India is filled with variety .
Many paths , several sects , many tales , many species , many climates , many varieties of India is full of India and this variety is our beauty .
If this is not diversity then we can not imagine the beauty of these beauty , beauty .
Therefore there is a mantra of unity of diversity .
Peace , goodwill , unity are the true burden of development .
In the last few years , on 31 October the program of Ran-For-Unity happens in the ears of the country .
The path of unity is also with the true meaning of development .
Give reverence to Sardar Saheb .
Whether we are ahead of the mantra of unity .
Beloved brother-in-law , now you have started preparing for Diwali , you will be clean at home .
You buy new things .
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country .
I am giving you lakhs of beauty for the pilgrimage of Diwali .
Because of boiling fire starts flowing , there is a lot of harm to the children because of boils .
I tell every parent that the pleasure of the day is lost but do not let the accident happen , neither do the loss of the child of our family nor do you think and have to wipe out .
On the second day of Diwali , my dear countrymen , I am going to the bottom of Briton .
Government of India and state government will be groups of these classes of society , tribals , backwards , gives such scholarships to children , who go to study abroad .
I believe that when our children will learn in Britain , then instead of Babasaheb will become this motivation ground for some learned country in life , this message was given by Babasaheb , so I tell you that because of my journey to Britain I have thrilled , so many years this subject was the same .
Now because of the building being connected to the names of Babasaheb Ambedkar you can estimate how much joy will happen to people like me .
I have got another chance in London , to ignore the statue of Lord Vishweshwar .
Many years before Lord Vishweshwar had done the work for democracy , the Empire of Woman , it is necessary to study it .
The inauguration of the statue of Lord Vishweshwar on the land of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India think about , keeping in view .
You should be associated with the mother of my dear countrymen .
It was discussed by speaking to the government officials .
Some people write their problems , try to solve problems .
In countries like India we should learn many languages .
I got a chance to learn some languages but how can I learn that language
But I am an admirer of the sky that this heart is spreading in their regional language in every state at 8 o'clock in the night .
My favourite countrymen have a lot of gladness once again.
Jai Hind
Gelanshi on 3 October rosary, I will get the fate for the first time to settle my mind.
Public power has immense importance .
There is a basic idea in my life and because of this my faith is in the strength of the people .
But what I learned from the mother-in-law of the mind , what I feel , from that I can tell you that the power of the people is incomplete than that .
Your ancestors have to say that Janta Janadan is a part of God .
From the experiences coming out of the mind I can tell that there is a big power in the thoughts of our ancestors , because I have experienced this .
I want to ask for information from the people for the reason of the heart... just two or four information.
But in lacs of numbers people got active and sent information .
This is a big power .
When people were watching it then they also felt that the feeling of depression , misery waiting for girls would have to be changed now .
It was a silent revolution.
Keeping in front of Indian tourism dolls I tell the citizens , Incredible India , invaluable India . You sent a changal photograph to me on the gallery of tourism .
People from all parts of Hindustan sent photographs in lakhs .
The tourism departments of the Government of India or state government also never want that we have so rich wealth with us .
There was a common thing on one monastery and in this the government had not spent any money .
People do all this .
Today I can tell with great joy that in the last one year the sale of khadi has doubled .
While speaking in the middle of the heart , I am telling once , in the poor house , the children are crying , we see the picture of their poor mother .
Do they not get gas cylinders
If the government works with hands in hands of this society then in the form of a catalyst for social change the government can work more .
Every small matter was considered to be small and tried to connect themselves to the country .
What could be the greater joy than this
I decided to use a new experiment in the mind .
Discouraging the citizens of the country that your question , your information , your discovery reach me through the phone .
I'll take care of it in the mind.
I am happy that more than five thousand advanced from all over the country . Siachen , Kutch , Kamarup , Kashmir or Kanyakumari .
There is no such state in Hindustan from where the citizens did not call off .
This is a kind of pleasant experience .
The citizens of all the colonies told them Mandals , ideas .
Some of them I have heard myself , but my spoon works on the other problems .
You may have taken one or two minutes to call this telephone , but the delivery , thought and problems received from it for me are important .
On this the entire government will definitely work .
What is the importance of radio for such blind people  I am aware of this .
I have seen from a new point of view and many good things , good cases , government is enough to become sensitive .
I want to suggest Pantapadh Nrandra Modi , inspire the people of India through the breeze of the mind that maximum use of soil butterflies in the daytime .
On the day of my dear countrymen , on the day of Ganesha Chaturthi I got a chance to stay with the soldiers of the Sanyadala for two - three hours .
Water , land and sky protecting nausea stations and air services .
The war that took place in 1965 with Pakistan was completed fifty years .
We just hear about the moments of glory , respect , context , the adventure , sacrifice of our soldiers , at that time photography , swimming system are also available , but through this exhibition the experience of the sacrifice of the soldiers , the moments of that expedition comes .
Then that fight is like Hajifir , whether in the north or in Chamida , seeing the scene of victory achieved near Hajipir Pass remains thrilling on the organs and the gloriousness waiting for Indian sanya comes in the mind .
If you want to get history then you will have to understand its small problems as well .
Because of history , their bondage remains with our children .
If the breasts of history break then the possibility of history getting complete rest .
A little boy has given an order to the father-in-law but in the dragon he forgot to tell his own name .
To achieve solutions , I announced the campaign in the context of clean India on October 2 and I can tell us that after independence there is a discussion on the first relation , cleanliness .
There were also vaccines on our government .
I also start listening to a lot of things , Modiji used to tell big things about cleanliness but what to say .
I do not feel bad on hearing this , but from this I have a good thing that in relation to the country there is talk about the cleanliness of India .
And look at the other side , on the other hand , on the other hand , when both of these young children speak about cleanliness then there is no such thing as part of this for the country .
This movement is starting , awareness about ideas , discomfort and cleanliness is visible .
Due to this the government will also become active , working , doing work becomes unnecessary .
In the year 2001 when we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhiji in India , we have worked towards that direction to bring the dreams of Mahatma Gandhiji from now on .
You are tired of what Mahatma Gandhi says .
At one place he says that if time comes to choose one out of two freedom and cleansing then I will give priority to cleanliness , cleanliness for Gandhiji after independence was more important than independence .
Gulshan Arora from Delhi has mygov.
We get constant inspiration from the life of my dear countrymen , great men .
These great men are considered as ideals , these fundamental rays are not working automatically .
Everyone who lives for the country and dies for the country is inspiring us .
These days are the chances of remembering all these great men .
On 25th September in Pundit Dayal Upadhyayaya , Mahatma Gandhi on 2 October , Lal Bahadur Shastri , Jayaprakash Narayanji on 1 October , Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31 October , I also tell a lot that this country is very famous Vasundara .
You can take any tactics , from the point of view of history somebody or the other majestic name will be associated with that star .
Especially for October 2 I revive you once again.
On 2 October prayer is the Jayanti of Bapuji Mahatma Gandhiji .
The work which the government can not do by giving precaution by spending a lot , it will be done because of a small activity , help .
This is the same thing as the life force and therefore we do this work that I regret you again .
Beloved countrymen , my mind is filled with joy because of one thing .
Chandra Bose had arranged all the arrangements with the eminence of Subhash Babu .
Chanda Bose and his family took this work on the mind and in the last few weeks it was found that fifty more native , family chief residents of Subhashbabu are coming .
You can imagine how happy it is for me .
These opportunities are available to the leaders , possibly the first together , together , to meet Pantpraadhan Niwas .
But more than that I have enjoyed because there has never happened before as the residence of the Pentagons , which I would be lucky to do in the month of October .
More than 50 innocent , family , living in some different countries , all the cases are coming out .
How happy is the moment for me .
I want to disintegrate the patriots , so that you will wake up the youth in the future of recording , so that the youth will increase the participation of the youth in the future and in order to choose and run the government , the youth will be able to make a very important cooperative .
Those youths who have not yet registered their names , I hope that they will be registered and will also do it .
On the seventh student of Dakshij Pandey met me in Anarash Hindu Vidyapeeth , in the central college he learns the seventh century , is the same hustle-bustle .
Dandaga is self-confidence near it .
In this young age if I see her interest in physiotherapy then I would have read a lot .
The daughter of Sadavrat Patel living in Sunderpur in Varanasi .
On the other hand his elders said , Yes , but the three mathematicians take the book in hand , then in the evening everyone opens the mouth , history and in the evening .
We really felt surprised to all the family members that I was very impressed .
Sometimes such children get the chance of popularity , but I do not know anything about Sonam .
Devaana has given me a power but I want to see it .
In my Kashi journey the Yoga of visiting two children came .
Similarly the meeting of these two children was decided to stay in mind .
Many people are suggesting new tasks by the medium of mind .
Seeing this , what does Sandeep of Haryana say  Sandeep Haryana , the mother of Sir Mana do once in a month , you do every week because you get a lot of inspiration by hearing your words .
Sandeepji , what should you do with me
Once in a month I also have to make a lot of effort , I have to plan time .
Nowadays it stays once in the month .
Just a year's full of mind.
You know how much use of Subhashbabu radio .
From Germany , when they started their radio center and for freedom movement the citizens of Hindustan should always give information from this radio center .
The beginning of Azhad Hind radio was done by a weekly battery .
He used to run this radio transmission from English , Hindi , Bengali , Marathas , Punjabi , Parsi Urdu .
I am also waiting for one year while talking to me from the sky .
Keep sending your information , ideas , disposal .
The government also gets benefit from it .
Reforms start .
Your contribution , your participation is very expensive , incomparable .
Once again we liked everyone very much .
The citizens of South India are colored in comparison to Onam and in the same time the whole country celebrated the sacred value of Raksha Bandhan .
Keeping in mind the issue of social security the Government of India has started several new schemes for the common citizens .
I am enjoying this as well as accepting the plan .
I had made such a deliberation that we should give our partner these security plans to the conservation of the detention system .
From the beginning of this scheme till date I have got information about the involvement of 11 crore families and even though the parents have got the benefit of these plans .
I enjoy many acquaintances of the magnificent festival of demonstrating all the parents .
Today while talking to me I have spent a year taking a large amount of money in the reproductive system .
The important part of economy is also the banking area and this arrangement has been strengthened to reach the poor house as well .
Today more than 100 lakh banks are working in friends throughout the country .
Young people have also got employment .
We will be happy to hear that in this one year for organizing 1 lakh 31 thousand economic literacy camps to connect the banking sector , economy and poor humans .
Do not stop eating just by opening .
Now thousands of citizens are capable of overdraft facilities under this reproductive program and they have also made that facility .
It has been believed that poor people can get money from the bank .
I enjoy all the time again and tell all the poor brothers and sisters who are eating in the bank to tell them that they are with your bank .
This bank is yours , do not leave it now .
I have brought the bank to you , now it is your work to keep it in mind .
Due to the incidents happening in Gujarat , due to the clutches of violence the whole country became unhealthy and it is social that if something happens in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar then its clutches settle the whole country first .
But in a very short time all my swelling brothers in Gujarat brought the situation under control .
The situation would not worsen , therefore played an active role and once again Gujarat started on the path of peace .
Peace , unity and harmony are only walking on the right path and towards the path of development .
Development is the answer to our problems .
I got the opportunity to see the scholars of Sufi sect .
I got an opportunity to hear their thoughts and tell you very well , as if you listen to some music , I felt as if you are talking to them .
The choice of their words , the way to speak i . . generosity , sympathy in the Sufi tradition , in which there is a lure of music , I came to speak to each of these scholars of that literature .
I want a lot of shit.
Often there is a need to reach the world as a whole of Islam .
The Sufi sect which has been associated with love and charity will find this message far away from which human society will be better , Islam will also be better and I also tell others that we are of any community , understand Sufi sect , Sufi tradition .
In the coming few days there is a chance and I understand that I will get this invitation .
Among the many countries of the world the scholars of the Buddhist tradition , Bodhgaya are coming here , about the goodness of human community , welfare , global topics are being discussed .
For this I will get an invitation , I am happy to get invitations on coming here .
The first prime minister of India Pandit Nehru Bodhgaya had gone here .
I have a chance to go here in Bodhgaya with such scholars worldwide , this is a very happy moment for me .
My beloved farmer brother Bhaginino, I want to tell you my favourite thing once again.
I would have been supposed to have this subject either before or by the mind.
You must have heard me, in my address, from the public meetings, from the hearts of the mind.
Every time I came to tell this that the Government of India has opened its mind in the matter of the land which is going on in the topic of the law .
This means that the situation which was before the establishment of my government has now been established again .
My farmer brothers and sisters , I want to give an account that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a declaration for us .
That mantra is the welfare of the village , the poor , the farmer .
That is why on 15th August we were telling that not only the agricultural department but also the welfare department of agriculture and welfare department would be established .
We are doing this decision instantly .
Two days before the war of 1965 , 50 years were completed and when the subject of the war of 1965 came out then the socially red artistic scientific sciences were remembered .
In the war of 65 I salute the heroes because of which India got victory .
We will always get inspiration from such incidents of history .
The way I got the opportunity to see the people of Sufi sect in the last week , I got a pleasant experience .
I got an opportunity to speak with them for hours to meet naming scientists all over the country .
I am happy to know that there was an opportunity to listen to them and considering that India is doing good work in the field of science , in many directions .
Our scientific problems are doing excellent work .
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that if it is inspiring for me then along with it it would be better to learn something new .
And I saw how many young scientists were speaking enthusiastically and many dreams were visible in their eyes .
In the past I am telling that students should move towards the field of science .
After this sitting I feel that there are many opportunities , there are many chances .
I want to tell again that my young friends want to look at science , our educational institutions inspire students for it .
It is written about Kaushalya development .
Sriman Prakash of Chidambaram of Tamil Nadu has filled the needs of good teachers for primary education .
The improvements in the field of education have been filled .
Especially I want to tell my young friends one thing .
In the speech made from the Red Fort on August 15, I would say that for the lower level job, what's the interview
And when the grandsons come for childhood then every poor family , widow come in this thought that who will get the scuffle or who will get the scuffle
Do not know what words are used .
Everyone gets a run and perhaps it is also a reason behind the lower surface .
For this lower level of choice , even though the symmetrica of childhood does not apply to them , I am saying in my 15th August speech and I am happy to say that in such a short period only 15 days have been taken , the government has taken a lot of steps .
The information is being sent and the decision of not keeping the child in mind for small posts is going to be almost unsuccessful .
It is unfortunate that in our country about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die immediately after delivery and delivery .
It is worrisome and horrible .
In fact there has been a lot of improvement in this regard .
But now we have to save our mothers , newborns .
We look at the telephone cart but do not pay attention , but we do not see clearly from the present utensils .
Along with pure water it is important to keep small things clean at home .
Life is extremely expensive .
It is not right to ignore the intoxicated water , depression of cleansing this cause of death .
In the entire country about 514 centers dengue test is being done invaluable .
The time from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali means the time of many festivals in our country .
Wear cleanliness of each of our festivals , see this quality of cleanliness coming in your own nature .
Now we will not get the privilege of paying life to the country , but for the country only the fate of the world is available , so I always say .
Two young , two brothers of our country , Dr . of Nashik of Maharashtra .
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr .
How everybody is trying to bring forward the country and this is the way it fills the respects of listening .
Sometimes because of lack of understanding we do injustice to our youth .
But in the case of youth my experience is different .
Sometimes we know new things by talking to them , we get to learn .
I have taken the story of Sunday on my bike , many youths telling me .
One day in a week there is a decision of such things as cycle-day .
For health , environment the joy of being good and youth goes well and they say .
The quantity of cycling used in many houses in our country increases , for which many increases .
This is a good attempt to save the environment , to stay healthy and today I am happy to mention that two youths of my country have gathered a flag of India in America , hence the youth of India are also thinking about this .
Today I enjoy the Maharashtra regime .
That memorial will inspire us to work for decorated , absorbed , afflicted , wandered .
I enjoy the Maharashtra regime for these two programs having the honor of Ambedkar .
The country can be neglected ahead by putting hand on the shoulders .
We're all very blessed, very blessed
It will definitely help its farmer brothers , sisters for sale of buyers .
I remembered one more thing like this and enjoyed the heart .
The raw lentils and oilseeds should always be dissolved in our country .
The poor person feels bitter , in the food , a little oil takes place for the vegetable .
I enjoyed the cereals which have come in this year 50 percent of the production of cereals and about 33 percent increase in the production of oilseeds .
For this I enjoy my farmer brothers and sisters .
My dear countrymen on 26th July this star has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Day .
The same thing as the fields of this country is also the soldiers .
In Kargil war one of our soldiers fell on hundred enemy soldiers .
This war of Kargil was not just a war fought on the border , it was part of every city of India , every village of India .
Those young sons , brothers who were fighting enemies in Kargil were fought for the mothers , daughters .
The females did not dry any more henna taken out on their hands for marriage , seeing their slaves young children , whom they felt as young as they were again fighting , keeping their father ' s finger who did not learn to walk anymore fought such children .
Because of the sacrifice of all these people today India can speak correctly in front of the world .
After coming to power in 2414 only on 26 July we started the May Gov Mohammad .
To connect each citizen with the development work , to increase their participation in the public sector we started this signal spot .
And today , after one year , I am happy to say that about two crore citizens have met this sign place of MyGovi .
About five and a half lakh citizens registered the reactivity , and more than fifty thousand citizens registered information on PMO APLICATIONS , for this they took out time , this work was considered important .
Is it appropriate for such people to get rid of the ticket of the train
If seen then this thing looks smaller at the top , but the government did not even remember this thing , no one had considered it .
But in the case of Akhilesh the government had seriously considered and today a separate arrangement for ticket reservation has come into effect for its poor intellectuals .
Halls become new logos , tu lines are formed , programs are drawn up . very good information comes on MyGovi .
It feels that new winds are flowing in the governance system .
One feels a new consciousness .
On the coming fifteenth August the information of My Gov has started to be given to me in my speech .
From Chennai Sumitara Raghavchari has suggested a lot of things .
What is happening in my speech on 15th August , for this the citizens of the country will suggest the problem . This is a good idea .
I believe you will definitely get good information .
I feel careful of one thing , it reaches you .
I do not have to preach anybody , I do not aim to escape from the responsibility of the central government , state government or local health organization .
As soon as I saw a scene of a accident in Delhi two days ago and after the accident the scooter driver was disturbed in the wounded state for about ten minutes .
Hoshakotta Akshay of Bangalore , Amay Joshi of Pune , Praswa Kakunje of Murbidri of Karnataka have expressed his concern over this issue by other people .
Every four minutes one person dies in road accident .
But I despise the parents , then they will be able to take care of the four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-f-four-f-four-f-four-f-the-four-f-four-f-the-four-free-free-
In this regard the government has taken a lot of new dharnas , has taken a step forward , to advise the citizens about road safety , whether it is the mechanism of road drawing or the problem of getting immediate help to the victims of accident .
Keeping in mind all these things we are going to enforce the passing and security reason .
We are supposed to take up many important steps in the coming days to save the national road safety storage and road safety acts of Arakhada .
That plan is the castles treatment for the roads here from Gurgaon , Jaipur , Badoda , Mumbai , Ranchi , Rangano and Mondia .
This means how to get immediate medical help in 50 hours after the accident in the accident , it is near to pay attention to it , not on whom the bill will be filled . We are giving priority to getting treatment from all the points of view .
To give information about the accident the total free phone number of 1033 will be in the whole country , the facility of politics or all the things .
There is no accident in the root because it is important to pay more attention to this because life of one or the other is more important .
Sometimes I tell you, the worker will be comfortable.
In the past few days I remembered some things , I felt that I should talk to you about that .
But how to bring Chaitanya in the work taken in hand
Biswal has shown this victory of his favorite art capabilities with his work .
There is such a possibility that their pictures will be spoken now and I got information about one more thing .
In the middle of Madhya Pradesh , the whole of the government officials of Harda district , a different work started by the union touched my mind .
I liked this work of them , while listening to Mohammad Operation Malayu , these elders started , we will feel that there is something different .
But he gave a new turn to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , this is a very important thing in it .
There is a camp named Kasla near Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh .
Or the people of the village made toilets by making a fascinating joyful way .
Now the well of this village does not go open for the toilet and when the work of building the toilet is completed , then celebrate some festival as much as Kasla village celebrated Anandotsav .
This excellent example of how changes occur in the origins of social life , how changes the mind of the people , and how the citizens of the country are on the path of progress .
From Guwahati Bhavesh Decca has written about questions related to the North-Eastern province .
If seen then in the eastern province people are active .
When we go to the village , we will speak to the chief ministers of the administration there , people will speak this officially to the representatives and citizens .
To get rid of this problem you will know their problems what is possible by the Central Government .
A good effort , attempt to go eastern from Delhi ,
My dear countrymen , the success of Mangal Mohammad is such a thing that everyone will feel respect and joy .
We know this information but we do not pay attention to it .
I always tell the IAS chief ministers through the government , going to any school , college near two to four hours in a week to contact the students there .
This work is difficult , but it has to be done .
During examination there is no need therefore do not break in the study of children .
If you want to start a small big business , industry in the village then you will have wages .
In some places , to enjoy mobile , one has to go to another village .
We must do this , we have started it .
Today I felt to speak to me on different subjects of mind .
We all want my beauty to look at it.
Definitely send your information , new imagination for August 15 , I will definitely get that useful .
The heart of the mind, from 2019
Something is less , but I feel ashamed .
While sitting in our humans , in a very light environment , in the form of a sweet swing between the families of 130 crore people , we were listening to many things , some things were talking again .
During some time your things , inspiration for ourselves .
This is how the period of holidays have been done , we can imagine .
Maybe on Sunday, the last Sunday in the month... at 11 in the morning, you met
I do something 'miss ' , but I felt every moment .
And at the time when I do the mother of the mind , even if I speak together , and that word is probably mine , the voice is mine , but that stories are yours , yours is for men , the supreme is yours .
I used only my words and my words .
There was a feeling of absolute reliability in the mind .
Once in mind , now selects have finished , then immediately speak four things by making them in your mind .
But then thought , no .
Your program is that weekend and it should continue like that .
But these Sundays only brought a lot of wait .
Little , very simple , simple , simple things are also becoming reasonable for changing in society , life .
This sequence gives rise to a new energy , pure metaphysician in one way , giving strength to the metaphysical , energy of the newborn , this sequence has to be moved forward by starting like this .
In the last few months many messages have come in which innumerable people have to say that they are missing the mother of the mind .
When I read this message then at that time I feel screaming .
This is my journey from ' Aham ' to ' Vyyam ' .
This magnificent translation done with me for me is one part of the experience of my spiritual journey as well .
In the Dhamdhumi of Chununki I went to Kedarnath , many people have considered a lot of questions about this .
You have the right to consider such a question .
And I can understand that you are also supposed to know the answers of these questions .
One tells me , the feeling of a little relievedness was created in my mind , in the valleys of Kedar , in that solitude cave , perhaps the chance of filling the pocket in that solitude must have been obtained , so I feel .
The way many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar poetry , then your attempt to sacrifice a positive thing , I feel seven times from your speech .
The utensils which come for the mother 's mother who get input are completely different from routine i . . daily government work .
Sometimes the leaf sent by you also becomes the reason for inspiration for me in a way .
Sometimes the task of holding my thought process does some words of yours .
The feelings of the country and society understand me from the people .
At the same time people also tell us what is our answer to these problems .
In the leaf people ask for their problems , along with it what is the answer , it also writes , but let me see .
The couple of questions express their answer , some or the other new imagination , obvious or indirectly .
The mother of man is like a glass for the country and society .
Today, my mind is full of joy.
In the past I had finally said that now we met for three-four months , some of them had taken out the state meaning . People said , How much confidence is there for the Modiji , how much confidence is there for them .
This self-confidence was not of some moods .
So this belief was the foot of your faith .
All of you used to take the form of faith .
And therefore very simplely I had said in the mother-in-law of Akher that now I want to speak to you after a few months .
You are the bus stand here and you have only given me a chance to speak again .
If we move with this feeling then the order of the mother of the mind started as before .
The movement remained limited till the factory.
In the mind and mind of people , there would be a stroke in the heart .
There is a kind of glimpse in the minds of publicity .
The time when you get food at the time of time , at that time you do not understand whether hunger is .
In the same way nobody smiles the importance of democratic rights , at the same time understands .
During the time of bringing somebody would smile , every citizen of the country would seem to be smiling .
Those things which we have never used , even if someone has laughed , they are painful , they get tortured .
Some arrangements have been made in the tour of India , in which publicity has also been roaming here .
There is also a need for deterioration to run the social system .
There is also a need for law and order .
But India can tell glory , glory that for us there are verses of publicity on us more than law , rule .
Publicity is our culture .
Publicity is our heritage , our tradition .
And while roaming around this warmth we have seen a little bigger .
That is why the country had not only given us for ourselves but also for the protection of democracy a complete choice .
The priceless folk treasure that we have achieved is very easily in the house .
In India more than 61 crore people selecting the publicity of 20019 have lost their lives .
But if the world 's spectacle is of Mandai then I tell , if one leaves China then more people than the population of any other country have lost their mortality in India .
In comparison to the popularity of 219 the number of scholars dictated is more than the total population of America , it is almost double .
The population of the entire Europe is more than that , the total population of India is in India .
We can imagine how large item and human child is needed to cross this choice .
Millions of teachers , officers and employees have been able to cross the select by working day and night .
In order to achieve this great knowledge of folk dynasty about three lakh security workers of the paramilitary group have lost their responsibility .
At the same time 200 lakh polio workers of different states also performed the work .
We can imagine how much business of total selection was done .
One person should not refrain from his maternal grandson , for this all the characteristics must have been supplied with the right to pay their maternity .
Arunachal Pradesh-like inaccessible areas, just a woman was being made a center of mortality.
We will feel new to know that the maximum number of selected people had to travel for two days to reach that remote place .
Apart from this or selective admonitions such a thing has happened .
I enjoy every person involved in this election process and I bow down to the awakening minds of India .
My beloved countrymen , you must have heard many times from my mouth , but the book is like my master .
We can go to books instead of flowers while welcoming everybody .
On hearing this people have started to welcome the books at many places .
I have recently visited the book of Kunitar 's popular Kahaniya of Premchand ' or Shirshakacham ' .
I liked this meeting very much .
Continuously , I could not get a lot of time , but in the journey I got a chance to read some of his stories again .
Premchand has made a real picture of society in his stories , while reading it the painting of that time starts building in front of his eyes .
Every penance , every thing written by them becomes alive .
In their stories the feelings of the whole of India are included .
While reading the story named ' Nasha ' he wrote , my mind will run on its own asking questions of economic poisoning in society .
I remember the period of my youth.
On the economic species of society our youths used to have debate overnight .
In this the sensitivity of a child , the immense mother of her life in her mind , the maturity present in the thoughts in such a small age was from these things .
The time when Hamid of 4 . years comes to his life by smiling in the fair , at that time human sentiment reaches the highest peak , at that time in the end the bowing reader has to become extremely emotional .
In this story one gets to read a very living picture in the interesting way of the life of a poor farmer .
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village based in the entire jungle of Idukki .
Here's primary teacher P.
Murlidharan and one fourth tea - shopping drinks .
Whi.
Chinnathambi or both of them work tirelessly to start the library.
At one time both of these books used to make knots and books used to be run in their villages in the jungle over their backs .
Today this library , along with the tribal children here is working to show everyone a new direction .
The ' Gujarat ' of Gujarat has proved to be a good success .
In this campaign lakhs of people participated in all the activities and they read books .
In today 's digital age , during the times of Google Guru I prefer to you that you must keep books for a while to keep books in your daily activities .
My beloved countrymen , people in our country not only consider the present time , but they also seem to think about the future environment , this thing is joyful for me .
I was reading the reaction that you sent on ' Narendramodi app ' and ' Myagav ' , at that time I remember , many people have written a lot about the problem of water .
Besides the Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum , Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar , Success Sharma , Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the environment related to water .
Despite the mother-in-law, the mother's blessings should be received... the mother's blessings of water should be kept on herself.
Due to lack of water every year in many parts of the country there is bad time .
We save only eight percent water , therefore now it is necessary to break this problem .
The way we all found out the answer from public participation , public strength , the same way on the problem of water , one hundred and thirty crore people will find out the answer with the help of all the capabilities , the help of all , and determination .
Water is the most important , keeping in mind that the country has now been able to make a new water power ministry .
By this it will be possible to take immediate decisions on all the topics related to water .
A few days back I tried to do something very fast .
I wrote letters to the Sarpanches of the country , gram chiefs .
To save water , to make accumulation of water , do not leave drops of rain , to save rain water the village chiefs should speak all the villages , sit together .
It has been decided to save each drop of water in villages and to save the water of rain .
In today 's ' Baat ' program I want to listen to us about a serpent ' .
The people there have proved to play an active role for water conservation once again .
To save water all the village chiefs , all the sarpanchs , who showed activity , my wife very much liked all these .
Many structures of the country have made such a project of water conservation .
In a way this whole village has got an opportunity to work .
People in that village are now in the nearby villages as if they have come under the guidance of making water temples .
If you do social efforts then you get very good positive results , I have already told it .
To die on water conservation in the entire country one special famine can not be there .
For this efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways .
But the goal of all is the same and that means water saving , water conservation .
Work is going on in Punjab only after improving the dress lines .
Because of these work the problem of sucking water is going on .
Thimaipalli in Telangnaam , due to the formation of water pigeons here the life of the people of the village is changing .
In Rajasthan Kabir Dham has made big changes due to small lakes built in the fields here .
I was reading about the collective efforts made by Vellour, Tamilnadu, where 200 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
The women in the middle of the gharwal together are doing the work of ' Renwater Harvesting ' in a very good way , but also in my reading .
In this way many attempts are being made .
While everybody will participate in the work of water conservation , water will be saved at the same time .
Today through ' Mon Ki Baat ' I have a guidance of three things to the countrymen .
My first aim is - that is the way the countrymen will give the form of a movement of cleanliness to the countrymen , the same way start a mass movement for water conservation .
We envisage saving every drop of water together and I believe that water is the Prasad given by God .
Earlier it was said that the spinal cord of Paris was made of iron and gold .
I say , water is precedent , and i . . touching water new life is formed .
To save every drop of water a awareness campaign should be started .
Make the society aware , do the job of connecting the society .
We all take care of those traditional methods of water conservation , I donate such a glory .
If any of us has got the opportunity to go here at the birthplace of the worshippers - Porbandar then they have seen this place . There is another house behind the house of worshippers .
That is why I often say , if someone goes to the Kirti temple , then definitely see this water harvesting stick .
Let us go , then , by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation , people are encouraged for water conservation .
We can use Janshaktiforjalshakti in your knowledge .
My dear countrymen , I have to express my glory for one more thing .
The presidents of many countries around the world , patriots , honored persons , general citizens celebrated Yoga Day in your country , they gave me information through Twitter .
On that day the whole world looked like a happy , happy family .
That is why the spread of yoga is a great work of social service .
Then why do not you recognize those who do such services and do not support them
In the year 2001 the declaration of Pant Prince Portuguese was made about giving excellent contribution to the work of promoting yoga and development .
This thing is inspiring .
Now yoga is starting , then in this area Indians are not on some backwards .
Bihar Yoga Vidyalayas , Munger have also been honored , these institutions have been dedicated to yoga processing for the past few decades .
My dear countrymen , our journey is starting today . new feeling , new experience , new project , new potential , but I will continue to wait for my challenges .
Let's go, let's keep meeting, keep talking.
I hear your feelings , keeps in mind .
Sometimes they try to wake up that feeling .
Keep getting your blessings like this .
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again we met at the time of the mother of the next month .
We all have great blessings
Manki Baat, February 2019
After the martyrdom of the Veer Sainiks in the rigorous Hall of Pulwama there has been an intense feeling of sadness in the minds of the people of the country .
Sympathy is being expressed all around about the martyrdom of the martyr Jawan and his family .
The feeling of acute sadness in the opposite of this kind of adventurous violence is in our minds and our minds , the same feelings are convinced in the minds of every countrymen and humanity - the humanitarian community of all over the world .
For the protection of India - mother , sacrifice of our lives - I promise all the brave sons of the country .
Our armed team has always shown unparalleled adventure and performance .
Where he has shown wonderful ability to establish peace .
There only he has the work of giving adventurous performance to the killers in his own language .
How the work was done within 100 hours , it must have been seen by all of us .
The father of Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in the middle of Bihar Ramniranjanji also showed sympathy in such a painful context which is inspiring all of us .
We send our second son to fight against enemies as well and if necessary we fight ourselves , they have said .
The entire country is saluting the invaluable adventure of Minaji , the wife of Shahid Prasad Sahu of Jagatsinghpur of Odisha .
They have also decided to fulfil one of their own children in CRPF ' .
The time in which Gulla or village in Jharkhand the participants of Shahid Vijay Sharon wrapped in the Tricolor , at that time their executed son told us that we would also be filled with salt .
The humility shown by these innocent boys is that today there is a feeling of every small child in India .
Such feelings are seen to be expressing in the houses and houses of our brave , mighty martyrs .
We have no gallantry , it is not an exception that they are not their family exception .
Then whether he is the family of Vijay Maurya of Deoria or the mother-father of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six year old son of Kota Shahid Hemraj .
We will not need to see the ancient events of history to know what it means .
This is a moving example in front of our eyes .
These examples are the source of inspiration for the bright future of India .
My beloved countrymen , we were waiting for the national military memorial for many years , now this wait is going to end soon .
Therefore it is natural for the people to have curiosity , excitement in their minds .
Sri Yut Omkar Shetty , a resident of Udupi in Karnataka , has expressed happiness about the completion of the work of National War Memorial i . . the National War Memorial .
This memorial is such a place to keep the story of the great devotee of his life sacrificed for the protection of the nation .
I decided to make it by considering it as an inspirational memorial in the country .
We decided to set up a national military memorial and every work was started .
That is , on 25th February this national military memorial , we are supplied to our luxury .
This exactly the country is trying to quit the rains on its own .
The place where the hearts of Delhi are called , this new memorial is being built near the Indian Gate and Amar Jawan Jot .
To meet this national military memorial i . . to meet any pilgrimage the holy work is in the sight of the countrymen , I believe it .
After getting freedom this is the symbol of thanksgiving of the country i . . this national military memorial .
The construction of this memorial is demonstrating the invaluable thrill of our American soldiers .
The concept of this national military memorial is based on four central circles in which paintings are from the birth of a soldier to a weekend .
The light of Amar Chakra is the symbol of the martyrdom of the soldiers .
After this the immunity chakra is reflecting safety .
There are queues of dense trees in this chakra .
These trees are the symbols of the soldiers and are also giving a message to the citizens of the country , every hour the soldiers are on the border and the countrymen are safe , this is the message .
Somebody will come here with the purpose of getting information about the martyrdom of these heroic soldiers , at that time they will be safe of the country , we will live , develop the country , therefore we will be able to get information of the soldiers of offerings to our life country .
In the development of the country the rays expressed in the words of great and invaluable contributions of our armed parties , police and paramilitary parties are not really possible .
We should all express our gratitude towards men and women police workers who are constantly working for our protection , but I feel .
We must visit the national military memorial and the National Police Memorial , I hope that .
That is why other people should also visit this sacred place , such inspiration will be available and they will also be excited to meet this holy place .
At that time when I was reading the reaction from ourselves , at that time I will take care of the extremely humorous reactions of Aitish Mukopadhyay ji .
He has written that on 3 March , 1900 the British had discontinued Birsa Munda .
And the point of Yoga is that on 3 March everyday there is also the pleasure of Jamshedji Tata .
Both of them have come from a different family background , only these two have enriched the tradition , heritage and history of Jharkhand .
In ' Man Ki Baat ' Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata are devoted to devotional stories i . . one way the glorious history of Jharkhand and tradition .
These two great species are not Jharkhand but the name of the whole country is Ujjwal Kel .
The whole country is thankful to the contribution given by them .
Today , whose name can be taken as an inspirational person to our newborns as a guide then that is Lord Birsa Munda .
While sleeping Birsa Munda the British had caught them by wrapping , showing excessive quadruple .
Do you know that the British had to accept the path of such a reversal to catch Munda
Because they were scared of the British monkeys constructing a large empire .
Lord Birsa Munda just with the help of his traditional wealthy manufacturers used to completely destroy the British government decorated with guns and guns .
Actually if people get such an inspirational leadership then social desire becomes stronger than the strength of the enemies present in front of the enemy .
Lord Birsa Munda did not only associate with the British for state freedom but also fought for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
They showed something all around in their madness .
The blindness of devoured and absorption brought light like the rays in life .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed 25 years of age .
Like Birsa Munda , the supplication of Mother India has happened in every part of the country .
But fortunately , the stories of these great people 's sacrifice , valor and sacrifice have not reached the new generation .
If the personality of Lord Birsa Munda gave us the feeling of existence then personality like Jamshedji Tata created a very big institution in the country .
For the bright future it is necessary for science , technological and industry to become the center of India , this Jamshedji Tata would be cheerful .
Not only this he established many world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel .
Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekanand Ji had met in the ship once during the journey of America , at that time it was discussed on various subjects .
In this discussion only the Indian Science Institute has been formed .
My beloved countrymen , the mother of our country , father-in-law Morarajibhai Dasai was born on 29 February .
This wires come only once in four years .
Morarjibhai having a simple , peaceful personality is one of the most disciplined leaders of the country .
Most of the times in relation to independent India the sale of economics is also on the name of Morarjibhai Desai .
During the time when the country 's publicity had come into crisis , in that difficult time Morarji Dasai made India 's familiar leadership .
Morarjibhai Dasai used to bend himself in the agitation started in protest against the revolt for the protection of democracy .
They had to pay a lot of price in their old age .
During that time the government used to put them in Turunga by tempting them .
In 1977 when the Janta Party asked for a choice , at that time it became the prime minister of the country .
Accordingly it is clear that the pen of the knee is not harmed even during the renovation of the basic rights received according to 200 and 21 .
The way Lokshahi was executed in Laibani Laun , 1975 , the same thing could never be repeated again in the future , so Morarji Bhai had repeated the incident .
Today again and again I offer this great leader a devotion .
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of enthusiasm in the people about the Padma Purskara.
In such a situation those people who act in absolutely neutral ways , they and their work should be respected , we feel as if they are not .
Many people are making positive changes in the life of people in different ways by taking excessive labor .
The people who are working freely in public service , social service and among the largest national service , they are karmayi .
Besides the actual activity , they are far away from the misery of the glittering glimpse of fame .
He believes in work . Yoga : This message of the past of Karmasu Kaushalam is one way visible .
I want to talk to myself about some such people today .
Khatri is working to reach the new generation of rare paintings .
This art work made by Abdul Ghafur was given to the Maji President Barack Obama of America .
Among the standards of Padma Purskaras Shabbir Sayid Gomata of Maratha is known as the servant .
Seeing the way they are offering for the service of the whole life , their works are seen to be different .
Even after a hundred years of age , many of those two people are giving training of yoga .
Till now he has made one and a half thousand people ' yoga teacher ' , Jamuna Tudu , famous by the name of Lady Tarzhan in Jharkhand , worked hard to do two hand with timber mafia and nakalvads , not only this , but also to save 50 hectares of jungles from getting destroyed .
Because of the hard work of Jamunabaiji , the villagers of that part now plant 18 trees after the birth of every child in their house .
They have worked towards the way women can prove beneficial in energies and fields .
How is Chachi inspired to become financially self-sufficient by connecting 300 women in their part with self-help group .
This change in the list of award winners i . . the new statue of Hindustan being converted in a way can be said .
My beloved countrymen , the feeling of having a heart just came to me recently that you will tell us here today .
Today wherever I go in the country , there is my attempt to meet some beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana -LRB- PM JAY -RRB- i . . Prime Minister Jan Swat Yojna , I have the opportunity to speak to them .
Brothers and sisters , in the last five months about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this program .
Because of this plan a lot of changes are coming in the life of the poor , but I have been kept in mind .
If a poor person is not able to get pacific medical treatment then you must give him information about this program .
This plan is for such poor people .
The season of tests in my favorite countrymen , schools is going to start now .
In taking out different testing boards across the country the tests of these tenth and twelfth will start in the next few weeks .
Teena - the teachers of all the students and all the teachers have a heartbeat with me .
A few days back in Delhi ' Pariksha Pe Church ' used to be organised in such a very big program . Town Hall ' used to keep the same form as the program .
The special meaning of this program ' Pariksha Pe Church ' has been very charming translation on various subjects related to examination this time .
With this the students will become certainly beneficial , such pellets have come into the discussion at this time .
All students , their teachers , their parents can see the complete recording of the U-Tube or program . For the adventurous test my all the presiding warriors ' very interested .
My dear countrymen , there is a discussion about India and there is no discussion about the festival and festival , it can not be done .
This is the reason why there is a tradition of thousands of years old culture , tradition that we have benefited .
I had gone to Kashi a few days back , my dear countrymen , I got a chance to spend some time with Divyang brothers and sisters in this meeting of Kashi .
And would it be a pleasant surprise to listen to Nawal , for me .
The way I speak in the words of that Divyang youth , I will show you just by narrating the same way .
I love a lot . This means that people just hear and leave the words of the mind , not .
I really got very impressed with the strength of that Divyaang young man .
My dear countrymen , joining all ourselves through this program of ' Mother Ki Baat ' is an abusive experience for me .
Through radio I communicate with the Kotyavani families in a way every month .
Many times while talking to all of us , while reading the utensils sent us or while listening to the thoughts we have expressed on the phone , it seems as if all of us have considered me a member of our family .
This thing is extremely pleasant experience for me .
Mitrano , selecting is the biggest festival of Lokshahi .
In the coming two months we are busy in the humidity of all the people selecting .
I am also in this selective way .
After respecting the strong democratic tradition it will be the last Sunday of the month in the mother-in-law of the mind .
That is , in the month of March , in the month of April and in the whole three such months are going .
After selecting all the feelings of this period with a new belief , along with this on the strength of the blessings of all of us the program of condolences with us is being started once again through the ' Mon Ki Baat ' and has been living with us for many years .
Once again gives us all a lot of blessings from the heart .
Manki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service .
Lord Basveshwar has learned to us . Kayakve Kailash meaning doing hard work keep following his responsibility i . . the residence of Lord Shivaji is like staying in Kailash Dham .
His fame was such a scholar who had a unique distinction on English , Sanskrit and Kannada languages .
He was a social reformer.
They will get food , shelter , education and spiritual knowledge for the entire life , for this it would continue .
Many times it is beneficial for me to receive the blessings of the Lord Swamiji .
In 2007 , for the birth centenary year of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji his Maji President Dr . .
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem at this time for the worshippers .
This poem of En Giving , You Receive Happiness All Mitty with Blass , All Your Actions ' Dr . Kalam Saheb shows the life of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Monastery beautifully .
Once again , I offer such great men my faithfully .
There is a very important institution in our country which is an individual part of our democracy and is older than our citizen - I am speaking about Indian election campaign .
On 25th January the election program was established , which is celebrated as National Matadar Dina National Voters Day , seeing the huge selective events in India , it seems astonishing to the people of the world and it is natural for every country to feel respectful about the election campaign .
Every citizen of India in our country , which is a registered person .
Registered is maternal , he will get a chance to pay attention , he does not leave any stone unturned to eat it .
In Himachal Pradesh even at a height of 15 , 000 feet from the sea level the center of death starts , we hear this , but on extremely remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands are also arranged .
Imagine, just for a mattress.
When this thing is heard then it is natural to expression towards selection .
Keeping in mind that he should get the opportunity to use his master , for this the employees of the election commission go to the far-flung areas and arrange maternal grandeur , this is the beauty of our people .
I admire the choice of continuous attempts to strengthen my folklore .
I told the young lady , if she is unable to donate , then she must register as a maternal grandmother .
At the same time , supreme rays are my duty - also the feeling should be felt in itself .
We have to feel this responsibility .
This should become our attitude , our attitude .
This should be our culture .
I insist on the ignorant person in the country , we will all be able to get a definite record together , or people will die , for this make people aware by running a mohim .
I hope that young people will be registered in large quantity and will make their democracy stronger with their participation .
My dear countrymen , on this great land of India many great men have been given birth and those great men have made some unique and unforgettable tasks for humanity .
Our country is multipurpose .
One of these great men was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose .
On 23 January the whole country celebrated their Jayanti in a different way .
On the day of Netaji ' s jyanti the dedicated museum to the heroes who contribute in India 's freedom struggle give me luck .
We know that in the Red Fort many rooms , buildings were closed from freedom till date .
The closing rooms of the Red Fort are now in a very beautiful museum , dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Indian National Army .
The museum dedicated to Yad-e-Jaliyan and 1857 Atin Fuffty Consumption , India 's First War of Independence and this entire campus has been dedicated to the country in the form of a revolutionary temple .
In each of these museums , there is aroma of our glorious history .
Thai Thai Thai in the museum inspires us to see the stories of the gallantry of our freedom struggle , watching us in history .
At this very place British royalties were run on Bharat Mata 's Veer Suputra - Colonel Prem Sahagal , Colonel Gurubaksingh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan .
When I went to the Red Fort , the memories associated with Netaji in the Kranti temple , the members of Netaji 's family gave me a very special , cap cap cap cap .
Netaji used to wear that cap .
I allowed to keep that hat in the museum so that the people coming there should see that hat and take inspiration from it .
Actually it is necessary to continuously reach different forms of our innovation , beauty and countrywide till the new generation .
A month ago I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December .
In a program, the tricolor was blown at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose had broken the tricolor 75 years ago.
This is why when the tricolor was broken in the Red Fort in October of 2018 then it would surprise everyone because there is a tradition of 15 August here .
This proposed agreement was completed 75 years after the establishment of the Indian Government .
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a heroic jewel and efficient association .
A such heroic jewel in which played an important role in the struggle of freedom .
Come to Delhi , let me eat , I will give you permission , by making such a multitude of exciting declaration the Netaji will get a place in the minds of every Indian .
For many years there was such a demand for bringing the files related to Netaji to everyone and I am happy that we can do this work .
I had come to the family headquarters of NATAGENCHER , then I remember the day .
We all gathered together on many biography related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhash Bose .
I am happy to have attempts to develop many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi .
Then whether it is 26 , Alipur road related to Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel museum or Kranti temple .
If we come to Delhi then definitely see these places .
My dear countrymen , today when we talk about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and that is the mother of the mind , then I want to tell us a story related to the life of Netaji .
I have always considered as an important medium of joining the radio people , similarly the Netarians also used to be very close to the radio and they also chose the radio to join the people of the country .
In 1942 , Subhash Babu started the Hindi radio and through the radio Ajhad Hindu used to communicate with the soldiers and people .
There was a different way of starting the language of Subhash Babu on the radio .
They used to say before initiating the language - Dhis Is Subash Chandra Bose Speaking to Over the Over the Hindi Radio and listening to this as if a new zodiac , a new energy was transmitted .
I am unable to say that this radio station used to disseminate the weekend , which was given in many languages like English , Hindi , Tamil , Bengali , Marathas , Punjabi , West and Urdu .
In order to run this radio station Gujarati resident M.
Vyas played an extremely important role .
The programs being exhibited from the Azad Hind radio were very popular among the common people and from their program the warriors of our freedom struggle got a lot of strength .
In this cranti temple a painting museum has been built .
There has been an attempt to present Indian art and culture in extremely attractive ways .
There are four historical demonstrations in the museum and there are many centuries old paintings and art works .
The excellent art workforce of great artists like Amrita Shergil , Raja Ravi Varma , Avanendra Nath Tagore , Gaganendra Nath Tagore , Nandlal Bose , Jamini Rai , Saloz Mukherjee are in the museum .
And I did all of us a special aim , we must go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
Now we think the church of art is initiated here and I am telling you about seeing the best art works of Gurudev Tagore .
Till now we are regarding Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician .
But I want to say that Gurudev was also a painter .
On many subjects they have made paintings .
They have also drawn pictures of animals and birds , they have also taken many beautiful natural pictures and not only this they have worked on many human characters through art .
And the special thing is that they will not give any name to most of our pictures .
It was believed that those who watch their paintings themselves understand the meaning of those paintings , they will know the meaning of the message given by them from their point of view .
Their paintings have also been performed in European countries , Russia and America .
We must see their paintings in Kranti temple , I hope that .
My dear countrymen , India is the land of saints .
Our saints have given the message of harmony , equality and social harmony through their thoughts and work .
Santa Rabidasji used to give a big message to the elderly only from a little hole .
He used to say . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He used to say , if God is in reality in every person then it is not right to wait for him , pandh and other socially .
Guru Ravidasji was born on the holy land of Varanasi .
Santa Rabidasji tried to tell by explaining the importance of labour and restraint throughout the life through his messages .
It would not be wrong to say here that they told the world the true meaning of the talent of patience .
My beloved countrymen , Kiran Siddar has written on my mother govt that I should put light on the international program of India and its future related aspects .
I wish to take students juice in the interior program and considering something different , they have expressed such desire to go ahead from the sky . Kiranji , I love this idea of myself and this message given specially to my children .
A few days back , I was in Ahmedabad when I was lucky to ignore the effigy of Dr . Vikram Sarabhai .
Dr . Vikram Sarabhai has remained an important contribution in the international program of India .
In our international program innumerable youth scientists of the country have a contribution .
Today our students have reached satellites and sounding rockets developed in the interior , we are aware of this .
This is the Kalam-Set Launch Kel made by our students on 24 January .
In Orissa sounding rockets made by the students of Vidyapeeth have been established many Vikrams .
As far as the country has become independent till 2014 , as far as the international moments have started in the last four years .
We have also made worldwide sale of 1004 sub-divisions from one international point of view .
We will soon show the presence of India on the moon through Chandrayan-2 Mohammad .
Our country is using international technology with the best way to protect lives and wealth .
Whether it is a chakraism , rail and road safety , in all these there is a good help of interior mechanism .
Our mosquito builders have been given navigative devices , which are also helpful in economic growth along with their safety .
We are using interior mechanism for distributing government services and increasing responsibility .
In this program of houses for all i . . houses around 40 lakh houses have been tied up in 23 states .
At the same time , under MNREGA about three and a half crore merchants are also living tag calendars .
Our satellites today have become resistant to the growing strength of the country .
Our best relations with many countries of the world are the same contribution .
South Asia Satleits has remained a unique example , due to which the neighbouring Mitra nations have also been given the gift of development .
Through our last racial lunch service India is launching not only the developing country but also the satellites of developed countries .
For children sky and stars are always a big attraction .
Our interior program gives the opportunity to go ahead even the limits which the children think separately .
Our children are our point of view to discover and inspire new stars along with staying in the stars .
My beloved countrymen , I always tell that the player will open and many youths and youth players have come out openly in India .
In the month of January about 6,000 players participated in 18 players in the Khelo Indian youth Creda competition .
When the local player will perform the best , then only he will perform the best in the world .
This time players of every state in India have done a good job at their own level .
Many players simultaneously simultaneously inspire the life forcefully .
He lives in a parking shelter with his family .
The captain of the 21-year-old woman Kabdi Sangh of Maharashtra is a resident of Sonali Healthy Satara . Very little girl went to her boy and her brother and her brother would encourage the queen of gold .
Often it is seen that in playing like jaggery the girls do not get encouragement .
Still , Sonalina chose Kabdi and performed the best .
The ten year old innovative Shaw of Asansol is the gold medal winner of the youngest age in the Khelo Indian youth .
Akshay Baswani , daughter of a farmer in Karnataka , is a gold medal jewel in Kamti Hin Wettlefting .
Their elders are fielders in Belgaum .
When we talk about the construction of India then the composition of youth power is new India .
Not only does the contribution of big cities in the construction of New India - New India but youths coming from small towns , villages , villages , youths , youths , youths , youth sporting talents , this is also a big contribution , this is the same story of Khello India .
My dear countrymen , we must have heard of many prestigious beauty contents .
The name of this inflammatory spring is clean beautiful toilet .
People along with keeping their toilet clean , making some paintings beautiful , we will also get to see how many pictures of clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup .
I invoke all the Sarpanch and the village chiefs to do the leadership of this moment in my Panchayat .
Definitely put your clean beautiful photo on Mylzatghar co-social media .
Mitrano , on 2 October , 214 everyday we started such a journey together to keep in mind all together to free the country from clean and open toilets .
Today the co-operations of each of the people of India are moving towards getting free from open defecation very long before October 2 , 2001 so that the fathers can offer respect to their 150 years of age Jayanti .
The resident of Himachal Pradesh Angul Sharma has written on My Gov , that I should speak about test and test warriors .
Angul ji, wealthy about presenting this issue.
For many tests the first part of the year is the example of tests .
Students from their parents to teachers are busy in the work related to all the people 's examinations .
I wish all students , their parents and teachers .
I would definitely like the churches in this program of ' Mother Ki Baat ' on this subject today , but we would be happy to hear that after two days on 29th January , at 11 in the morning at ' Pariksha Pe Church ' program the students from all over the country are invited to participate in this program along with the students .
And this time many foreign students will also participate in this program .
In some of these I will definitely keep in mind in the program between the thoughts and information town hall .
Through Soshal Media and Namo Pa we can also see the same live transmission .
My beloved countrymen , 30 January is the virtue of worshipping fathers .
At 11 o'clock the whole country offers homage to the hunters .
We also offer homage homage for two minutes .
My guys are very fond of all of us, very blessed.
The year 20018 ends .
And then experiences benefit and self confidence also arises to choose .
What can we do , with which our life can be changed , along with this the contribution made by the society and the country forward .
We all have many spectacles of 219 .
To keep any memories of 2018 with you all will be determined .
This is also important that in the year 2018 India will be remembered as a country , in the form of strength of its one hundred and thirty crore people .
And all of us are also going to be filled with pride .
In 2001 AD the world 's largest adult India ' started the inauguration of this health vima program .
Vegetables reached every treasure of the country .
The renowned institutions of the world believe that India is working fast for poor eradication .
The spread of cleanliness with the immense imagination of the countrymen is progressing towards the progress of 95  ahead .
After independence on the 75th day of the establishment of the Azad Hind government the Tricolor was broken on the Red Fort .
The country got the highest statue of unity in the world for the honor of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
The name of the country has been raised in the world .
The best environmental architecture of the United Nations has been given to the country .
The efforts of India done for change in sun energy and environment will get place in the world .
The first batch of ' Jagatik Saur Aghadi ' took place in India .
Due to our collective efforts there has been an unprecedented increase in the sequence of India 's trade simplicity .
The conservation of the country became stronger .
This year our country successfully completed the Lavik Trikona i . . now we have decorated the atmosphere in these areas of Lashkar , Naudal and Airways .
The wells of the country roamed the world through ocean indirectly and the horn of the country was filled with respect .
India 's first climate was started in Varanasi .
Due to this revolution has started in the waterway area .
The longest rail route of the country was inaugurated , the first and the country of Sikkim was inaugurated by the 100th Pakiyong airport .
Within 19 years the world class , blind cricket worldwide thinker of cricket has also been included in India .
This year India earned a large number of medals in Asian creed competitions .
In Para Asian competition also India has done good work .
If I keep speaking about my collective efforts for the men of every Indian then my mother ' s daughter will be so long that 2019 will glitter .
All this is possible only by the untiring efforts of 130 crore countrymen .
My dear countrymen , in this December we have compared some unusual Indians .
On 19th December in Chennai Dr . Jaychandran got the same fund .
Doctor Jahandran is considered to be the cheapest therapist .
People say that they used to be ready for the service of the patient .
I have read many legends about such activity inspiring their society at this point of view .
Similarly , on 25th December Sulagittinersamma of Karnataka got funded .
In the beginning of this year he was honored with ' Padmasri ' .
There are many persons like Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narsaman who have dedicated their life to the good of society .
If we are talking about health care , then I would like to fight against the social efforts started by the doctors of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh .
Recently some workers of our bird told me that by organizing some youth doctors camps in the city give free treatment to poor patients .
In these camps there is facility of free treatment on many diseases every month of heart lung critical care .
Today hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps every month .
The enthusiasm of these young doctors doing patients with unconsciousness is really arbitrary .
Today I feel convinced to say that the entire India campaign is successful only because of mutual efforts .
Some people told me , some days ago in Jabalpur of Madhya Pradesh more than three lakh people were cleaned Mohim Rabvili .
I'm right now thebeterindia.
I am concerned that most people will get information about our maidens who bring about changes in society .
It is easy to spread negativeness .
But many good works are being done around us in society .
And all this happens with the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians .
In every society playing is an important thing .
When games are played then energy is also produced in the mind of those who see them .
We see many things like fame , identity , honor of players .
But in many cases there are many such things which are more than the world , bigger .
I will tell you about the Kanya Hanya Nisar of Kashmir now , they have jinned gold medals in the karta competition that took place in Korea .
Hanya is 12 years old and stays here in Anantnag of Kashmir .
Hanaya studied and practiced the harvest by Mehnat and Chikati , learned to make a difference in it and proved himself .
I pray for the bright future of all the countrymen .
Many beauty and blessings of Hanya .
Similarly 16 year old Rajini has been very popular among the mediums of this girl .
Rajni told that to reach here his parents have done a lot of hard work .
Jasmer Singh used to go out on work every morning before Rajni and his feelings got up .
When Rajjan expressed his desire to learn competition then the father collected all that means and increased his enthusiasm .
Rajini had to use old gloves for the sake of foolishness because his family had a financial situation .
Despite all these obstacles , Rajni did not swallow up and remained a foolish learner .
He has also won a medal in Serbia .
I give luxury and blessing to Rajini and enjoy his parents Jasmer Singhji and Usha Rani to help Rajini and to increase his enthusiasm .
In the same month a 200 year old well of Pune , Vedangi Kulkarni has become the fastest Asian cycling worldwide .
It used to run around 300 kilometres daily for 159 days .
You imagine 300 kilometers of cycling every day
Their responsibility of making a cycle is really arbitrary .
We get inspiration by listening to such success , doing this work .
Especially when my young friends listen to some incidents then they also get inspiration to show something by crossing the obstacle .
If it is determined , there is strength in the composition then all the problems are swallowed automatically .
No problem can become obstruction .
When we hear about such examples then we also get inspiration every moment of life .
Many times like luxury and joy in my beloved countrymen , January , Pongal , Makar Sankranti , Uttaranam , Magh Bihu , Maghhi are coming .
The color of traditional dances will be seen somewhere in Sanoran country with the permission of all these festivals , then somewhere in the joy of swing iron will be burnt .
After this the day starts increasing gradually and the season of winter season starts .
Many accomplishments of our food habits are also for our food habits .
Oneness in our variety - one India 's best India is included in its values .
We can see how many accomplishments of our festivals have occurred with nature .
In Indian culture the society and nature are not different here , there is only a person and accomplishment .
The best example of our close relationship with nature is - calendar based on cells .
In this the number of years is not only , but also the knowledge of the planets - boats .
From these traditional calendars it is known how old our relationship is with natural and astronomical events .
According to the speed of the moon and the sun the number of categories is fixed according to the moon and the sun calendar .
This depends on the calendar which counts on the calendar .
In many parts snakes are also celebrated according to the situation of the devotees .
All of these are celebrated according to the moon calendar , whereas Tamil Putandu , Vishnu , Vaishak , Baisakhi , Poila Baisak , Bihu - all these are celebrated according to the sun calendar .
River and water harvesting has special significance in many of our qualities .
Sixth is a source of sun worship in rivers , lakes .
Millions of crore people also take bath in the holy rivers of Makar Sankranti .
Our children also teach us social girls .
On one side it has an archaeological importance , on the other hand every one goes easily through the inspiration of social harmony .
I give us all a lot of beauty of 219 and the future expresses such desire to give us a lot of joy .
My beloved countrymen , there are many things in our culture which we can imagine and show all the world honestly and one of these things is our Kumbh .
People from the country and abroad come there and join the Kumbh fair forever .
In Kumbh the population of faith and faith is broken .
In one place , many people from the country and abroad have come together .
The tradition of Kumbh Mela is shaped and reflected in its great cultural heritage .
This year from 15 January to Prayagraj is organising world famous Kumbh festival , which perhaps you are waiting for everyone .
For the Kumbh fair since now the saints and grandsons have started reaching Prayagraj .
Last year UNESCO has placed Kumbh in the list of unique cultural traditions of humanity , from which we can imagine its world importance .
A few days back the princes of many countries had come to see the preparation of Kumbh Mela .
At that time the national flag of many countries was hoisted there at the same time .
In this Kumbh organized in Prayagraj there is a possibility of more than 150 people coming to the country .
The grandeur of India from the auspiciousness of Kumbh will glitter its variety of species throughout the world .
The Kumbh festival is an effective medium of its own research and every person coming here has a different feeling .
Especially for young people this is a very big educational experience .
I had gone to Prayagraj a few days back . I saw there the preparation of Kumbh Mela was started very fast .
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh Mela .
This year cleanliness is also being filled in the Kumbh festival .
If you will take care of cleanliness along with cleanliness in the event of Kumbh then its good message will reach far .
This year after the sacred bath in the Bhavani Triveni Sangam one can also visit Akshayavat 's Punishment .
This Akshayvat , a symbol of faith of the emotions , had been closed in a fort for many years , due to which even after wishes the emotional sight could not be seen .
Only now the darshans of this fort of Akshayavat have been opened for everyone .
I would prefer to you when you wake up the Kumbh Mela , then definitely upload some photos showing different colors and colors of Kumbh Mela on social media , seeing that photo more people will get the inspiration to go to this Kumbh .
This Kumbh of spirituality became the great Kumbh of philosophy for Indians .
This Kumbh of artisticity, also become the great Kumbh of creation powers.
My beloved countrymen , there is a lot of excitement in the minds of all our countrymen regarding the program of the Ganarajya Din of 26 January .
There is a unique stream between the worshipped Bapu and South Africa .
From South Africa itself ' Mohn ' has become ' Mahatma ' .
In South Africa itself Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and remained firmly opposed to description .
He also established Finiks and Tolstoy Forums from where voices have been raised for peace and justice all over the world .
In the year of 2018 Nelson Mande is also celebrated as a tribal year , which is also known by the name of ' Madiba ' .
Nelson Mandela , this is considered an ideal of the struggle of variety in the whole world , which is deliberate to all of us .
He got the ability and inspiration to swallow up the turangwas for so many years from the respectable father .
They considered the fathers as their ideals .
Both fathers and mandela not only inspiration for the whole world but their ideals always encourage us to create a society full of love and grace .
My beloved Deshbandhano , a few days back in Gujarat on the Narmada shore , there was a DGP discussion here , where the world 's highest effigy i . . Statue of University ' .
How many steps are being taken to ensure the safety of the country and the country , it has been discussed in detail .
At the same time I announced the start of Sardar Patel award for national unity and in any way the persons who donate contribution to national unity will be honored or awarded .
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country .
He has always been trying to keep the integrity of India infinite .
In the diversity here only the true strength of India is united , such a Sardar would have been considered to be Patel .
Honouring their feeling , through this architecture of unity I am offering them devotional gifts .
My beloved Deshbandhano , on 13 January this is the holy day of Guru Gobind Singh Ji 's Jayanti .
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born here in Patna , for a long time North India was his activity and he lived in Nanded in Maharashtra .
Birthday Patna , Karmabhoomi north India and in Akher Nanded of life .
This way in one sense the whole of India got their blessings .
If we look at their life then the reflection of the entire India can be seen in it .
After the martyrdom of Pitta Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji Guru Gobind Singh ji got the post of Guru in nine years of age .
Guru Govind Singhji got the courage to fight for justice in the form of war from Guru .
His personality becomes calm and simple only when efforts were made to smile poor and weak , when the injustice occurred on them , Guru Gobind Singh gave a strong fight to the poor and weak and so it is said ..
From one and a half lakh boys , birds , so Manjung Turaun , then Gobind Singh Nam Kahuan used to say that fighting against weakness is not appropriate to exhibit our strength .
Mr . Guru Gobind Singh believed that this is the biggest service to remove the misery of humans .
It is an excellent trident , along with gurumukhi , Sanskrit , Farshi , Hindi and Urdu they have their mastery in many other languages .
I once again devote Shri Guru Gobind Singh .
My beloved countrymen , there are many good things in the country which are not discussed in a wider way .
I i . . Indian food habits and standard executions are being run .
I have started working to encourage the safe and healthy habits of diet .
When India is clean , healthy then only India can be prosperous .
Nutritious food is the most important thing for good health .
In the same context, F.S.
I enjoy their hearts in relation to this activity taken by hands .
We all want to participate in this program , such a glory I want to do to us .
We also participate in this and especially the children show this thing , I want to tell you .
It is important to get the important education of diet from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen , this is the last program of this year of 2018 , we will meet again in the year 2019 .
Life , whether it is of the person , of the nation or of the society , inspiration is the step of the progress of that life .
Such new inspiration , new zeal , new composition , new principle and new height , let us move forward , change yourself and change the country also .
On the sacred mouth of Vijayadashmi on 31 October , 214 day we all started a journey together through ' Man Ki Baat ' .
One person i . . he was a dressman .
Nothing like cloth for adult on the drain.
On the sides of the road they had made a tiny turtle like a turtle .
At that time the discussion started on the radio itself .
In the extremely remote part of the country , from the entire village to Metro cities , from farm buildings to youth businessmen , it should be reached to all .
Recently a survey has also been done by the sky ventilator about ' Mon Ki Baat ' .
I have seen the effects received from that survey , some effects are completely different , careful .
Among those people in whom this survey has been done , mostly 70 percent of them are those who listen to the words of the mind regularly .
In order to increase positive feelings in most people there is a very big contribution of mind , it seems impossible .
This is a glimpse of positive feeling in the minds of our countrymen .
Many people have also discovered their experiences that because of the mother ' s mother ' i . . voluntarium ' i . . voluntary , voluntary actions have increased .
People are now very excited , coming forward for social service , such changes have come up .
I am very happy to see the radio growing popularity now because of the mother of the mind .
But in this journey only radio is no longer a single medium .
Thank you very much about phone calling
The doubt that we have presented is absolutely fine .
After all if a leader has been given a mike to speak and if he loves millions of people to listen to him then what else is it
Which word was used again and again , it was practiced .
By doing this exercise the chiefs have concluded that this program is not related to Rajkanan , at the same time I started the ' Baat of Man ' program , at the same time I decided that do not rule in this , do not read the government ' s reading in it , then do not get any foolishness in it .
I got all this inspiration from you , Kelant , Tum , the most important thing to do with my composition .
It becomes clear in the leafs of every part of the mind , in the online tips , what are the names of the streams from the coming out of the telescope .
What will come and go , but this country is going to be dark , our culture is immortal .
These small things of 130 crore people of the country are constantly alive .
Somebody writes a letter from a far off places of the country and tells me that people do not feel too foolish with small shopkeepers like us , auto-rickshaw drivers , friends , vegetable sellers .
Now like Selfie Vith Doter , the mohim starts in a small village of Haryana state and spreads not only in the whole country but also abroad .
The mother-in-law is not a government member .
This ' Mon Ki Baat ' is an experimental Indian i . . an ambitious thing of India .
If we give a direct answer to the question which we have considered in a very simple word then tell you - we do not make any preparation .
Actually ' mother of mind ' is a very easy task for me .
Because every time before the mother-in-law of the mind , my shoes come from the people .
By calling this number people also record their message in their voices .
Before every part of the mother of the mind most of the leaf and penis are my attempts to save ourselves .
Every moment my countrymen , have kept home in my mind and at the same time whenever I read a portrayal , then the situation of that player , in his mind , becomes part of my thoughts .
In such a situation that leaf is not just a piece of paper .
Well if we talk then this voice is mine in the mother-in-law but all examples , feelings and inspiration are of my countrymen only .
There are lakhs of people whom I can not call in the mother of the mind till date , but these people are not narrow , send their secretaries .
An attempt is also made to give attention to all the patriarchs and related departments which are unable to get place in the skull of the mind .
Because of their hard work only one can reach the maximum number of people .
A team of Akashwani prepares each part to spread in different languages .
Some people listen to the words of monkeys in the regional languages spoken in the same style .
In one way they become nervous mood for 30 minutes .
I enjoy them and give them blessings for their humorousness and their decorations showing them .
We all must listen to this program in our local language as well , this is my leadership to all ours .
But many of the subjects which were discussed in the ' Mon Ki Baat ' have also been lifted up through media .
There are many topics like cleanliness , road safety , innumerable things free India , selfie with doctor , on those topics making a new plan through media gave it the form of a campaign and did a lot of work in that area .
Without its co-operation the journey of ' Man Ki Baat ' tea remained incomplete .
Sometimes even our ancestor stands like a very big crisis in translation .
Besides acceptance and reaction I give priority to understand what the person of the front say .
Generally there is always a discussion about the ' Communication Gap ' situated between family big , old mandali and Kumar Vayotali girls .
In fact in most of the houses the subjects of talking to young children and children are also limited .
In this there were discussions about the study of children or their habits as much as their intestines as possible .
Whatever they are doing or how these girls think , can they learn from them fast , new things , for this I always stay stressful .
This is the only India .
Some people have to say that young girls have the desire to do many things at the same time .
I say - what is bad in this .
These youths have shown the patience of questioning and watching the great dreams , the same youths have made this change .
From here my beloved countrymen , Gurugram , Vinita ji has written on ' Mayagava ' that ' Man Ki Baat ' i . . on 26th November , I should speak about ' Yana Point ' i . . ' Rajghatna Din ' .
They have to say that this day is very special because we accepted the state committee which is now going to enter the year of 69 years , despite being 69 years .
Understand that in three years this great geography has created such a comprehensive and detailed event .
The way these great people have made such a fast deterioration , this work is an excellent example of the management and productivity of the world even today .
The special thing in our state is that the authority and duties i . . Rhites and Duties have been described fully extensively .
In the life of the citizens both of these are going forward to the country .
If we respect , respect for the rights of other parties then our rights are to be protected automatically and even if we follow our duties given in the state , our rights are to be protected automatically .
The citizen of India had been 60 years old , at that time in 2001 we had taken a grand luxury journey keeping an elephant on the elephant in Gujarat , this is even more than a quarter of me .
In order to create awareness about the state demolition in the youth and to know them the important aspects of the state demolition , the attempts made by us to connect them with the state demography proved to be memorable .
And in our country make sure that Peace , Progress , Prosperity i . . calmness , progressive prosperity Nandel .
At the time when my beloved countrymen , the state committee is discussed , at that time we can never forget the contribution of the great man .
It was a great man, a serpent.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
On 6th December is their great festival day .
What is the customer and what is the system , this is not a new thing for India .
He had said , this freedom we got after such a union is invaluable , that is why we have to protect our blood from the drops of the blood .
India First Dr.
My dear countrymen , two days before , on 23 November we all celebrated Shri Gurunak Devji and in the next year i . . in 2019 we are celebrating her 550th light festival .
Gurunak Devji always considered the welfare of the entire humanity .
He always showed the society the path of truth , action , service , compassion and goodness .
All state governments and centrally ruled states have also been instructed to celebrate this program in large quantity .
This way the 350th light of Gurunak Dev ji will be celebrated in all the countries worldwide .
At that time I remember Lakhpat Sahib Guruvdar .
In Gujarat during the earthquake in 2001 this guruvada had suffered a lot of loss .
But with the help of local people the way the state government has done this guerrilla renovation is still a model .
The Government of India has taken an important decision to make Kartarpur corridor because of which travellers in our country can easily see that holy place of Gurunaak Devi in Kartarpur through Pakistan .
But this journey of yours is like this .
The more people connected with us , their journey is better and enjoying everyone .
Sometimes there is a question in the mind of people , what do I get because of the mother of the mind
Manki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October is the celebration of all our lords Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and every year like this the youth group of the country has been able to run for hearing ' Rain For University ' .
For listening to all of us in large numbers definitely take part in this running plan , this is my aim .
About six months before independence , on 27 January 1947 , the famous international month 'Time ' was published in the world , the photographs were printed on his skull .
This was the map of India which had been divided into many parts .
Then more than 50 institutions were in the country .
Even though the juice of the British of India had been finished , he would then leave the country by breaking it in many parts .
The ' Time ' menstruations were written that there are dangers like fleeing on India , hindrance , non-violent twisting , expense and royalty .
Thirdly we wrote the ' Time ' menstruation , in all of these if the ability to sink the country in the threshold of hearing and to fill the wounds then they are the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
This description of ' tim month ' used to open many other parts of the life of the iron man .
After coming to Ahmedabad in the decade of 1920 how he arranged the rescue work , how he gave Bardoli Satyagraha the direction .
They will bring all the institutions merger in India .
Whether it is Junagarh , Hyderabad , Travancore that due to the ideological maturity and synonymous culture of the royal family of Rajasthan we can see India together today .
Seeing this nation built in the bond of hearing , we naturally remind of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
The Jayanti of Sardar Patel celebrated on 31st October of Yand will be even more special - on that day we dedicate the effigy of listening to Sardar Patel to the Statue of University .
The height of this statue built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double than the height of the Statue of Liberty Puppet in America .
This effigy is the highest square effigy of the world .
Every Indian will now realize that the world 's highest effigy is on the Indian territory .
Sardar Patel , who was from the earth , will also increase the beauty of the sky .
My beloved brothers and sisters , tomorrow we celebrated all the countrymen infantry day .
This is the same day , on the day Indian soldiers descended on the earth of Kashmir and preserved the skull from the horsemen .
The direct relation of this historical moment is with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
I was reading the great wooden ruler of India Sam Manikshaw in an old childhood .
In that childhood Field Marshall Manikshaw was telling memories of the time of the corneal .
On 31 October is also the death anniversary of our Maji Pantpradhan Shrimati Indira Gandhi .
Honourful devotion to Indiraji.
Doesn ' t my loved countrymen , don ' t you like to play
In the world of sports Spirit , Strength , Skill , Stamina these things are extremely important .
The country whose youths have these qualities will not only propagate in areas like economics , science and technology but also in sports .
Our Para Athletes joined in Asian Para Games in 2018 got a chance to visit .
In this competition India has collected a total of 72 medals and increased the wealth of India .
The fate of all these talented para athletes personally gains me and I congratulated them .
Similarly winners of the Summer Youth Olympics in Argentina got a chance to visit the winners of 2018 .
We would enjoy listening to this , Youth Olympics has done the best work till now in 2018 .
Or we got three more posts in Mix types other than 13 medals.
We remembered that even in the Asian Games of India 's workforce remained excellent .
See , how many times I used the best , most gentle words of this day while speaking for some minutes .
This is a story of Indian sports , which is rotating new height everyday .
India is not only in sports but also in such areas which has never been considered .
For example I want to tell us about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur , he has a gold medal in Athletics for the country in the Asian Para Games of 2018 .
They are Divyang from birth .
When he was eight years old then his elderly warley .
Then eight years out in an orphanage.
After leaving orphanage the driver of life worked as a water in the slopes of DTC bus and roads in Delhi .
Today in the international competitions of Narayan the gold medals are jingling for India .
Not only this , look at the increasing speed of India 's best work in sports , India has never synonymous or geographical medal in Judo .
But Tababi Devi has cherished history by jingling the silver medal in the youth alimbiques .
The youth player of 16 years Tababi Devi is living in a village of Manipur .
If their elders are fond then mother does the work of selling fish .
Many times his family had such time , they did not even have money for food .
Even in such a situation the monastery of Tababi Devi has not come down .
And he struck a medal for the country and made history .
So there are innumerable stories .
Every life is an inspiration source .
Every young player and his responsibility is the identity of the new India .
My favourite countrymen, we'll make a successful event under FIFA 17 years.
The whole world had praised him about taking a very successful campaign .
In case of the number of viewers in the fifta egger sevenantin world cup a new virtue has been registered .
In different stadiums of the country more than 12 lakh people encouraged the joy of football and youth players .
In Bhubaneswar on the year of Yunga the fate of organizing male hockey cup in Bhubaneswar is celebrated .
Hockey World Cup starts in November 2118 and will run till 16 December .
Every Indian is playing any game or playing any game , everybody has a self-esteem in his mind .
The history of India in Hockey has been written by gold .
First India has got gold medals in many competitions and once India has also remained world-speaking winner .
India has also given hockey many great players .
When there is talk of hockey in the world then apart from this great player of India the story of hockey will remain incomplete .
The magnificent Major of Hockey knows Dhyanchand the whole world .
After them from Balwinder Singh Siniyar , Lesli Glodyus , Mohammad Shahid , Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pilla have made a big journey from Hockey .
Even today the players of Tim India are inspiring the new generation of Hockey from the success achieved by their hard work and loyalty .
There is a good opportunity to see a thrilling face for creed lovers .
They should go to Bhubaneswar and encourage not only Indians but also other unions .
During this along with enjoying the sports you can also see the sun temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath temple in the middle of Puri and many world famous visiting places and sacred places along with Chilka lake .
I enjoy the Indian male hockey association for this competition and a hundred crore Indians are standing with them and standing for support .
I also give a lot of pleasure to all the world 's unions in India .
For the kind of people coming forward for my favorite countrymen , social work they are self-serving , they are inspiring and encouraging all the countrymen .
But in the new era , new methods , new generations , new hopes , with new enthusiasm , taking new dreams this work is going forward today .
A few days back I had gone to a program , where a portal has been started , its name is ' Self For Society ' and the country 's IT and electronic industry encouraged our workers to give them such opportunities , this portal has been started .
Every Indian will feel respected to see the enthusiasm and self-sufficiency in them for this work .
IT that society , I am not , we are not , yes , we are in the aroma of the journey of satisfaction .
If the well is learning children then the well is learning the best citizens , the well is engaged in the work of cleaning then the well helps the farmers and there is no desire for doing all this but the selfless feeling of dedication and composition .
A young man learned his own wheelchair basketball to help the wheel chair basketball of the Divangs .
This is the spirit , dedication , this is the venture done for special work .
Does not any Indian realize this
My beloved brethren and sisters , at this time when I was watching the information coming to the people for the mother of the mind , I got to see a charming script of Sri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry .
He has written on Mypov . Please speak on this as the best example of co-operation with nature , the customs and tradition of many species of India in the ' Man Ki Baat ' .
How we need to accept their tradition in our life , how we have to learn something from them .
Manishji , I am doing my duty to keep this subject in mind ' s blessings .
This is such a thing that inspires us to see our glorious history and culture . Today all the world , especially the western countries are discussing environmental protection and are looking for new ways for balanced lifestyle .
Although our India is also not free from this problem but to break it we have to take our intercourse only , our rich history , tradition is worth seeing and especially we have to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities .
Staying in collaboration with nature has remained part of our tribal culture .
Our tribal brothers worship the trees and flowers like goddesses .
People in Bhil tribal communities of central India especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship with the faith of trees like Pimpal and Arjun .
In the desert like Rajasthan the Vishwanatha Samaj has shown us the path of environment conservation .
Especially for the protection of trees it is appropriate to exclude them from their lives but they do not want to harm any tree .
Sweet tigers in Arunachal Pradesh claim to be their own .
They also consider them brother and sister .
In Nagaland tigers are seen as protectors of forests .
In Maharashtra on the occasion of Varanasi people consider tigers as refugees and for them the existence of tigers is like that of bringing prosperity .
It is believed in the coal community of central India that their luck is connected to the tiger , if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will have to stay fast .
In the reproductive season of tribal fish in central India fishing stops in some parts of the Kethan river .
On the Nilagiri Plains in south India a small shrine is broken in the remote part , traditionally their colony is made of things available at local level .
My beloved brothers and sisters , it is true that tribal community fulfils very peaceful and mutually mixing together , but if the well is harming their natural sources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights .
Our first freedom fighters were in the tribal community , there is no surprise in this .
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who has fought strongly against the British government to protect her wild land .
In my favorite countrymen , in the mind we talk about those people and institutions who have done some unparalleled work for society .
Such activity seems to be rare , but in reality their mentality is very deep in changing the direction of society .
A few days back I was reading about the farmer Bhai Gurbachan Singh in Punjab .
The child of a common and troubled farmer Gurbachan Singhji gets married .
Before the marriage Gurbachan ji said that we are doing the marriage of the bridegroom 's mother Vadlana in a simple way .
There are other things above , there is no need to spend more .
We have to celebrate this context in a simple way .
But they suddenly said , but I am a victim .
Nowadays when the topic of married couples comes then generally it seems that some big demand is made in front of them , some such things will be difficult for the bridegroom 's family .
But we will be surprised that this was Bhai Gurbachan Singh as a straight fielder . What they said , what the bridegroom 's father had kept in front is the true strength of our society .
Gurbachan Singhji told him , we will never burn in our fields , give me such a promise .
We can imagine how big social power is there in it .
But this shows how huge their personality is and we have seen that there are many such families in our society which reflect the personal context of social history .
Mr . Gurbachan Singh ' s family has kept such an example in front of us .
I have read another village in Punjab in Kallar Majra which is near the navel .
Kallar Majra is known for this , instead of burning of cereals they mix in mud and those techniques for which they are brought to use .
Happiness of Bhai Gurbachan Singh ji .
To keep the environment clean the enjoyment of the people of all those who are doing the best efforts from us and the people of Kallar Majar .
You are moving ahead like a true heritage of the Indian tradition of strong lifestyle .
The extent to which the ocean is formed by drops and drops , that much smaller activity and awareness and positive activity plays a very big role in creating positive environment .
My beloved countrymen have said in our books . Peace : Interpretation Shanti : Private Shanti : Ap : Shanti : Shanti : Shanti : Shanti : Vishwadeva : Shanti : Brahma Shanti : Shanti : Vishwadeva : Shanti : Vishwadeva : Shanti : Brahma Shanti : Shanti , Shanti : Brahma Shanti , Shanti : Santry , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti : Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti : Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Spirit , Shanti : Shanti , Shanti , Spirit :
In life , in heart , in me , in you , in every part of the world , establish calmness at every place .
Shanti : Shanti : When world peace is discussed then for that the name and contribution of India will be seen shining in the golden shoes .
India has special significance of 11 November because on 11 November the first war of India ended 100 years before today .
That hour is finishing 100 years i . . in that time the huge destruction and the loss of man will be completed for a century .
The first war for India was an important event .
Well if we tell you , then we did not have to give anything directly to that war .
Even then our soldiers fought with pride and played a very big role , gave the best sacrifice .
Indian soldiers showed the world , when war was there then it was not less than Kunan .
Our soldiers have shown deservation in the remote parts , opposite situations .
This was the only purpose for all... reconstruction of peace.
In the first Mahayana the world saw all the destinations .
According to the estimate , nearly one crore soldiers and so many citizens lost their lives .
This will give you peace to the whole world.
The interpretation of peace has changed in the last 100 years .
Today the meaning of peace and harmony is not just war .
From oppression to climate change , economic development to social justice , for all this it is necessary to work with global cooperative and coordination .
The development of poor people is the real symbol of peace .
My dear countrymen , the thing of our north eastern India is something different .
Natural beauty in the northeast is incomparable and the people here are extremely talented .
Our North-East India is known for the best work .
North-East India is such a region which has made a lot of progress in central fields .
A few days back Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award of 2018 for promoting vegetarian food system .
This award is given the details of food and agricultural association -LRB- FAO -RRB- associated with the states .
We will enjoy hearing this that this award given to make the best colony is along with the ocean in that area .
Not only this , our Sikkim enjoyed the people of Sikim by putting 51 numbers of beneficiaries back to this architect .
My dear countrymen , October has ended .
There is a feeling of a huge change in the weather .
There is a lot of humor for all the countrymen or census.
I am awaiting you , take care of yourself in these times , take care of your health and take care of social health also .
This is the chance of taking new decisions .
With this determination one should go ahead in the mission mode , to make a strong plan take a chance in your life .
Your progress is an important heritage of the progress of the country .
The more progress your country will be the better progress .
