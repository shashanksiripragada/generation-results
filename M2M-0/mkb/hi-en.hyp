Therefore, in increasing the festival tourism in India, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important

The effect of Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only in India but in the whole world .
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanakdev ji
I can never forget my visits to the gurus in Vancouver and Tehran
There is a lot about Sri Gurunakdev whom I can share with you, but for this there will be many episodes of mind's talk.

My beloved brothers and sisters, I believe you all will remember the date of October 31
Sardar Patel used to look at things very closely, he used to examine
In fact, they were man of detail
At the same time he was also expert in organization skills .
He had mastered planning and formulating strategies
When they read about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, they know how tremendous his planning was
In 1921, there were thousands of delegates from all over the country to join the Congress session in Ahmedabad in Nineteen Twenty One.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements of the session
This opportunity he used to improve the Network of water supply in the city
They contacted the farmers and urged them to make khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to representatives
Putting shoes in these bags, keeping with you ended the tension of delegates being stolen from their minds.
On the other hand , the sale of khadi increased .
Our country will always be thankful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly
He did important work to ensure fundamental rights, so that there is no scope for any discrimination on the basis of caste and sect
Parents, we all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Home Minister of India, did a great saffron and historic work to unite the states.
Actually, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in some special provinces in the unity of the country.
He also played an important role in small places like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after partition of India in 1947 , our neighbor ' s eye was on Lakshadweep and he sent a ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel got this information, he lost his time without delay, immediately started harsh action
Immediately after their command , the tricolor was hoisted there , and destroyed every neighbour ' s plan to confess the island .
After this incident Sardar Patel told Mudaliar brothers that they personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help to develop
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing importantly to India's progress
This is also an attractive tourist destination
I hope you ' re all going to visit its beautiful islands and sea coasts
My dear countrymen, on the day of October 31, 2018, on the day when Sirdar Saheb was dedicated to the State of Niti Country and the world.
This is the world ' s highest idol
Statue of Liberty situated in America is also double in the height
The world ' s highest statue fills every Hindustani proudly .
Every Hindustani ' s head rises higher than eternal .
You'll be happy in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists arrive to see Statue of Niti
This means that on an average , eight and a half thousand people saw the grandeur of the State of Niti .
The faith that is in his heart towards Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, has appeared, and now there is a factus Garden, Butterley Garden, Jungle Saari, Hildren Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery, the centers of such attractions are continuously developing and this is also promoting the local economy and people are getting new opportunities for employment.
And keeping in mind the convenience of tourists coming, many villagers, in their homes, are providing the facility of Home State.
Processional training is also being given to people providing home status acidities
The people there have now started cultivation of Ragon Riot and I am sure it will soon become the main source of livelihood of the people there .
To colleagues, for the country, for all the states, tourism industry, it may be a subject of a study.
We all testify how a space within a year develops as world famous tourism destination
There people from the country and abroad
Transport, holding, Guides, Deco-rendly arrangements, each other are growing a lot of arrangements themselves.

The government is also playing its role
Parents, as you know, on 31 October every year, national unity day is celebrated from 2014
This day, gives us the message to protect our country at all costs of unity, integrity and security.
On October 31, every time Run for niti is also being organized
It will include every section of society, every section of people
Run for niti is a symbol of this thing, this country is running in one direction and wants to achieve a goal
One goal - one India, the best India I
The last five years have been seen - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the princely states, in the district centers, in small tires-to-tier three cities too, there is a large quantity of men, women, women, people of the city, people of the village, be boys, young, old people, are elderly, everyone is joining in large quantities.

This portal provides information about the places across the country where Run for Nity is to be organized
I hope you'll run all on October 31 - for India's unity, for your own itness
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country in the formula of unity
This mantra of unity is like rites in our life and in the country full of varieties like India, we should keep strengthening this mantra of unity at every stage, at every turn, at every point of time.
Our society has always been very active and alert to empower my loved countrymen, unity of the country and mutual harmony
If we look around us, then there will be many examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual harmony, but many times it happens that the efforts of the society, their contribution, their memory becomes very soon.
Parents, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court pronounced its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi
West Groups were playing to take advantage of those situations in their own way.
To create warmth in the atmosphere, what kind of language was spoken
But all this, five days, seven days, ten days, continued, but, as soon as the decision came, the country felt a pleasant, surprising change
On one hand, everything was done for warmth for two weeks, but when the decision came on Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all the communities, saints and saints gave very balanced and regulated statements
Whenever I remember that day , I am happy to mind .
Respected the dignity of the judiciary very proudly and did not let the atmosphere of warmth, tension anywhere
These things should always be remembered that gives us a lot of strength .
That day, that moment, we all have a duty
This is an example of the voice of unity, the country, how big power gives it
I give them reverence even today
My dear countrymen, today, if a story of the house is heard all away, a story of every village is heard - from north to south, east to west, from every corner of India, a story is heard, then it is cleanliness
But there ' s a pleasant experience and interesting experience
I hear, I think I'll tell you, too.
You imagine, the world's highest budget, where the temperature goes to zero to 50-60 degrees Minus
Hoygen in the air is also the only name
In such a opposite situation, living between such challenges, is not less than any maturity
In such a vicious situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country by breastfeeding, but also running clean Siachen campaigns there.
I appreciate them from the countrymen for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army .
I express thanks .
There ' s so cold that it ' s difficult to have anything decompose
In such a situation, separating and managing garbage, it is a very important task in itself
In such a situation, removing 130 tons of garbage from Glacier and his surrounding area and how big is the service between the ragical eco-system here
We all know that this Siachen is a glacier that is the source of rivers and clean water , so running cleanliness drive means to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower areas .
Also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, festival, we all have a new conscious festival to wake up in life
And in Diwali, especially buying something new, bringing something from the market happens in every family in small quantities.
I once said we try - - buy local things
We don ' t need to go to the tehsil if we get what we need from our village .
If you find in the tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
As much as we try to buy our local things, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in ourselves
And I only urge that our weavers are made with the hand of our khadi volunteers, we must buy something or something.
Even in this Diwali, before Diwali, you must have bought a lot but many people are also such that they think that if you go after Diwali, you may get a little cheaper.
And there will be a lot of people who have bought yet .
So along with Deepawali's best wishes, I will urge you to come and make us urge to buy local things
Look, how important we can play in proveing Mahatma Gandhi's dream
I once again, I wish you a lot of good wishes on the holy festival of this Deepawali
In Diwali we use various types of crackers .
But, sometimes there is a fire in inconvenience.
Somewhere injuries
I urge you all to handle yourself and celebrate the festival with great fanfare .
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Talk of mind, September 2018
Can he control his own life and sustenance
Devotees can remember that Jantarath of Bapu
Can we think of what citizen of my country will benefit from what I am buying
Today the whole country is celebrating the festival of Rakshabandhan
Best wishes to all the people of this holy festival
The festival of Rakshabandhan is considered to be the symbol of love and faith of sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many stories in the history of the country, in which a defense source had linked people associated with two different states or religions with faith.
Just a few days later , the festival of Janmashtami is also coming .
The entire environment is going to elephant, horse, palanquin Jai Kanhaiyalal's, govinda-Govinda's jealousy
The natural joy of swinging in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Besides defence , Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravan Purnima .
I enjoy all those who are engaged in saving, riding and reaching the masses.
Every language has its own significance. India proud of the fact that Tamil language is the world's oldest language and we all proud of the fact that Sanskrit language has played a big role in the publicity of knowledge since Vedic times.
The knowledge related to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technological, agriculture or health, astronomi or architecture, mathematics or management, economist or environment, says that the mind of dealing with challenges of global warming is detailed in our weights.
You will all be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language for talks .
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which the creation of infinite words is possible
Sometimes they use lion-shayari but those who are familiar with Sanskrit auspicious, they know that such accurate statement in very few words is from Sanskrit auspicious and the other is to understand from our land, due to our tradition.
Like it has been asked to explain the importance of the Guru in life - Akshramastu, Guru: Shishya Prabodhayat
We celebrate the next teacher day with all this feeling
His birth celebrates Jayanti as a teacher day .
I wish all the teachers of the country the coming teacher day . Also enjoy your dedication sentiment to science , education and students .
Plants scorching with horrific heat relieve the dry reservoirs, but sometimes it also brings excessive and devastating floods
Nature has become such a situation that in some places there is more rain than other places .
The severe flood in Kerala has badly affected life
Today the whole country stands with Kerala in these difficult circumstances
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their lives, can not be compensated for the loss of life, but I want to convince the condolent families that 100 million Indians are standing with you in this hour of pain.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural disaster should go to health as soon as possible.
I am sure that Kerala will soon rise again on the strength of the people of the state and the indomitable courage .
Everyone from Kachh to Kamrup and Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something at their own level so that wherever there is objection, Kerala or Hindus and districts, people's life can be normal again.
All access groups and people connected to every task field are contributing to
Everyone has been trying to ensure that the trouble of the people of Kerala can be done at least, we shall share their grief
We all know that the armed forces are the heroes of the rescue work in Kerala .
They did not leave any stone unturned to save people trapped in floods
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of NRC jambas .
In this moment of crisis , he has done a very fine job .
NCR ' s ability has become a center of new faith for every Hindustani trying to summon the situation by making their commitment and quick decision .
Tomorrow was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam will give power to the country and especially to Kerala so that they can overcome the disaster as soon as possible and the development journey of Kerala gets more speed.
Once again, I want to convince the people of Kerala from all the countrymen and the other parts of the country where the disaster has come, that the whole country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at suggestions to talk about the mind .
Then the topic on which people from all over the country wrote is the topic of all of us Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, brother Pravin from Kerala, Dr. Swapn Bannerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, how many people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov and have urged me to talk about the various aspects of Atal ji's life.
As soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise on August 16, everyone got drowned in condolence
A nation leader who had left the prime minister 14 years ago
In a way he had gone far away from active politics for the last 10 years .
Were not seen anywhere in the news, publicly not seen
For the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come in front of the country
People have remembered him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular prime minister and do
India will always be thankful of Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act two of us and three
This change made two important changes in India ' s politics .
Firstly , the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 assembly seats .
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-party law was increased from one-third to two-thirds
Along with this, clear guidelines were also set to disqualify the party-changing people.
Political culture of setting up a huge cabinet in India for many years was made not only for the distribution of bigger junk cabinet work but also for enjoying politicians.
Atal ji changed it
This step saved money and resources
At the same time efficiency also increased .
It was a long-standing situation like Atal ji, who changed the situation and developed healthy traditions in our political culture
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure there was a change in the time of presenting the budget .
Earlier , according to the tradition of the British , the budget was presented at 5 in the evening , because at that time it was time to start the Parliament in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time to present the budget from 5 am to 11 am
Many such rules have been made in this code, which has made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
Because of this , more and more Indians got an opportunity to hoist their national flag .
Thus , they brought our life - long tricolor near the people .
Similarly , nowadays you are seeing that discussions about the elections of the Center and the States together in the country are going forward .
People are keeping their point in favor of this subject and both the opposition
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy
I will say that for healthy democracy, develop good traditions for excellent democracy, continuous efforts to strengthen democracy, extend discussions to open mind, this will also be an excellent tribute to Atal ji
Repeating the resolve to fulfill the wealth of their rich and developed India , I pay tribute to Atal ji from all of us .
Just a few days before the monsoon session of Parliament is over
You will be happy to know that the producity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and Rajya Sabha was 74 .
Standing above the party, all MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and the result is that the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and 14 bills
This monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of youth
In this session , many important legislations that benefit the youth and backward communities were passed .
You all knew that for decades there was a way to create B homesision like SST Commission
To ensure the rights of backward classes , the country has fulfilled the resolution to form BCC this time and gave it a constitutional right .
This step will prove to be going forward for the purpose of social justice .
The work of passing the Amendment Bill was also done in this session to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes .
This law will further safeguard the interests of the SC and ST community
At the same time, it will prevent criminals from atrocities and trust in Dalit communities
No civilized society can tolerate any injustice against the country ' s women ' s power .
The culprits of rape are not ready to tolerate the country, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made the most severe punishment.
The culprits of rape will be punished at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls below 12 years of age
A few days ago , you must have read in the newspapers , a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh has sentenced two of the culprits of rape to death after just two months of hearing .
Before this, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh, sentenced the culprits to five days after hearing
Rajasthan has also made such immediate decisions .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crime cases against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
However , this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible . I convince Muslim women that the whole country stands firmly in order to give them justice .
When we go ahead in the country, changes can be brought to the lives of poor, backward, exploited and deprived
In the monsoon session this time everyone has together presented an ideal
These days millions of people are focusing on Asian games happening in Jakarta
Every morning people first in the newspapers, in television, on news, look at social media and see which Indian player has won the medal
Asian games are still running
I want to congratulate all the players who win the medal for the country
Those players also have my best wishes, whose competitions are still left
India's players are especially performing excellent performances in Shooting and restalling, but our players are also bringing medals in those games in which our performance has not been so good before, such as Kushu and Rowing - these are not mere medals - proofs - the sky of Indian sports and players touches thousands and dreams.
Among those who win medals for the country are included in a large number of our daughters and this is a very positive sign - even among the youth players who win the medal are 15-16 years old .
This is also a very good indication that most of the players who have won the medal are living in small towns and villages and these people have earned this success with hard work
On August 29, we will celebrate National Sports Day on this occasion, I wish all the sports lovers, as well as hockey magicians, Mr. Dhyanchand ji, paid my tribute.
I request all citizens of the country to play and take care of their itness because healthy India will build a rich and prosperous India .
Once again , I congratulate medal winners in Asian Games , and I wish to perform well for the rest of the players .
Best wishes to all of the national sports day
Namasta spirit, I respect your feeling
We all have seen houses and epidemics being built with brick stones, but can you imagine that about twelve-seven years ago a huge mountain which was just a single stony mountain, was given the form of an excellent, large and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but that is the temple - the Kailashnath temple located in Allora of Maharashtra.
If someone tells you about a thousand years ago a pillar was built more than 60 metres of granite and around 80 tons of granite was placed on its peak , would you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unbelievable match of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the 11th century queen ' s womb in Patan in Gujarat .
India ' s land engineering laboratory
Many such engineers in India, who made imaginable imaginable and presented examples of miracles in engineering world
We also got a gem in our legacy of great engineers, whose work is still amazing to the people and that was Bharat Ratna Dr. M. Vishwaswarayya (r. M.
In that part of the country, he is worshipped, the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and self-esteem.
their memory is made as igniers Day on 15th September .
Following their footprints , engineers of our country have made their own identity all over the world .
When I talk about the miracles of engineering world, I remember a incident of the terrible earthquake that occurred in Kutch in 2001 today.
At that time I used to work as a volunteer, I got an opportunity to go to a village and there I got an opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years old and he was laughing at me to see me, and he was saying, Look, it's my house - Look at him in Kutch, I say, this house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
But you didn ' t see any harm anywhere .
This house was built by our ancestors according to the nature here, and he was saying this so proudly, then I came to the idea that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had written according to the local conditions that due to which the public was safe.
Now when we celebrate ngineers Day , we should also think for the future
Should workshops at place
In changing age what kind of new things we have to learn
The world is struggling with natural disasters
So what is the new form of structural engineering
What are her courses
What should the students be taught
How did it become our priority
Many such things when igniers celebrate Day , we must think
There is an atmosphere of festivals and along with this the preparations for Diwali start .
Will continue to talk about the mind, talk about the mind and we will continue to gather the country with our minds.
Best wishes to all of you with this feeling
Thank you
We'll meet again
These days there are good news of the rain .
At some places, there is also news of worry due to more rains and at some places people are still waiting for rain
India's diversity, diversity, sometimes shows the form of rain as well as love, but what do we blame the rain, man who chose the path of struggle with nature and it is the result that nature sometimes stops on us.
And that is why we all become our obligation, we become nature lovers, we become the protector of nature, we become the promoter of nature, then the balance in what is in nature ourselves.
In the past, the incident of a natural disaster attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked the human mind
All of you must have seen on TV, 12 teenagers in Thailand went to the cave to roam the football players' team and their coach.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it, all of them
But on that Day , the fate was better .
When they went inside the cave , suddenly due to heavy rains , a lot of water was accumulated near the cave gate .
You can imagine when you see death in front of adolescence and you have to spend moments then how will that moment be
On one hand, he was battling the crisis, on the other hand humanity was uniting all over the world and revealing the human qualities of God.
People all over the world were praying to get these children out safely
Everyone, whether there are governments, these children's parents, their families should be, media, citizens of the country - everyone showed a unique conduct of peace and patience.
All of them were engaged in their mission as a team
In this entire operation a young man from Thailand's Navy also lost his life
The whole world is surprising that he did not leave his hope with so bravery and patience in a dark cave full of water , except for such difficult situations .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things
Just need us to pay attention to your goal with a calm and stable mind, work for him
Neerj ji , the beloved poet of our country , left us .

However , the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
Because this is the time when the collages have peak season
Millions of young people like Satyam leave school and go to colleges

July is the month when young people stand in that new phase of their lives when the Cocus goes away from executions and goes to Cut-o.
The students ' attention goes from home to hostel
Students come in the processors shadow from the shadow of Parents
I'm sure my young friends will be very excited and happy about the beginning of life.
For the first time to go out of the house, go out of the village, get out of a protective environment and make yourself your partner
All such youths leave their homes for the first time, come out to give a new direction to their life
Many students have so far joined their colleges, some will be responsible
I'm gonna tell you this thing, funny life, enjoy a lot of interference in life
There is no choice without books, studio has to be done, but the tendency to find new things should continue
Old friends have their own glory
Childhood friends are valuable, but to choose, make and maintain new friends, it works as a very big understanding in itself
Learn some new, like new schools, learn new languages
Those young people who have left their homes and have gone to some other place, discover those places, know about them, the people there, the language, the culture, the tourist spots there - go there, know about them.
The new innings are starting , all young men have my good wishes .
His father sucks the garbage and sustains his family
I congratulate them for their success .
There are many students who are from the poor family and with their hard work and passion for the opposite conditions, they have shown something that inspires us all
Ahmedabad's Bitiya Afreen Sheikh, whose father Lauto Rickshaw runs, the daughter of Nagpur is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick and brick
Ramesh also used to sell toys in the fair or the late daughter of Gurgaon Anushka Panda, who is suffering from a genetic disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy from birth, all of them crossed every obstacle with their determination and encouragement and achieved such success in the world.
If we look around us, we'll get many such examples
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to tell the sky of the earth, I have to call every darkness in the light, I have to sword with the smell of flowers, and I have to wake up the mountains of Ga-ga, my dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a News, wrote - Two youths did Modi's dream
The incident was that once the San Jose city of America, known as Technology ub, I was discussing with Indian youth
I had appealed to them how they can use their talent for India, think and take time to do something
I had appealed to turn Brain-rain into brain-gain
Using his professional skills , Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together have prepared a SmartGaun App
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile .
This village of Rae Bareli, residents of Taudakpur, Village-Prince, District Magistrate, all the people made people aware of the use of this app
If you see this incident closely, then one thing will come to mind, he will have left India alive in the US, living in the lives of the youth, thinking and thinking of it many years ago, but still knows the nuances of his village, understands the challenges and the community is connected to the village.
For this reason, he probably could make something according to what the village wants.
The feeling of this connectivity with your village, its roots and doing something for the existence is naturally within every Indian.
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to ecosystems, there is a light look on it, but if a small scream is touched, then all things emerge once again and they pull towards their past days.
We also check out somewhere in our case, it has not happened, the situation, the situation, the distances have not separated us anywhere, the rakh has not stopped.
Thank you very much for your phone all
Indeed Pandharpur Wari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Parents Ashwadi Ekadshi, who was on July 23 this year, is also celebrated as a grand environment of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15 - 20 days before Ashwadi Ekadshi , Varakari i . e . pilgrims come out on foot to visit Pandharpur along with palanquins .
This journey, which is called Wari, includes millions of verses
Saints like Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram walk towards Pandharpur on foot instead of singing, singing and singing in the palanquin
Tirthankaras reach there to visit Lord Vithal , who is also called Vithova or Panduranga .
God protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense reverence among the people there, devotion
Going to the Vithova temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty, spiritual pleasure have its own experience
I insist on the listeners of the mind that once you get the opportunity , you must experience the Pandharpur Wari .
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - Innumerous saints are still educating people in Maharashtra
They are giving strength to fight against superstition and in every corner of India this saint has been inspiring tradition .
Whether it is their brotherhood or disillusioned, we get an important message of harmony, love and brotherhood from them.
It has a mantra to fight society with faith against superstition .
These were those people who stopped the society from time to time, showed the tokka and mirror and ensured that old evil practices are over from our society and people come to rituals, equality and purity.
Our homeland is multiple Vasundhara like a great tradition of saints in our country, in the same way, the great men dedicated to the potential mother-Bharti, dedicated this land to their lives, dedicated it.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left his deep impression in the mind of many Indians .
We remember Tilak ji's birth anniversary on July 23 and his death anniversary on August 01
The folk were full of courage and self - confidence .
They had the power and intelligence of the British rulers to show their mistakes .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to treason three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I want to keep an interesting event associated with Lokmanya Tilak and one of his statue in Ahmedabad today in front of the countrymen
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, in that time, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad about 100 years ago and during the visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had got an opportunity to talk to him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 01, 1920, he had decided that he would make his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and immediately he chose Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and it was named Victoria Garden which was in the name of the ueen of Britain .
Finally, the statue was ready and Sardar Saheb was not from anybody else but 28 February 1929 - inaugurated it with Mahatma Gandhi and the most funny thing was in that inaugural ceremony, in that speech, Pooja Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got one person but he has also got the courage to build the statue of Tilak.
And my dear countrymen, the characteristic of this statue is that it is such a rare statue of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, in which he has written right below Tilak, Swaraj is our birth right and it is all the time of the British I am listening
The tradition of public Ganesh festival began with the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji .
Public Ganesh festival, along with traditional reverence and festival, became an effective medium of pursuing the sense of social-Jagaran, collectivity, people's harmony and equality.
At the same time, it was a period when it was necessary that the country be united to fight against the British, these festivals worked to unite everyone by breaking the obstacles of caste and sect.
Popularity of these events increased over time
This shows that our ancient legacy and our heroic heroes of history still have craw in our youth - generation
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh-Pandal in almost every street .
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn properties like Leadership and Organization, they can develop within themselves
I had also urged last time and when I am remembering Lokmanya Tilak ji, I will again urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival this time too, celebrate Ganesh festival, celebrate G-Jan, but urge Eco-Rindly Ganesh to celebrate
From the statue of Ganesh ji to the luggage of decoration, everything is eco-rendali and I would like to have different competitions of the Deco Rendly Ganesh festival in every city, they should be rewarded and I would like to be kept on MyGov and on Narendra Modi App also for extensive publicity of the eco-rendly Ganesh festival.
I shall surely bring you to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self - confidence among the people of the country , he gave a slogan , Swaraj is our prestigious right and we will be with us .
Today it is time to say that Swaraj is our birth - minded right and we will take it .
Every Indian should have good results of good governance and development .
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad .
What will be the young man in India who will not be inspired to hear these lines, the desire of Sarfroshi is now in our hearts, see how much external is in the murder, these lines inspired many young people like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrasekhar Azad's bravery and his passion for freedom, it inspired many youths
Azad put his life on the claim, but he never bowed before foreign rule
It was my privilege that I also had the privilege of going to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh .
Chandrashekhar Azad Park of Allahabad also got an opportunity to offer reverence and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was the heroic men who did not want to die by the bullets of foreigners - if he lives, fights and dies, even if he would die, he would die from freedom. This was his specialty.
Once again I bow down to the two great gods of Bharat Mata , Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji .
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has created history by winning gold medal in the junior under-20 world athletics championship running in Linland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhaiwan, told Indonesia in response to my letter that she is now preparing for Asian Games
-Mail writes unity, the most important moment in the life of any athlete is when he catchs the tricolor and I am proud that I showed it
Ekta is also proud of us all
You have illuminated the country ' s name
In Tunisia , unity won Gold and Brone Medal in World Para Athletics Grand Pri 2018
Their achievement is because they made their challenge the medium of their success .
Daughter unity in 2003, due to Rud accident, half of his body's lower part failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and achieved this position while strengthening herself
Another Divisional Yogesh Kathunia ji, he has won gold medal in Grand Pri in Discus Throw in Grand Pri, along with Sunder Singh Gurjar also won gold medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, many events of history in August, are full of festivals, but due to the weather sometimes the disease also enters the house.
I wish you all the best for health, the inspiration of patriotism, for this August month and for many celebrations going on for centuries, many good wishes.
Then , once again , we shall surely get to talk about the mind .
Namaskar
My dear countrymen have once again been lucky to be with you in this program of mind .
Just a few days ago a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore
You must have understood that I am talking about India and Afghanistan's Test match
This was Afghanistan ' s first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India .
Both teams performed well in this match and another Afghan baller Rashid Khan did this year II
I remember that Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani had written me on his twitter and the people of Afghanistan were very proud of their hero Rashid Khan .
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to show their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
He's the Casset of the world of Cricket, and along with that he didn't even write it in a little funny way, we're not gonna give him to anyone.
This match will be a memorable for all of us
Well this was the first match , so remembering is very natural but I ' ll remember this match for a particular reason .
Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What can a winner team do while taking a trophy
- Indian team, while taking a trophy, the team of Afghanistan who was playing international match for the first time invited the team of Afghanistan and both teams took photos together
What happens to sportsman sprit, sportsmanship - - we can experience this one incident
The skills of the sports society and the skills of our youth, the talent they have is a ruthless way to find out.
My dear countrymen had a different view on the fourth yoga day on June 21 .
The whole world looked united
European Parliament in Brussels, be the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, Japanese ninth-service fighter ships, people see yoga everywhere
For the first time in Saudi Arabia , there was a historic programme of yoga and I have been told that a lot of asanas have been demonstrated by women
On the high snow peaks of Ladakh the soldiers of India and China have done yoga together .
Yoga works to break all limits, add
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries made this opportunity a huge festival by going beyond caste, religion, region, color or gender all kinds of distinction
If the people around the world were taking part in the programs of Yoga Day so excited and why would not it be multiplied in India
Our warriors of the IAF , in the midst of the sky , hymned everyone by doing yoga at an altitude of 15 thousand feet .
The sight was that they swimming in the air, not sitting in the airplane
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, high prayers or sports grounds, yoga was done everywhere
Yoga has worked to unite the people of the world by going beyond caste, creed and geography, the feeling of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have won for centuries.
Our Rishi, Muni, saint, who always emphasizes, Yoga has proved him in the right sense
Most people will make it part of their lives .
Many people on MyGov and NarendramodiApp have written to me that I ' ll talk about the coming Octobers Day on July 1 in the mind of this time - the right thing is
We are those people who worship mother as god, believe in God because mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, many times the doctor regenerates us.
The role of a doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today the doctor has a medical examination, as well as he has a deep experience about general life style trands, what impact he has on our health, all of them.
Indian doctors have made their identification worldwide with their capacity and skills
In the medical procession, Maharat, along with hardworking, is known to solve our doctor complex medical professions.
We are lucky people who have been born in this India land
India has a rich history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which no historic incident has happened.
If you see , there is one heritage of everywhere in India .
There is a saint associated with it, there is no great man, no famous person, everyone has his own contribution, his greatness
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Magahar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you know very well the Kabirvad of Gujarat
When I used to work there, I also had a big, national session of people associated with a saint Kabir's tradition.
You people know why Kabirdas ji had gone to Magahar
At that time there was a belief that the person who died in Magahar does not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that renounces in Kashi goes to heaven
Magahar was considered insane , but Saint Kabirdas did not believe it .
That is how they broke their evil deeds and the blind ones of their time , and they forgot , and they embraced it .
Saint Kabirdas ji emphasized social equality, peace and brotherhood through his credentials and duals
These were their ideals
We see this ideal in his writings , and in today ' s era he is as inspired .
The true Pir saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of others, who do not know the sorrow of others, they are ineffective
Kabirdas ji gave special emphasis on social harmony
They thought far ahead of their time .
It'll put you, please all coins
Kabir writes in another double - where there is mercy and religion, where the iron is sin
He said: - Do not ask caste, seek knowledge
This is the greatness of the guru and a similar guru, Jagatguru guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed sanmarg to the Koti-Koti people, continue to inspire for centuries
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
Wherever they went , they took many initiatives for the betterment of society .
The system of free kitchen from social discrimination, where every caste, religion, religion or sect could come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev only started this anchoring system.
550th light festival of Guru Nanak Dev ji will be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and humility
You also urged the people to celebrate the 550th light festival of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the whole society and how to celebrate it all over the world, what are new ideas, what are new ideas, what are new imaginations, we think about it, prepare and with great pride, we all make this light festival inspiration.
My dear countrymen
The struggle of India's freedom is very long, very wide, is deep, innumerable is full of martyrdoms
There is another history associated with Punjab
In 2019 , the 100 years of the horrific incident of the Jallianwala Bagh , which embarrassed the entire humanity .
How do we remember this 100 years of this incident, we can all think about it, but we always remember the immortal message given by this incident, this problem can never be solved with violence and cruelty.
Vijay always belongs to peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Sriman Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, wrote on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's birthday is on July 6 and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was very good to see your interest in India ' s history
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people must know that on the invitation of Dr . Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937 Sri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had addressed the convocation at Kolkata University in Bengali language .
This was the first time when the British ruled and someone at the University of Kolkata addressed convocation in Bengali language
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India and in one sense, he had laid the foundation stone of India's industrial development, prepared a strong base, prepared a strong platform.
Dr Mukherjee's dream was India is industrially self-sufficient, efficient and prosperous in every field
They wanted India to develop big industries and also pay full attention to MSMs, handlooms, clothes and cottage industries
They were quite pacifying about the development of West Bengal
The result of their understanding, discretion and activism is that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still part of India.
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was India's integrity and unity - and for this he also lost his life at the young age of 52.
We always remember the message of the unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, with the feeling of goodwill and brotherhood, continue to live for India's progress
In the last few weeks , I got an opportunity to communicate with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video calls .
The changes in people's life are coming beyond the files, they got the opportunity to know directly from them.
People told their resolve, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements
I believe it was not just a government program for me but it was a different kind of Learning Experience and what could happen in anybody's life when the happiness that was seen on the face of the people during this time
When he listened to the stories of a common human (human), his foolish words touched the heart, what he was saying of his experience
In remote villages, daughters are providing services from the pension of the villages through the Common Service Center to the post-mortem.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and does business by making her life-cream
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of young people of the country are running medicine centers as well as going to villages nearby and providing cheap medicines.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two to three years ago and now he is doing his successful business only.
Not only this, ten-fifteen people are also giving jobs
Students from Tamilnadu, Punjab, Goa school are working on a important topic like awaste management in the teachering lab of school at their young age.
No matter how many stories were there, there would be no corner of the country where people do not have to talk about their success
In such an environment, when ordinary humans (human) comes with new hope, new glory and incidents in their life, then they do not credit the government.
The incident of a small girl of a small village far and wide also becomes inspiration for hundreds of millions of people
With the help of Technology for me, a moment of spending time with beneficiaries through Video bridge is very happy, very inspiring and it also gets the satisfaction of working but also gets the enthusiasm to do more work
Another new joy of spending life for a poor man, another new enthusiasm, another new inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge program and you did the job of giving me new power
I once again want to thank you all
I always feel, if we look around us, something or the other is good.
There are people doing good .
We can also feel the aroma of good .
In the past one thing came in my mind and it ' s a big strange combination
While there are prosionals and engineers on one side, on the other hand, our farmers associated with farming are brothers and sisters
T Engineers came along with them, they have made a simple prosperity trust in collaboration and they double the income of the farmers, for this the Trust has activated.
Joining farmers, making plans and making successful efforts to increase the income of farmers
Farmers who produce grains are also associated with it .
On one hand , farmers have a major role in the entire sector from crop production to marketing , while on the other hand , efforts are made to ensure their rights ensuring participation in profits .
The crop is good, it has been made separate sead-bank for good breed seeds.
Women see the work of this sead-bank, women have also been added
I congratulate these youths very much for this innovative use and I am happy that these youths associated with the world of professionals,technocrats, engineering have adopted the way to join the village, join the village and join the farmer from their scope.
I once again, my country's young-boys have their innovative experiments, something that maybe I have to go, something will not go, some people will know, some will not know, but continuous coti-coti people are doing something well, they all have a lot of good wishes from me.
GST is going to be completed for one year, Ne Nation, Neta was dreaming of the people of the country, she has turned into right today
If I have to give the most credit to anybody for this, then I give credit to the states
GST is an excellent example of Cooperative Deteralism, where all the states together decided in the country and then went to the country to implement such a big tax reform
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can all proud that people of different political ideology sit there, people of different states sit, there are different states, but despite all the decisions made in the GST Council so far have been done unanimously.
Before GST , 17 different types of taxes used to happen in the country but in this system now only one tax is applicable in the whole country
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a festival of honesty
In the first country, inspectorraj's complaints used to come in the case of taxa .
From Reuturn to Reund everything happens through online information technology
With the arrival of GST, the check post ended and the movement of goods became fast, which is not only saving time but also getting a lot of benefit in the Logistics sector.
GST will probably be the world's largest ta farm
In India such a big ta farm was successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST could be ensured only through public power .
Normally it is believed that such a big Reorm, such a big country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to complete it, but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the celebration of the country's honesty, represents the participation of the people's power, that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, it has achieved stability and it also improves its input system according to the requirement.
Through the point of mind , once again you have the chance to be the most rubber .
You will remember people well, 6 women commanders of nine-sena, this group was on a sea trip for the last several months.
boating ocean circumambulation - - I want to talk about them
These six daughters of India, their team has two children and it is our dates - more than 250 days through sea
NS Tarini has returned to India on 21st May and the whole country welcomed him very warmly
He travelled in different oceans and many seas and distanced about twenty thousand natural miles
This was one of the first events in the world .
On Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet all these daughters, listen to their experiences
I once again congratulate these daughters for their adventure, to increase the reputation of Navi, to increase India's respect and respect, especially the world, that India's daughters are not less - these messages.
Who does not know the sense of adventure
If we see the development journey of human race, then progress has arisen in the womb of any other Adventure.
develops only in the lap of adventure .
Intending to do something, something to do away from the leak, something to do indecisive, I can do something - these feelings, maybe less, but for ages, Koti-coti people get inspiration.
On May 16, 5 tribal children of an ashram-schule in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Tribal students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam, a group of these tribal children climbed the world's highest peak
These students of Ashram-Schul started firing in August 2017, Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - they were injured
These youths were chosen under Mission Shaurya and they have honored the whole country with the name of Verest .
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur school, these little companions of me, very much thanks to the heart
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman who defeated West from Nepal
Best wishes to daughter Shivangi

This work is admirable, as well as shows their commitment to cleanliness, environment
For years people have been climbing Verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these brave heroes, especially the daughters of the heart.
So large numbers of people from every field will come forward in its subordinate
When I talk about it I India, I believe that as much as we play, the country will play
People on social media are sharing Videos of itness challenge, tagging each other into it and challenging them
In the matter of mind many times, in relation to players, you have listened to me some things and the last time, our hero of the Commonwealth Games, our minds, were telling us through this program - Namaskar Sir
Image Yadav ji, thank you much for your phone call
It is true that the games which were sometimes part of the life of every child, are becoming less today
These games were particularly part of summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that at different places he was known with different names, like now this game is known as many names
Nobody knows how many names of Lagori, Satolia, Seven Stones, Dicori, Satodia are the same game
There are two types of games in traditional sports .
There are also out doors, indoor too
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known in different places, different names
I am from Gujarat I know there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal-Isto
It is played with codies or immli seeds or dice and with 88 ' s square board
This game was played almost in every state .
We also used to do this game .
Which of us will be, who has not played the gillie-danda in childhood
Gillie-Danda is a game to play from village to cities
It is known by different names in different parts of the country
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla
In Orissa it is called Gulibadi and it is called fiscal in Maharashtra .
Some games have one of their own seasons
You must have seen many children, who are embarrassed but become very narrow while playing
Dad and grandfather, when they play everything from children, they say no generation gap, hey, he also gets touched.
At the same time we also know our culture and traditions
Many games also make us aware of society, environment etc.
through crowd sourcing we can create a very large architecture of our traditional games
Videos of these games can be created, in which rules of sports can be shown about the way to play
On June 5 our country will officially host India to World Environment Day
This is a very important achievement for India and it is also acknowledging India ' s growing leadership in the world to reduce climate change .
This time theme is Beat plastic pollution
I appeal to all of you, understanding the value of this theme, we all make sure we don't use Polythene, Low Grade plastic and try to reduce the plastic pollution which is on our nature, on Wild Lie and on our health,
Go to World Environment Day's website weed-India2018 and all the suggestions there have been given in a very interesting manner - see, and try to bring them to your daily life.
In the last few weeks, we all saw that in different areas of the country there was dust and half, along with strong winds, heavy rains, which is unseasonal.
Death was also done, goods and losses
We have to live with nature with harmony, live with nature
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this every step throughout the life
When India played a key role in the Copp21 and Paris Agreement when we united the whole world through international solar alliance , all of them had a sense of fulfilling that dream of Mahatma Gandhi .
On this environment day, we all think about what can we do to make our planet clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovative
My beloved countrymen , especially my young companions
You remember the same thing on June 21, not only you, but all the world remembers June 21.
For the whole world on June 21 is celebrated as International Yoga Day and it has been accepted and people start preparing months ago
News is getting these days, preparations are being made to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21 all over the world.
Centuries ago this thing is directly meant that on doing regular yoga practice some good qualities become like relatives and friends .
Yoga creates courage that always protects us like a father
Forgiveness arises as Mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, mercy, our sister, self-reliant brother, our own earth becomes our bed and knowledge.
When all these qualities become partners , the Yogi overcomes all kinds of fear .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their legacy of yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation
Today May 27 is the death anniversary of India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
I pray to Panditji
The memory of this month is also associated with another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857, when Indians showed their strength to the British
Our soldiers and farmers in many parts of the country stood in protest against injustice showing their bravery
It is sad that we have been calling the events of 1857 for a long time as a rebellion or a soldier rebellion .
Indeed , that incident was not only reduced to borrowing , but also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that in the month the first independent war of independence started, Veer Savarkar ji was born in that month.
Savarkar ji ' s personality was full of features
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
Atal ji had done accurate picture
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also adventurous revolutionary
I was watching a story on TV, of our poor daughters of the raw settlements of Sikar in Rajasthan
Our daughters, who were ever compelled to ask for garbage from bearing to home - today they are learning the work of sewing and washing clothes to cover the poor.
Here's the daughters, today, apart from the clothes of yourself and your family, are shaking from normal to good clothes.
They are also course of skill development along with it
Our daughters today are self-sufficient and are living their lives with respect and have become a power for their families
I wish these daughters , full of hope and faith , their glorious future .
He has shown that if you are determined to do something and you are determined to do it , success can also be achieved between all the difficulties , and it is not just a matter of learning , but in every corner of India you will see all this .
If you look at the neighborhood, you will come to mind how people defeat the problems
You must have felt that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, some people together have discussions and discussions.
This discussion is also political, social also happens, there is also a movie, players and players also happen on the problems of the country - that is such a problem - it should be solved - but often these things are limited to discussion but some people, who move forward to change their work, their hard work and feeling.
Some such story of buying dreams of others and to fulfill them, D. Prakash Rao, living in the slums of Katak city of Orissa,
Yesterday I got the privilege to meet D. Prakash Rao
Sriman D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades
They make full arrangements for education, health and food to all children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao's hard work, his passion and a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have abolished the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the whole country
Let us proceed with positiveness
It is so hot in the month of June that people wait for rain and look at the clouds in the sky in hope .
After a few days , people will wait for the moon .
Showing moon means that Eid can be celebrated
After a month ' s fast during Ramadan , the festival of Eid is a symbol of celebration .
I am confident that all people will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm , especially children will get good Eid on this occasion .
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bondage of goodwill in our society .
Best wishes to everyone
My dear countrymen thank you all very much
Then , once next month , we ' ll meet in the mind .
Talk of mind, April 2018

Ruma Devnath writes, from Morning Walk, I feel myself afflicted and healthy and she further says.
Make an opportunity to learn these holidays for a new experience my dear countrymen
When we hear that in the future there are wars about water in the world , everyone speaks , but is there any responsibility for us
Do we not think water conservation should be this social responsibility

My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmer as an important part of the country's economy and common life.
The feeling of Mahatma Gandhi's attachment to soil, farm and peasant and farmer glimpses in this line, when he said - To order how to diagnose the Earth and tend to the soil, is to work for Ourselves.Yani, dug the earth and take care of the soil If we forget, then it is like forgetting ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri used to often emphasize the need for trees, plants and vegetable protection and better agricultural structure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of public awareness on a large scale to ensure better income, better irrigation and facilities for our farmers and to increase food and milk production.
This territorial state has shown great work .

My dear countrymen, on April 14, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had spoken of India's industrialization.
For them the industry was an effective medium in which employment could be provided to the poorest person.
Today India has emerged as a Brigt Spot in the global economy and today the world ' s most original ID
The whole world is looking at India as B for investment innovation and development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible in the cities, due to which Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar relied on India's urbanization, urbanization
Moving forward this vision, Smart Citizens Mission and urban Mission were started in the country today so that every kind of facility in big cities and small towns of the country - whether it is good roads, water arrangements, health facilities, education or digital connectivity can be provided.
Baba Saheb's self-reliance, there was strong faith in self-reliance
They did not want any soul to live their lives in evil .
At the same time , they also believed that their poverty could not be overcome by just parting in the poor .
India, stand p I India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young interpreters
In the 1930s and 1940s, when there was talk of roads and railways only in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways
These were Dr. Baba Saheb who saw water and power as nation-power
Today historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country
New ports are being built on different sea shores of India and interstructurer is being strengthened at old ports
During the 40's period, most of the discussions were about 2nd World War, Demerging of Old-ar and Partition - at that time, Dr. Ambedkar did in a way.
The foundation of India's Spirit
He talked about the importance of edralism, federal system and emphasized on working together with the Center and the states for the upliftment of the country.
Today we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, co-operative leadership and competitive cooperative leadership in every aspect of governance and the most important thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me associated with backward classes.
He has shown us that it is not necessary to move forward that it is born in a big or rich family, but people born in poor families in India can also see their dreams, try to fulfill those dreams and can also achieve success.
Yes, this happened when many people ridiculed Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
India belongs to Ambedkar, the poor belongs to the backward
On the occasion of birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar, village-swaraj campaign is being organized from April 14 to May 5
Under this, there will be different programs on village-development, poor-calculation and social-jurisdiction throughout India.
My, you all urge to take part in this campaign
My dear countrymen, many festivals are coming in the next few days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is the day of recalling his sacrifice and penance .
The life of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire us all
Best wishes of Mahavir Jayanti to all the countrymen
As soon as the discussion comes, Lord remembers the inspirational teachings of Jesus Christ, who have always given humanity the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in those days, twin and Satwin in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and the happiness and glee of Poila Vaishakh in West Bengal will be shadowed.
All these festivals are connected to our fields and fields and food grains in some form, through these festivals we thank nature for unmatched gifts received as a produce.
Glad tidings of all the festivals that come to you once again .
Today in the beginning the talk of mind starts from a phone call itself .
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water
Have we ever thought that the river is, the sea is, why the water becomes colorful
This question came in the mind of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist from modern India .
When we talk about science, the first name of Indo-Ratan Sir C.V. Raman comes in front of us
One of their foods is known as Raman Dect .
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year because it is said that on this day he had announced the incident of Lift scattering, for which he was awarded noble.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in science .
On one side there is a tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, while on the other hand there are good and charak in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the glory of India
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose , the name of Kamous particle Boson was also done .
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in science
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smarter than seal learning
Can you help farmers on the yield of fruits
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I got an opportunity to go to Gujarat, inaugurate the UI Reete in Ahmedabad.
Science and Technology are vulue neutral
They don't have values, themselves
any machine will do the same thing as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to work from the machine
Thomas Alva Disson , who invented Wift Bulb , failed many times in his experiments
Once asked about this, they replied I've searched ten thousand ways of not making Lift Bulb, i.e. Dison also made his failures his power.
Unfortunately , today I am in Auroville , the workingplace of the Maharshi Arabs .
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life
Answered and guided humanity
Repeated questions to know the truth, is important
The real motivation behind the scientific food is also this .
Till then, you should not sit with cheer till why, how and how can you get answers
I congratulate all our scientists, all the people associated with science on the occasion of National Science Day
Comrades, at the time of Crisis, Safety, Disaster many times come to me on all these subjects, people keep writing something to me.
Sriman Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken at his computer at the Narendramodi Mobile App.
They have written that in our country extraordinarily and constraints are not so good on the systems
On March 4, India's National Safety Day, then the Prime Minister should talk about the security in the program of his mind so that awareness about the health among the people increased
If we are not aware of health in daily life, they are unable to achieve it then it becomes difficult to get it during disaster
We all read the boward written on the roads many times, it says that alertness has decreased, one forgetful loss, cheerful happiness and smile, - Do not leave the world so soon, do not leave the relationship with security - No fun, otherwise life will be cheaper than that. Sometimes there is no use in our lives.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, then we can protect our lives, but, even with great accidents, we can save society
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of sources have been written on the workplace but when they see, it doesn't seem to be followed anywhere.
As far as disasters are concerned, Disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversities in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many provincial and human-made disasters such as chemical and industrial accidents
Initiatives have also been called disaster friends for the training of volunteers in floods, cyclones in dangers.
Training and awareness is a very important role
Two-three years ago thousands of people used to lose their lives every year from Luheat Wave
After this, NMA organized workshop for management of heatwave, campaigned to create awareness among the people
A good result came out from everyone ' s participation
In 2017, the number of deaths due to Lu has decreased unexpectedly to 220
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get protection
There are countless people working in this way in the society, there are social organizations, aware citizens - I want to appreciate all those who get disaster anywhere, in the minutes of relief and rescue work.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscious society
In our culture, we often talk about the defense, security of values, but we have to understand values of safety, security
We have to make it a part of our life
I mean , what was the arrangement of giving information
Why
Because we are not naturally conscious and so listen to our ears, airplanes after sitting, but this information is for me, so none of us thinks of it
We have the same experience in every field of life .
We don't think that the society is for someone else, if we all become aware of our health, the sense of society's health is also inherent.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, it was emphasized to create health and waste to energy through biogas for villages under clean India.
Initiatives were started for this and it was named GBAR-Han - Galvaniing Crganic Bio-Agro Resources
The purpose of this GBAR-Han scheme is to clean the villages and convert the solid waste curtains of animal dung and fields into MPST and BI-GAS, to generate money and energy from it
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other organic wastes for the production of energy but its full potential was not being used in India .
Under Swachh Bharat Mission Rural now we are moving forward in this direction
The goal of the cattle dung, waste from agriculture, waste coming out of the kitchen house, all of them have been determined to use biogas based energy
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters, brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste as a source of income rather than as a source of income
Gobar Dhan Yojana will help rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase
Self - sufficiency will increase in the case of energy for cooking and lifting from biogas
Farmers and animal husbands will help in increasing income
New jobs will be available for East Collection, Transportation, sale of biogas etc.
For the smooth arrangement of the Gobar Dhan Yojana , a online trading platform will also be created which connect farmers with buyers so that farmers can get the right price of dung and agriculturalwaste
I urge entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India to take full advantage of this opportunity by creating a cell help group, making cooperative committees.
I invite you to become participants of this movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs in your village to convert Waste into wealth and make dung drinks from dung
My dear countrymen, till date, we have heard about how many types of festivals we do not know about music festivals, loud festivals, film festivals.
But the first garbage festival of the state was organized while making a unique effort in Raipur in Chhattisgarh
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness and to create awareness about various ways of re-using the carbage of the city.
During this festival, there was a variety of activity in which from students to elders, everyone joined
Different kinds of artworks were made using waste
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of Caste Management
Inspired by Raipur, there were different kinds of garbage festivals in other districts too.
Everyone initiated on their behalf, innovative issues about cleanliness, share, discussions, poem read
A festival was ready for cleanliness
Especially the way schoolchildren took part in it was amazing
For the innovative manner in which the importance of fast management and cleanliness was displayed in this festival, I will teach the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration there.
International Women's Day is celebrated on March 8 every year
There are many programs in the country and the world .
On this day, women are also protected from the Women's Power Award in the country who have done imitating work in different areas in the past.
On this occasion I recall the promise of Swami Vivekananda .
He had said that this idea of Swamiji expresses the contemplation of women's power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure participation of equality of women in every field of social, economic life, it is our responsibility.
We are part of that tradition, where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Poत्र, this was the identity of a son
They have pursued themselves , and have worked to pursue the country and society and take them to a new position .
In the past , I was given a very good suggestion by a great ocean .
He suggested that on March 8, like celebrating women's day, there are programs in every village-shahar who have completed 100 years
Can the program of honor of such mothers and children be organized  And can there be talk of a long life in it
Under this campaign started from January 26, 2018, these women have created a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh credentials, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representative, 29 thousand water-sahiya, 10 thousand women cleaning and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big the event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women's power is a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will continue to change the hygiene campaign in normal life effectively in the nature of public opinion.
Brother-in-law, just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and so much happiness and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know, Elephanta island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai
I am surprised to know that despite being near Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years of freedom
For 70 years, three villages of the Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Moribandar and Sentbandar, the dark shadow in the life of the people there, now it is sixth and their life has been illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the public there .
I am happy that now the caves of Elephanta and Elephanta will be lighted with electricity .
This is not just a power, but a new beginning of the era of development.
The life of the countrymen is illuminated, happiness comes in his life, what can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness
My dear brothers and sisters, now we celebrate the festival of Shivaratri
Now the month of March, the farms decorated with flourishing crops, the golden girls of the wheat and the mangoes that bridge the mind - this is the specialty of this month.
But it is also very fond of all of us for the month Holi festival .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi festival with happiness
Holi is equally important for colors because this day is the day of burning evils into the fire .
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all hearts and minds together, to become part of each other's happiness and happiness and gives message of love unity and brother-in-law
Best wishes of Holi colorful celebrations to all the countrymen, colorful best wishes
This festival is full of colorful happiness in our countrymen ' s life - this is the best wish
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, I have written a long letter to Sriman Prakash Tripathi on the NarendramodiApp and have urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written, on February 1, Kalpana Chawla's death date is going to the interior.
He left us in the Columbia Interview Accident but inspired millions of youth around the world .
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has started in his long letter with the farewell of Kalpana Chawla .
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age, but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, especially India that there is no limit for women and power.
There is nothing impossible if there is a desire and determination, if there is a duty to do something.
It is very happy to see that in India today women are moving faster in every field and increasing the pride of the country
Since ancient times, respect for women in our country, place in their society and their contribution, it has wondered the whole world
There is a long tradition of Indian enmity .
Many of India's evils have been contributing to the wheels of Vedas
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi do not know how many names
It shows the importance of women in our society .
And then, in our society, women have been given power status
This female power hinders the whole country, all the society, the family, the source of unity
Sriman Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples
He has written that our adventurous defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft will fly in Sukhoi 30, inspire them
Three brave women have created feelings, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi Dighter Pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30
Efficiency Vajpayee-led All Women Rue from Delhi to San Rancisco of America and back to Delhi
India flew to the Boeing Jet - and all the women
In the past, Honorable President ji took a new initiative
President ji met a group of extraordinary women who first showed something in their respective areas
The first woman in the country's young agents, First Emle Merchant Navie Apptain, Passenger Train, first woman Trein River, first woman Bus River, Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, in this way, the first woman to reach Everest, the first woman to reach Everest - our natives, breaking the rivalry of society, established an unusual achievement.
He showed that a new route can be prepared by crossing all the obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, passion and determination.
A book has also been prepared on these women officers, first ladies so that the whole country can take inspiration from these women's powers, their lives and their works.
This is also available as e-book on the Narendra Modi website
Today, the country has an important role in women's power in positive changes in the country and society.
Today , when we ' re discussing women ' s empowerment , I ' d like to mention a railway station
A railway station and women's empowerment, you must think what is connection in the meantime
Mumbai ' s Matunga station is the first station in India where all women employees are
In all the departments, Women Sta - Whether it is Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Hecking, Announcing, Point Person, the whole is the status of more than 40 women.
This time many people wrote on Twitter and other social media after watching the Republic Day Parade that there was a main point of parade, BS Biker Contingent in which all the women were participating.
Were using adventurously and these scenes were surprising the guests coming from abroad
Empowerment is the only form of self-reliance
Today our women's power is leading
Being self - sufficient
When tribal women come to light, a certain picture emerges in everyone's mind, in which there is a jungle, there are turbans, the burden of wood on them is carried out on the head.
But our tribal woman of Chhattisgarh, our woman-skriti has made a new picture in front of the country
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is the Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible environment of this
Tribal women in such dangerous areas are becoming self-reliant by running Rickshaw
Many women have joined it in a very short period .
I also appreciate the illa administration here, from providing Grants to Training, the ila administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leave what is out of time, accept the improvement of what is necessary
Any life-sacrifice is identified by its cellorecting Mechanism
Continuous efforts have been being made in our country for centuries against social misconceptions and misconceptions .
Bihar has taken a interesting initiative just a few days ago
To overcome social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers was made Kuman Hain.
Through this campaign people were made aware of the evils like child-marriage and dowry.
The whole state resolved to fight with dowry and child-marriage
Children, elderly, zealous and enthusiastic youth, mothers, sisters were all involved in this war
Starting from Patna's historic Gandhi Maidan, the human range continued to join the borders of the state.
For all the people of the society to get the benefit of development in the right sense , our society must be free from these evils .
Let us all combine to eliminate such evils from the society and a new II
India, build a strong and capable India
I appreciate every person involved in Bihar's public, state chief minister, its administration and human chain that he took such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My beloved countrymen, Mysore, Karnataka's Sriman Darshan wrote on My Gov, the cost of medicines was 6 thousand rupees a month on his father's treatment.
He did not know about the first Prime Minister's Public Relations Scheme
But now when they got information about the public medicine center and they bought medicines from there then their cost of medicines decreased by 75 percent .
He has expressed his desire to talk about it in a programme of mind so that more and more people can get it and take advantage of it .
For the last few years, many people used to write me about this, keep telling me
gets a deep satisfaction
And I too liked that Mr. Darshan ji's mind came to think that what he got, he also got to others
The objective behind this scheme is to create health fardable and encourage Case of Living .
Medicines available at public medicine centers are about 50 to 90 cheaper than branded medicines sold in the market
This gives very financial help to the public-social, especially the senior citizens who take medicines every day, very saved.
The Generic medicines that are bought in it are according to the fixed standard of the World Health Organization .
That is why good quality medicines are available at cheap prices .
Today more than three thousand public drug centers have been set up across the country
This is not only getting cheap medicines , but also new employment opportunities are being created for I industry .
Affordable medicines are available at the nectar stores of Indian public medicine centers and hospitals
The only purpose behind all these is to provide quality and authority to the poorest person in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created .
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mangesh from Maharashtra, a photo, share on the Narendra Modi Mobile App
That photo was such that my attention was drawn to that photo
That photo was in which a grandson was taking part in the Lean Morna River cleaning campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan .
The Morana river flowed for the first twelve months but now she has become seasonal
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, water cup
On the river and on its shore , sufficient was being thrown .
A exchange plan was prepared and on January 13, a day before Makar-Sankranti, the two edges of the Morana river were cleaned at four kilometer area under the first phase of Mission Lean Morna.
In this good work of Mission Lean Morna, more than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGs, Loleges, Students, children, elderly, parents and children all participated in this
On January 20, 2018, this cleanliness was continued in the same way and I have been told that unless the Morana river is completely clean, this campaign will run every Saturday morning.
It shows that if any man decides to do something , there is nothing impossible .
Big changes can be brought through public movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the administration of the city and the city-nigam, all the citizens engaged in making this work public, your efforts and your efforts will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you will also have to hear a lot of discussion about the Padma-Puraskaras.
In the newspapers, it also attracts attention to T .
Every year there is a tradition of Padma-Purskara but its entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can name anyone
Transparency has come from the completion of the entire process
In a way the selection process of these awards has become complete transformation
Those people who are usually not seen in big cities, in the news, in T.V., in the ceremony
Now there is no identity of the person to give the award, the importance of his work is increasing
You must have heard Mr. Arvind Gupta, you will be happy to know, I
Arvind ji, a student of ICT Kanpur, spent his whole life making toy for children
They have been making toys with waste for four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science .
They try that children are inspired to scientific experiments from useless things, for this, they are going to three thousand schools across the country and showing movies made in 18 languages.
How wonderful life, how wonderful dedication
Similar story of Karnataka's Sitawa Joddati (SI)
They have not been said to be the goddess of women and power
For the last three decades , he has contributed greatly in changing the lives of innumerable women .
He had dedicated himself as Goddesses at the age of seven , but then gave his whole life to the welfare of the Devadasis .
Not only that, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard the name about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family
They used to work generally for living but they were fond of making traditional tribal paintings .
Today, due to this hobby, they have respect not only India but also in the whole world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji , who illuminated India ' s name abroad , was recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri award .
You will be surprised to hear the story of the tribal woman Laxmikutti of Kerala
Laxmikutti is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of card leaves in tribal areas between dense forests.
They have made five hundred herbal medicines based on their memory
He has mastered making medicines used after cutting snakes .
Lakshmiji is constantly serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines .
He was honored with Padmashree for his contribution to the society by identifying this innocence .
I still wish to mention another name today , Subhasini Mistry , 75 , West Bengal , was also chosen for the award .
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in other houses to make hospitals
When they were 23 years old , their husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired them to make the poor a hospital .
Today thousands of poor people are treated freely in their hard work hospital.
I am sure that there are many males and males in our polygamy and Vasundara, many females and males who do not know, nor do anyone know
Do not become the identity of such people, it also loses the society, Padma-Puraskar is a medium, but I will also tell the people of the country that living around us, who are living for the society, who are consumed for the society, with some specialty, Laxative people working for the whole life. Sometimes they should be brought in the middle of the society.
They do not work for honor but because of their work we get inspiration
Sometimes in schools, call such people in colleges and listen to their experiences
Beyond the award, there should be some efforts in society too
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Indian Day
This is 9th January, when the worshiper Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARIA
On this day, we celebrate the untouchables between Indians living in India and around the world.

If you are working in T, then someone is dedicated to Ayurveda, someone brings the mind of the society with his music, then someone from his poems
If someone is researching Climate Change , then someone is working on Indian texts , someone has set up a gurudwara by running a truck , then someone has made a mosque .
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, to recognise the people of Indian origin and to give information to the people around the world through them
On January 30, worship is the death anniversary of Bapu, who has shown us all a new way
On that day we celebrate martyrdom day , on that day we offer homage to the great martyrs who give their lives in the defence of the country .
The path of peace and non-violence, this is Bapu's path
Whether India or the world, whether it is a family or a society-poet Bapu, whatever ideals he has told us, they are still very relevant.
They weren ' t just core signals
At present, we look at the dagger-dagger that Bapu's words were so correct
If we resolve that we can walk on Bapu's path - let's go, then what can be bigger than that
My dear countrymen, give you all the good wishes of 2018, I halt my voice
Where these 18- 25-year-old youth, together, churn on New India, find ways, plans
How shall we prove our resolutions before 2022
How can we build a India dreamed by our freedom fighters
B.
A.
I did not talk to them, there was no nominee of disappointment - enthusiasm, enthusiasm was, energy, dreams, dreams were from those daughters, as long as I spent, I also got inspiration from those daughters, and this is the strength of the country, this is my youth, this is my country's future, my loved countrymen, not only our country, whenever the famous religious places of Kerala are discussed, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala, in this world famous temple, Lord Ayyappa Swami's blessings come here every year. There is such a huge number of devotees here, but how many months he can make such a big challenge
And especially at that place, which is located between the hills and the forests, but how can this problem be changed in the ritual, how can the way to overcome the problem and what is so powerful in public participation - This is the Sabarimala temple in itself as an example.
Who will make such rules
Probably, there will be no citizen of India, who does not respect them, does not respect
They are very bigger than all of us at the age, and they are witnesses of different halts, different rounds of the country.
He, this 28 September is getting 90 years old
Before leaving on a foreign trip, I got good luck to talk to Didi on the phone.
This conversation was the same, like, in a lot of trouble, younger brother, speaks to his elder sister
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I think, Hilata ji: Hamodi ji: I congratulate you on the birthday, I will congratulate you.

Lata ji: ji, I think my parents have blessings, and the blessings of those who listen
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is what is your humility, this is for all of us, this is a great education for all of the new generation, it is a very big impression for us that even after loyalty of all this in your life, your parents' rites and that moisture have always given priority
Lata ji:
Modi ji: And whenever I come to you, ji Modi ji: You fed me something or the other Gujarati

Your letter is also available to me and I also get some of your gifts and messages, then I have a special joy of this one, who is a family relationship.
Lata ji: ji, ji
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble, because, I'm seeing, I know how busy you are and how much work you do
What do you have to think
When, when you came to touch your mother's feet, I also sent someone to him and blessed him.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me

For many weeks, across the country, the festivals will be charming
All of you, all the best wishes of the coming festivals
In festivals, all the family members will come together
Perhaps, these sayings are not just words, we have an order for people, there is a philosophy, an inspiration
Think, on one side, some glitter with light, on the other side, in front of him, some people's houses around, there is dark shadow.
In some houses, sweets are getting worse, so in some houses, children love sweets
The real joy of these festivals is only when, this dark sixth, this darkness is less - the light spreads
We also share happiness there, where, there is lack, and, that's our nature too.
Think about our homes, sweets, clothes, gits, when delivery is in, even a moment, delivery out
At least in our homes, which are in excess, which we don't work anymore, must deliberate out of such things.
In many cities, many NGs work these start-ups of young colleagues
They, from people's homes, clothes, sweets, food, collect everything, find the needy, reach them and do anonymous activity.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, eradicate the darkness under this picture
Smile on the faces of many poor families, festivals, your happiness will double, your face will shine, your face will shine, and you will be lightened, your wall and illumination will be
My beloved brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, in the form of good luck and prosperity, Laxmi's home arrives
In our culture, daughters have been considered Lakshmi, because daughter brings good fortune and prosperity
Can we do the program of honoring this Lakshmi of India on this Diwali
Many daughters around us, many daughters will be such, which will be doing extraordinary work
Nobody will be working for the education of poor children, someone will be engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, so someone will be serving society by becoming a doctor, engineer
By becoming a lawyer, someone will have to try to get justice
Our society, identify such daughters, respect them, and respect them,
Program of their honor, be in the country
One can do more work, that, about the achievements of these daughters, share more and more in social media, and use bharatkilami (Lakshmi of India)
Like we all organized a great academy, she was spread all over the world with Daughter.
Similarly, this time, we run the campaign, Laxmi of India
The encouragement of India ' s Lakshmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen .
My dear countrymen, I had said beforehand that there is a great advantage that I get the good fortune of making direct-resistant dialogue with many unknown people.
In the past, a student from far and wide Arunachal has sent a big interference letter to Alina Tayang,
And it says, I read the letter in front of you. Admiral Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tyang.
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when I came to Result of Jeam, some people asked me what did you read the Ham Arriors book
I told you, I didn't read this book
But, back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
After that my experience was very good .
I thought, if I had read this book before Eam, I would have been very beneficial.
I liked many aspects from this book, but, I also saw that there are so many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
Thank you for writing the letter first, student friend from my little one.
Thank you for reading a lot of barriers 2-3 times
What you said is that if I get out at the time of the new dedition, I must try to write some things for the parents, Teachers
From all the students of the country, Teachers, I urge the parents, that you, tell me your experiences, your suggestions about aspects connected to the stress ree Yeam.
I must study her
I'll think about it and I'll try to write what I feel better in my own words, in my own way, and if your suggestions come more, then my new discussion will also be confirmed.
So I will wait for your thoughts .
I thank our little friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tyang once again
My dear countrymen, you know about the busy programs of the Prime Minister of the country through TV, through newspapers, also discuss busyness
But, you don't even know I'm a common man like you
If someone else was on this occasion, he would have been disappointed and disappointed, but, his face did not me, but he laughed at everyone's faces with his words.
In their humility, simplicity and truth sense, everyone got convinced to see the form of sportsman spirit in Letter and Spirit.
The audience present there welcomed them warmly .
Even after losing in a tough collision, he praised his rival Nadal and gave evidence to the sportsman spirit alive.
On the other hand, Champion Nadal also praised the game of Unil.
The joy of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner were worth seeing .
The thinking of our ancestors is really capable of
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janati Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when a person contains qualification and humility together, then, whose heart can not win
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of the people around the world
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I'm going to do now, I'm doing straight to your good.
It is very difficult to stop it later .
But, if we wake up initially and stop him, a lot can be saved.
In this sense, I think, today, especially my youth I must talk to something
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health, and leaving his addiction also becomes very difficult
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure increases very much for people who consume tobacco
Everybody says that
The intoxication of tobacco is caused by nicotine present in it .
Its consumption in adolescence also affects the development of brain .
But, today, I want to talk to you, on a new topic
You know, recently restricted to e-cigarette in India
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic device different from normal citizen
While we all understand the dangers of normalcigarettes, there's a wrong idea about e-cigarette.
This misconception has been spread that there is no danger from e-cigarette
They don't smoke any member of the family, that's what they try, that's not smoking.
They know that smoking causes huge loss to the body from tobacco
The drinker knows , and the seer knows .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different
There is not so much awareness among people about E-Cigarette
They are completely unaware of its danger and because of this sometimes e-cigarette secretly enters the house.
Our youth goes on the path of waste, unknowingly.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in the e-cigarette, which has a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it goes through smell.
In such a situation, many teenagers and youths are seen roaming around in their office, in their office, in their pocket, sometimes in their hands and sometimes they become victims of it.
Young generation is the future of the country
E-Cigarette has been banned so that this new method of intoxication does not destroy our young country
Children's life will not be wasted by not roaming the dreams of every family
These diseases, do not store these habits in society
I urge you all to leave the busyness of tobacco, and don't make any misunderstanding about e-cigarette.
Let us all build a healthy India together .
You get it ID
Do you remember India
India means a little here that if we go to Gym for two-two hours in the morning and evening, then it'll happen.
This is our Bharatmata, this is our country, multiple Vasundhara
Many human gems have come out of this earth
India-year has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, working-ground
And these are those people who have consumed themselves, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great Vibhuti is being honored in Vetican City on October 13
It is a matter of pride for every Indian, that Pope Francis will declare Mary Thresia as a saint on October 13.
Sister Mary Thressia has done the work of humanity in his young lifetime of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
From the field of social service and education, he had a unique attachment
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and remained in this mission forever.
I once again paid homage to Sister Mary Thresia and I congratulate the people of India especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, not only India today, it is a matter of pride for the whole world, that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, along with this, 130 million countrymen have resolved to be free from Single See Plastique.
In the direction of environmental protection, seeing the kind of leadership India has taken in the whole world, today the eyes of all countries are towards India
I'm sure you'll all be going to be part of the campaign to get rid of Single se plastic on October 2.
People are contributing to this campaign in their own way.
But, a young man from our own country, has launched a very unique campaign
I noticed his work, so I tried to understand his new experiment by talking to him on the phone.
Maybe, these things of their people and people of the country also came to work
Shriman Riputman Belvi ji is doing a unique effort they do plogging
When I heard the first time the polling word was also new to me
In foreign countries , maybe these words have been used in some quantity .
But, in India, Republic Belvi has propagated it very much
Let ' s talk to them .
I congratulate you very much and the sports ministry is also II on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Lord Bapu .
Two kilometers of polling on October 2, these programs will be held across the country
How should this program be done, what happens in the program, we have heard from the experience of Republic
We shall not only take care of our health , but also protect our mother ' s health .
With this campaign, awareness is increasing in people as well as cleanliness
I believe that 130 million countrymen will take one step in this direction, then their India will move 130 million steps forward towards the liberation of single world plastic.
Repubman ji, once again, thank you very much
And congratulate you, your team, and for this new imagination, very much from me
want to move your life into the country .
One thing likes to remember a little in Advanced
Well, I'll tell him in detail in the next mind, but today I'm saying so you get an opportunity to prepare.
You remember, on October 31, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary
So you just start preparing
I'll talk in detail but it's time now, some people can start proctise, some plans can also
My dear countrymen, you will remember, on August 15, I told the Red Fort that you go to 15 places in India by 2022
If at least 15 places and that can happen, then make a night, two night stay program
You see Hindustan, understand, experience
How many varieties do we have
And when they come on holidays in Diwali festival, people go and so I will again request you to visit any 15 such places in India.
Today our rank is forty and five years ago our rank was at number 65 , i . e . in a way we ' ve put a lot of big jumps
If we try more then 75 years of independence, we will make our place in the world's main places in tourism.
Also see, in the days of Diwali, there will be no loss of any person from firecrackers, etc.
Whatever objection should be taken for this, you must take a precaution
Come on
Thank you
Talk of mind , November 2017
Can you imagine how hard he must have worked to make the Constitution of his country full of diversity
Konkan coastline, where there was an important role of the sea, under the state of Shivaji Maharaj, many colonies connected to Shivaji Maharaj, such as Indus Durg, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either situated on the seashores, the responsibility of the security of these arts was to serve Maratha nine-seas, the construction of big ships and small boats in Maratha Navi was very skilled in attacking and defending any enemy and we were very capable of discussing and remembering Maratha, how can we remember
Thinking is also afraid of not being soil, neither trees and plants will grow, where will human life be possible
Where will the organism be possible
With all kinds of scientific methods, it has been proved that the use of urea more than requirement of land and mother is a serious loss, the farmer is the son of the earth, how can the farmer see the earth and mother ill
Time is expected, to resume the relations of this mother and son once again, can our farmers, sons of our land, our children of our land determine whether they use as much urea in their field today, 2022, when there will be 75 years of independence, half of the use will stop
The person of North-India will not know what is in South-India
The person of West-India will not know what is in East India
If our country is full of varieties, Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, see them in their words, once it comes to the fact that when they visited India, they got a new inspiration to see India and to live for it, all these great men tried to understand India in the beginning of their work. Have we tried to live in our own self, we tried to live India, different states of our country, different communities, groups, groups, their families, their families, their families, their families, their families, their families, their families, their families, their recognition, understand their recognition, understanding as one
Can you place on IncredibleIndia (Hash Tag incredibleIndia)
You see, if all the people of a state tell this, then I will say in the government that they should scrutinize him and create publicity on what seven things have come from every state, i.e., how to promote tourism from the public's expressions
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On one hand , the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand , when news of violence comes from any corner of India , it is natural for the country to worry .
This is our country of Buddha and Gandhi, Sardar Patel's country that gives life to the unity of the country
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted public life and valuations, non-violence, summit, in our hearts.
non-violence Parmo religion:, we have been listening since childhood, have come to say
I want to convince the countrymen, who take law, who suppress the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, neither will this country ever tolerate or tolerate any government
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to eating, living, wearing.
We see diversity in every activity of life
Even our festivals are also filled with diversity and due to our cultural heritage thousands of years old, see cultural traditions, see social traditions, see historical events, hardly 365 days will be saved in 365 days, while no festival is connected to us
Now you must have seen that all our festivals go according to the journal at the time of nature
There is direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly connected to the farmer, are connected to fishermen
Today I ' m talking about the festivals , so first I ' ll tell you all sweetly .
The festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated tomorrow in Jain society .
In Jain society festival is celebrated in Bhadra month .
The last day of the festival is the day of the festival .
It ' s really a wonderful tradition in itself
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
It is also called a forgiveness festival in a way and on this day each other has a tradition of saying silly words .
In our scriptures , however , the forgiveness of Veerasya Bhushanam , i . e . the forgiveness of the heroes .
Forgiveness is a hero .
We have heard these discussions , and Mahatma Gandhi always said , " Forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person . "
Shakespeare had written in his drama The Merchant of Ennice the significance of forgiveness, Mercy is twenty blast, I too blessed him with that gifts and hem that takes i . e . forgives and whom both have been forgiven , both of them receive the blessings of God
My dear countrymen, these days, in every corner of India, Ganesh Chaturthi's foolishness has started and when Ganesh Chaturthi comes, the public-Ganeshotsav is natural.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and for the last 125 years he had become a symbol of freedom movement .
And after independence, they have become symbols of social education, social-consciousness
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasts for 10 days .
This great Lord is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity
Best wishes to all the countrymen of Ganeshotsav
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala
One of the colorful festivals of India, Onam is a major festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
Onam's festival shows the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival awakens a new glory, new hope, new faith in the minds of people as well as giving message of love and harmony in society.
And now these festivals are also becoming the reason for the attraction of tourism
And I would tell the countrymen that the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or the Durga festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way .
Our and festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners
What we can do in that direction, you should think
A few days later, the festival of Eid-ul-Juha will also be celebrated across the country in the series of these festivals.
Id-ul-uha's very good news to all the countrymen, very good wishes
The festival is a symbol of faith and faith for us, we have to make festivals in new India even a symbol of cleanliness.
In the family life , there are festivals and hygiene .
Preparation of festival means cleanliness
This is not a new thing for us , but it is also necessary to create a social nature .
Public hygiene urged not only in the house, in our entire village, in the entire city, in the whole city, in our state, cleanliness in our country, these festivals should be an incomplete part
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing
These days a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modernised you are, how much modernised, it's all, a trumpet has also started working to know and that's how aware you are about the environment.
In your activities, eco-rendly, evironment-rendly behavior that is against him
In society , if against him , it is considered evil today .
And the result of that today I am seeing that these days even in the Ganeshotsav, Deco-Rindly Ganapati, as if a big campaign has been created.
If you go to You Tube, children are making Ganesh ji in every house, are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil
Various uses are being done in every family
See how big changes have come and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is also full of millions of stunning minds.
Three years ago when the campaign of cleanliness started, it will be three years on October 2.
And, his positive results are coming out
The coverage of toilets has reached around 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation
In the past, there was a lot of floods in Gujarat
A lot of people lost their lives , but when the water was reduced after floods , so much dirt was destroyed everywhere .
At such a time, in the Dhanera of Banaskantha district of Gujarat, workers of Jamiat Ulemaya Hind cleaned the 22 temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
He swept away from himself , and they came out .
The best example of unity for cleanliness, such example of inspiration to everyone, given by all the workers of Jamiat Ulemahind
Trying to dedicate to cleanliness, if it becomes our permanent nature, then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again on October 2, 15-20 days before the Gandhi Jayanti, sanitation was the same service as the water service, this is the Lord service, run a campaign of sanitation.
Make an environment for cleanliness across the country
As you get, wherever you get the opportunity, we find opportunities
But we all add
Consider it as a preparation of Diwali in a way, consider it a preparation for Navaratri in a way, consider Durga Puja preparation
My social media friends can run some creative campaigns and work on the surface of Virtual World, make his inspiration
Pictures and competitions are being organized by the Ministry of Cleanliness, Drinking Water and Sanitation, in which you are contesting the essay, small films are being organized.
In it you can write essays in different languages and there is no limit of age in it, no leg livelimit
You can make Short Film, make your mobile
Can create a 2-3-minute movie which inspires cleanliness
She might be in any lunguage, she might also be silent
You see, what will be the glitter of Gandhi Jayanti on October 2
After this 15-day cleaning campaign, after the sanitation service, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on October 2, how sacred will be the joy within us to pay homage to God Bapu
My dear countrymen, I want to accept the debt of all of you in a particular today
I want to thank you with the deepness of the heart, not because you have been associated with the mind for so long, I want to thank you because I want to accept the loan because with this program of mind, millions of people join every corner of the country.
The number of listeners is in crores, but millions of people ever write me letters, sometimes messages, sometimes the message comes on the phone, I have a big treasure.
To know the minds of the people of the country, it has become a big opportunity for me.
I wait for your messages more than what you wait for .
I ' m relieved because I get to learn something from your point of view
Yeah, yeah, you've ever made such a mistake.
Sometimes some things become part of our habit that we do not think that we miss .
Prime Minister, I'm speaking apna from Poona
I want to tell you about my friend
He always tries to help people but I am surprised to see a habit of him
I once went to mall shopping with him
On a sari, he spent two thousand rupees very comfortably and Rs 450 on Pizza, while the auto that was taken to the mall, kept moving for five rupees for a long time from the auto driver.
Buy vegetables on the way back and save 4-5 rupees by turning back on every vegetable
I feel very bad
You must tell about your mind .
Now after listening to these phone calls, I'm sure you must have been shocked, even surveillance and maybe have decided in mind not to make such a mistake from the front.
Do you not think when we come to sell some goods around our house, a ferry comes, we belong to a small shopkeeper, vegetable sellers, sometimes with auto-rickshaws, whenever we come with a hard worker, we start breaking the emotion from it, do not let loose it, do not reduce two rupees, reduce five rupees
And we don't even see what we've written in the bill, if we go to eat in a big restaurant, give money from the bush.
Not only this, go to buy saris in shorom, do not have any foolishness but if your relationship comes from any poor, they do not live without foolishness.
What would happen to the poor mind , you have ever thought it
Two rupees five does not make any difference in your life but how deep does this tiny habit of your mind have to push his mind
Madam, I thank you for giving me a message by calling so much heart touching phone.
I am sure my countrymen will surely leave the habit of doing this with evil .
My beloved young companion celebrates the entire country as a national sports day on August 29
This is the birth day of great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji .
His contribution to Hockey was incomparable
I'm reminding that I want the new generation of our country, connected to the game
Sports become part of our life
If we are young nations in the world , we must also look into this sports ground .
Sports i.e. physical itness, mental alternates, personality management I understand what more than that
Sports is a very big herb of heart mixing in a way .
The young generation of our country came forward in the sports world and today in the composer's age, I would like to ascertain that playing is more important than life, play-stattion.
Play a game but look out in the field and sometimes working with Coutball
Play crickets on computer but playing crickets below the sky in the open field is something else
There was a time when the family kids went out , the mother first asked when you would come back
Today the condition is that when the children come home , they either see cartoon ilms in a corner , either stick to the mobile gaume and then the mother has to scream and say when you will go out .
There is news of happiness for our young people that IDA in India is going to be organized from 6 to 28 October 17 World Cup
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests coming from the world, welcome the festival of sports, enjoy the game, create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today , I want to shave my mind with the people of the country who have suffered a very touching event last week
I got a chance to meet some daughters of a very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Sometimes spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will spend in water
Our six daughters with courage between the waves of the sea and this is happening the first thing in the world
Who will be Hindustani who do not deny our daughters
I salute the tongue of these daughters and I have told them to share their experiences with the whole country
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendramodi App so that you can read him because this is a brave story in a way, the story of selfishness and I will be happy to bring these daughters to you.
My daughters have great blessings, great blessings
My dear countrymen, we celebrate all teachers' day on September 5
Former President of our country is the birthday of Dr . Radhakrishnan ji .
He was president but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I bow down to them , great scientist Albert Einstein said I
It is the Supreme Court of the teacher to take pleasure in Creative Expression and Knowledge. It is the most important quality of a teacher to enjoy creative sentiment and knowledge among his students.
This time , when we celebrate teacher days , can we all resolve together

If we do collective efforts , we will play a very big role in the nation ' s transformation
Let's take the text to transform this mantra
Pranam Prime Minister
My name is Doctor Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai city and I work for the Indian Reservation Center of Howard niversity
My dear countrymen, Prime Minister Jan-Dhan Yojana Inclusion, it has been a matter of discussion of Pandits of the economic world not only in India.
On August 28, 2014, taking a dream in the mind, started this campaign
On August 28, the campaign for this Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
30 million new families are connected with it, bank account has opened
This is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today I have a very big solution that my poor brother, sitting on that last end of the three years, has become part of the country's economy, his habit has changed, he has started coming to the bank, he has started saving money, he is feeling the security of money.
Sometimes money lives in hand, lives in the pocket, is in the house, then you want to spend fruitfully
If you have to do some good work in the coming days, money will work
About 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks through our poor people in the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana
It's a bad saving, it's his power in the coming days.
And with the Prime Minister Jan-Dhan Yojana, whose account opens, he also got the benefit of insurance
Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Insurance Scheme, Prime Minister's Security Insurance Scheme, Rs one rupee, 30 rupees a very minor premium today creates a new faith in the lives of the poor
In many families, due to a rupee beef, when a poor man got a crisis, the family chief's life ended, he got two lakh rupees in a few days
Prime Minister's Currency Scheme, Start P scheme, Stand P scheme is Dalit, adivasi, a woman, a young man, a young man who has been reading and writing, standing on his feet, millions of young people from the Prime Minister's Currency Scheme, without any guarantee money from banks, and he himself stands on his feet Not only, everyone has also tried to provide employment to one or two.
Today is not so much time but I will surely tell the people of Bank that he should upload him on My Gov.in, people read, people will get inspiration from him that any plan, how transformation comes in the life of the person, how new energy fills, how new faith comes in front of me, hundreds of examples
I ' ll do my best to reach you and there ' s an inspiring event that the people of the media can also take advantage of it .
They can also inspire the new generation by introducing such people
Man's mind is such that rainy season is a very pleasant time for mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature becomes happy at the arrival of every rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a vicious form, it shows how big it is to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, leads us, but sometimes natural disasters such as floods, earthquake, its horrific form, destroys a lot.
The changes in changing weather and environment are also happening to be a big negative impact.
For the past few days, natural disaster has suffered due to some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal, due to excessive rainfall.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief work is being done at a wider level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching.
State governments are also making a lot of efforts to help flood victims in their own way.
Social organizations, cultural organizations, civilians working with service are also making a lot of efforts to help people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Indian government, there are soldiers of the army, people of the air force, people of the NCR, there are paramilitory forces, everyone joins the life to serve the disaster victims at such times.
And 247 controll from helpline number 1078 is constantly working to deal with the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government machinery was prepared by drilling the mock at the maximum places before the rainy season.
NCR teams were installed.
Slowly, we also made nature that if we can also create our activities according to the weather forecast, then we can escape from the loss.
Whenever I prepare for the matter of mind, I am seeing, citizens of more country than me prepare.
This time, so many letters have come about GST, so many phone calls have come and still people express happiness about GST, also express curiosity.
A phone call I also tell you: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Netu Garg from Gurgaon.
I listened to your hearted accountants Day's speech and was very impressed.
Similarly, on the date of today in our country, the Goods and Services Tax-GST started.
Can you tell whether the result is coming a month later or not as the government had epected
I would like to listen to your ideas about it, thank you.
The GST applies is almost a month and its benefits are starting to appear.
And I am very satisfactory, happy, when someone writes to me a letter and says how things have been cheaper because of GST.
If North-ast, in remote mountains, a person living in the forests writes a letter that initially feared what is not known but now when I started learning and understanding in it, I think, it has already become more easier.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers' trust towards businessman has started increasing.
Now I was seeing how GST's impacture was on Transport and Logistics sector.
How now the movement of trucks has increased
How is the time decreasing to distance
Whighways have clutter ree.
Pollution has also decreased due to the speed of trucks.
The goods are also reaching very early.
This facility is only, but economic speed also gets stronger.
Due to the first different tax struggle, the maximum resources of the transport andlogistic sector used to pay the public management and he had to make his new warehouses within every state.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Ta, has actually created a very positive effect on our economy and in very short time.
With the speed that has been smooth transition, the fast immigration has taken place, new registrations have created a new faith in the whole country.
And sometimes the Pandits of the economy, the Pandits of Management, the Technology, will definitely write the use of GST of India as a model in front of the world.
There will be a case state for many universities in the world.
Because with such a big challenge and the involvingment of millions of people on such a large scale, it is a huge height of success in itself.
The world must study it.
And GST has implemented, all states have a partnership in it, all states have the responsibility.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center unanimously.
And the result of that is that every government has the same priority that there is no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I congratulate all the ministries engaged in this work, all the departments, all the issues of the central and state government with heart.
GST is an excellent example of the success of India's collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a form, it is an economy that strengthens the culture of a new honesty.
There is also a campaign for social reform in a way.
I once again simplified the Koti-Koti countrymen to make such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
Simultaneously we have heard this from childhood and the reason for this is August 1, 1920 non-cooperation movement started.
On August 9, 1942 quit India, the movement started, which is known as August Revolution and the country was freed on August 15, 1947.
In a way, in August, many incidents are specially associated with freedom struggle.
But very few people know that leaving India, this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the countrymen who continued to join, struggled, struggled, struggled, the pages of history are our inspiration to build a grand India.
Our freedom fighters have sacrificed sacrifices, penance, sacrifices, what can be a great motivation from it.
Leave India's movement was an important struggle for Indian independence movement.
This movement had resolved the whole country to get rid of the British-Raj.
This was the time when Indian public opinion in protest against British power, in every corner of India, villages, cities, cities, cities, cities, universities, poor, rich, rich, everybody mixing shoulders and shoulders and shoulders became part of the movement.
Jan-Akrosh was on its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were blaming their lives in the struggle with the mantra of death.
Millions of young people of the country had left their studies, left books.
Excluding non-cooperation movement and India, two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi are seen in 1920 and 1942.
The form of non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity increased so much that the great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra or the mantra of death.
There was public support behind all this success, people were able, people were conscious, people were conscious.
The whole country was fighting one.
And I sometimes think, if you see the pages of history by adding a little, then the first freedom struggle of India happened in 1857.
The freedom struggle started from 1857 continued every moment in any corner of the country till 1942.
This long period created a glimpse of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone got committed to doing something.
The generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People came, joined, went, went new, new coupled, and the country continued to try every moment to overthrow the British elite.
This labour from 1857 to 1942 created a situation that 1942 reached its peak border and left India so that within 5 years, the British had to go to 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached the public.
And from 1942 to 1947, five years became such a people, with the resolve, the country became the reason for providing health to the country with success as a five decisive year of prosperity.
These were five years decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
Governments came - Yes
Arrangements were made, changed, flourished, increased.
Everyone tried their own way to free the country from problems.
Successes were also found.
The expectations also awakened.
Like 1942 to 1947, there were a decisive five years of Siddhi's resolve.
I am seeing that from 2017 to 2022 resolution, a five-year break of Siddhi and a five-year break has come out.
On August 15, 2017, we celebrate as a resolution festival and when independence is 75 years in 2022, we will continue to convert that resolve into proverb.
There are millions of resolutions.
Try to fulfil millions of resolutions.
So, like 1942 to 1947, five years became decisive for the country, they can become decisive for the future of India from five years 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, the country will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then we all have to take a strong resolution today.
2017 is to make a year of our resolve.
This is the August month we have to join with the resolution and we have to resolve.
Let's run a glory of Siddhi from the resolution from August 9 in August this month.
A resolution that we will prove in the next 5 years.
Young organizations, students organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
Can reveal new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can happen to me as a person
Let us join on the festival of this resolution.
Using Technology, Video, Post, Blog, Archive, New-new Lidea came with all these things.
Change this campaign into a public movement.
This is an attempt to connect young people with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I'm sure you must propagate, spread it.
As my beloved countrymen, on August 15, as the country's principal servant, I get an opportunity to communicate with the country from the Red Cross.
I'm just a simple person, there he doesn't speak a person.
The voice of hundred and fifty million countrymen from the red kiss goes on.
Attempts are made to word their dreams and I am happy that every corner of the country consistently on August 15 for the last 3 years, I get suggestions what should I say on August 15
This time too, I'll invite you, either on my gov, send your thoughts to me on the NarendramodiApp.
I read it myself and I will try to reveal it in whatever time I have on August 15.
For the last three times, I have received a complaint in my 15 August speeches that my speech is slightly long.
I've tried to make rules for me at least 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know, I can't.
But I intend to try this time how to do my speech
Let's see, success does not get it.
I want to talk to the countrymen, another thing today.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never decrease it.
Our festival, our festival, that is not the only occasion of happiness and love.
Our festival, our festival is also a campaign for social reform.
And in these festivals, a natural pleasure is also added.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in family, brotherhood in society.
Adds people and society.
A simple journey from the person to the settlement runs.
It becomes an opportunity to go from Akhn to Vyam.
As far as the economy is concerned, Rakhi starts making rakhis in small domestic industries in hundreds of families several months ago.
From Khadi to silk threads, how many rakhis and nowadays people love homemade rakhis more.
Rakhi-making, rakhi-saking, sweet thousands of thousands of rupees are associated with a festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, the family runs from this.
We burn the lamp in Deepawali, just that light is, it is not the same, it is just the festival, the house is adorned, it is not so.
His direct relation is with those poor families who have given small soil.
But today when I talk about the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals, I will also want to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think the countrymen are more aware than me, more active.
For the past one month, aware citizens have written letters to me for the environment.
And they have urged you to tell Deco-Rindly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi before time so that people have planned on the choice of Ganesh of soil.
I am grateful to such aware citizens first.
They have urged me to say on this subject before time.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
For a year and a half-and-a-half million countrymen Lokmanya Tilak ji started public Ganeshotsav for the rites of collectivity, for the basic spirit of society and awareness of society.
We once again recall the contribution of Ganeshotsav in this year, discuss the discussions, remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I ' ve said very quickly
I'm sure you all will join me and the advantage will be that our poor artisans who are poor artists who make idols will get employment, the poor will fill the stomach.
I give good wishes to all the people of the country for many festivals, for festivals, for the festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching that there is a field of education, there is economic sector, there is a social sector, playing, our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, getting new heights.
We are proud of our daughters, our countrymen are getting frustrated.
In the past, our daughters performed greatly in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I liked to talk to them very much, but I was feeling that the Lord could not win the up, it was a big burden on them.
He had pressure on his face, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave a different assessment to me.
I said, nowadays the time of media is such that expectations are increased so much, so much is increased and when failure is not received, it also changes in resentment.
We have seen many such games that if India's players fail, then the country's ghost breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something like this, write such things, there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time that when our daughters could not be successful in the world cup, then 100 million people took the defeat on their shoulders.
Not only did the burden fall on those daughters, but they praised what these daughters did, they were proud of them.
I see it a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you see, such lucky luck has just got you people, you get out of your mind that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won 20 million countrymen.
My dear countrymen, once again I remind the August revolution, once again on 9th August, once again I'm reminding you on August 15, once again, 2022, 75 years of independence.
Get every countrymen resolved, prepare a 5-year rad-map to prove every countrymen's resolve.
We all have to reach the country on new heights, reach and reach.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
The fate of the country, the future will be better, move forward with this faith.
Changing weather
This time the heat was too much
But it is better that the rain is moving forward on its footsteps .
In many parts of the country the weather has become pleasant with rains .
After the rain, cold winds have experienced relief from the heat of the past.
And we all have seen that there is so much confusion in life, as much stress as it is, personal life, public life, rain arrival changes our mindset.
Today Lord Jagannath ji's chariot journey celebrates many parts of the country with great reverence and gladness .
Now in some parts of the world , Lord Jagannath ji ' s Rath Yatra is celebrated .
and the country is closely connected with Lord Jagannath .
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor
And very few people will know, there's a word in English language and that means, such a grand chariot that nobody can stop
And in the dictionary meaning of this juggernaut also it is found that this word has started with the chariot of Jagannatha .
And so we can understand how the world has also accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way .
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath , I give good wishes to all the people of the country and also salute Lord Jagannath in the shrines of the Lord .
This is also the characteristic of India's diversity, India's diversity is also India's power
The Holy Month of Ramadan is celebrated with a holy spirit in worship .
Now is the festival of Eid .
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr all wishes from me to the greatest of Eid
Ramadan is the month of Punya Dan, the month of breadth of happiness and the happiness that breeds, the happiness increases
Come, let us all together with these holy festivals to divide the treasures of happiness, move forward the country
In this holy month of Ramadan , a major inspiring incident of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me .
About three and a half thousand our Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village, in a way more population belongs to the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
The villagers decided to build toilets in this penance .
And in this private toilet , the government also provides assistance , and the amount of assistance is given to them about 17 lakh rupees .
These 17 lakhs of rupees you spend for other facilities of the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for reversing this holy occasion of Ramadan in the occasion of goodwill of the society .
We know that three states in our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, they have already been declared free from open defecation.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also declared this week
I express special gratitude to the administration of these five states, governance and public-janadhan to fulfil this work.
We know well that in the life of the person, something good in the life of the society, then it has to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if he has to fix it, he has to try to be very aware for a long time.
Then go and change the habit of the body, the mind
Thus is the matter of cleanliness .
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone has to draw attention .
Repeated reminding of good inspirational events
And I am happy that sanitation today is not a government program
This is becoming an aggression of public society, public opinion
And when people sitting in governance also go ahead with this work, how much power increases
In the past, a very best event came to me, which I would like to tell you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration there took a big job from the public participation .
100 hours of non stop campaign
And what was the goal
To make ten thousand domestic toilets in 71 gram panchayats in one hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that public-janardan and the government successfully completed the work of making ten thousand toilets in 100 hours together.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district that you have presented a great motivational example while performing the work.
NarendramodiApp comes on, comes on My Gov.in, comes from chits, comes on the sky
Sriman Prakash Tripathi reminded the Emergency that on 25th June he presented as a period of time in the history of democracy .
This awareness of Prakash Tripathi ji's democracy is commendable and democracy is a system, it is not so, it is also a ritual I
Democracy needs eternal awareness , and therefore , the things that hurt democracy have to be remembered , and it has to move forward in the direction of good things of democracy .
1975 - June 25 - That was such dark night, which no democracy lover can forget
No Indian can forget UIDE
In a way, the country was converted into prison.
The anti-sword was buried UIDE
I had locked dignitaries of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan in jail
The judicial system also could not escape the shadow of that horrific form of emergency.
The newspapers were completely disabled .
The lovers of democracy fought a big fight and a country like India, such a huge country, when the opportunity was received, how democracy is spread in the rage of the people of India, through the election I performed that power.
We have to empower this legacy more
My dear countrymen, every Hindustani is feeling the pride of raising the head in the world today.
June 21, 2017 - The whole world became yoga
From the water to the mountain, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this I
It is not that yoga was not done earlier, but today when yoga has been tied in the thread of yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world made this opportunity of Yoga its opportunity
In China, the Great All of Hina, people exercised yoga on it, then people on the Orland Detage Site Machu Pichu in Peru, 2400 meters above the sea level
In the shadow of the FIL tower in France , people used ID
The programs were held at 70 places in small places like Singapore and they have launched a campaign throughout the week.
NO extracts 10 stamps of International Yoga Day
In N Deduarter, Coga session with Coga Masters was organized I
NK Sta, the world's diplomats everyone shared in it I
This time again Yoga also worked as World Record
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad together made a new world record
I also got an opportunity to join the programme in Lucknow .
But for the first time I got the good fortune of doing yoga in the rain
Our soldiers, where Minus 20, 25, 40 degree temperates, do yoga in Siachen too
TBP, RP, IS, everyone has made Yoga as part of their duty
On this yoga day, I had said that three generations, because it was the third international yoga day, then I had said that three generations of the family together, show their photographs.
Some T Channell also carried forward this thing
Sir, I have a question that in Resently Kerala we had heard you that the future as a git we give, instead of kind of good boxes should give us as a memento
You started this thing in Gujarat even during your tenure, sir, but now in recent days we are not getting to see this excess
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a tradition in the government that we would not give Bouet, Book, either hand and hand, handkerchie would welcome him.
And khadi's handkerchie, so that khadi can also be encouraged
As long as I was in Gujarat, we had become the habit of all, but after coming here my habit was lost.
But he went to Kerala, once again he became aware
And I ' ve just started giving information below the government .
We can also gradually create a nature
And the age of Bouet is very low .
Once we took it, then leave it
But if books, then becomes part of the house in a way, becomes part of the family
And when I am saying this , how historical value of such things is
When I went last year, Britan's ueen, ueen Liabeth invited me to eat in London.
was a maternal environment
He also did food with great love, but later he showed me a little khadi in emotional voice and a handkerchie sown with smoke and he was shine in his eyes, he said that when I was married, this handkerchie Mahatma Gandhi sent me to the wedding as a good wish
How many years have passed, but ueen Liabeth has kept this handkerchie handled by Mahatma Gandhi
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life, became part of his history
I believe these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, then there is also a victim of criticism.
But despite this, such things should continue, should continue to try
Now I can't say I'll go somewhere and get a boote, I'll refuse him, I can't do that.
But still there will be criticism, but talk will continue, then there will be gradually improvement
My dear countrymen, as prime ministers, have many types of work
The files are drowned, but I have developed a habit for me that I read some letters daily from the letters that come to me and because of that I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of chits come, different types of people write chits
These days I got an opportunity to read a letter, I think I must tell you
In the far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a Chusevie Arulmozhi Sarananan of Madurai - he sent me a letter
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economical activity in the care of children's education in my family, then the family would have a little financial help.
So I started some work from the money scheme, taking money from the bank and bringing some goods from the market to supplies
In such a situation I noticed that the Government of India has created a system called Government -MarketPlace
So I also registered myself in it, I want to tell the people of the country, if you get a chance, then I
is a big new type of system .
And then he has to order .
So those who registry inside the GM, all the departments of the government keep watching him
Due to lack of intermediaries things are found very cheap
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has made all the registry of the goods he can give on this website of the government.
And funny is that the letter they wrote to me is great interesting.
This is Empoverment
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship
Perhaps Arulmozhi ji did not write a letter to me, then I would not have even noticed that a housewife is working a little far away from the arrangement of the GM, his goods can be bought to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the power of the nation .
There is also transparency in it, it also has empoverment, it also has entrepreneurship.
I would sure that those who want to sell their goods to the government in this way add more than that
I believe Minimum Government and Maimum Governance are the best example of this and what its goal is Minimum Express and Maimum Face, Education and Transparency
My dear countrymen, on one side we proud of yoga, and on the other side we can also proud of our principles in Space Science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the earth associated with yoga, then our dreams are also to cross those horizons of far-flung heavens.
In the past, India has shown a lot in sports and science too.
Today India is waved not only on earth but also in space.
Two days ago, ISR launched 30 Nano satellites with Cartosat-2 Series Stellite
And these satellites include France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America - almost 14 such countries
And this nano satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of farming, in the work of peasantry, in regard to natural disaster.
And this is the most weighty healthy style in what India has so far done.
And the news of our country had compared with its elephant weight, so you can imagine how big work our scientists have done in the field of space
On June 19, a thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed
You all know that when we successfully made the place in the forbeit for Mars mission, this entire mission was for a 6-month period
A thousand days to be completed within our scientific journey, there is an important stop inside our space journey
Even in the spots these days we ' re seeing that the trend of our youth is increasing
Now it has started to be seen that along with studies, our youth generations have started showing their future in sports and due to our players, due to their pursuit, the name of the country is also illuminated.
Recently India ' s badminton player Kidambi Shrikant has increased the value of the country by winning in Indonesia Open
I congratulate him and his coach for this achievement .
A few days ago, I got an opportunity to join the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Athlete P. T. Usha ji's sha school of Athletics.
The more we'll promote the game, the sports, also brings the sports, sportsman spirit
Sports plays a very important role in the development of personality .
The game is very important in the overall personality devolution
There is no shortage of talents in the country
If children are interested in sports in our family, then they should give opportunity
Everyone should have dreams for the next limpic
Then once my loved countrymen, rainy season, the atmosphere of continuous festivals, in a way the experience of this period is new
I ' ll once again talk to you all while talking about the next mind .
We will hardly forget this year's heat.
But the rain is waiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramadan has started.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramadan, I give hearty best wishes to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community, this holy month.
This is a country which is also people who believe in God and people who deny God, idol worshipers and protesters of idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship system, every kind of tradition, we have done the art of living together.
And finally religion, sect, ideology, tradition, give us this message of peace, unity and goodwill.
It will be helpful in pursuing this path of peace, unity and goodwill of Ramzan's holy month.
I once again wish everyone.
I'm glad a lot of people gave me the feedback.
Individually everyone showed me the enthusiasm to tell my point.
I have not read everything, I have not even heard everyone's message, so many things have come.
But, whatever I saw from the simple sight, someone has tried to learn music, someone is trying to hand over the new instrument, some people are trying to learn new things using you tube, trying to learn new language.
Some people are learning cooking, learning some dances, learning some ड्राmas, some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing, living, understanding nature is trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle has to be fought to get freedom, how much sacrifice has to be given, how many freedom fighters spent years in jails.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved a lot at a very young age, so I am requesting you to give some message to the generation of today.
I am happy that young people are interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters, people who sacrifice for this country.
Many years ago I went to Andaman Nicobar.
Cellular went to see the jail.
Today Veer Savarkar ji's birth is Jayanti.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a Mazi-born book in jail.
Poems used to write, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What of the tortures of freedom fighters would have suffered.
When I read a book that was born of Savarkar ji, and from that I got inspiration to see the cellular jail.
There's a lift and sound show too program, he's very inspiring.
There was no such state in India, there will be no language speaker of India, who should not be spent in the jail of Andaman, in this cellular jail, in the jail of Andaman, facing black water sentence for freedom.
Every language speaker, every province, every generation of people had suffered the torture. Today Veer Savarkar ji's birth is Jayanti.
I will surely tell the younger generation of the country how many people suffered the torture of what we have received, if we go to cellular jail, why was black water called
My dear countrymen, June 5, is the first Monday of the month.
Connect to Nature means - nurturing the better planet.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhiji used to say many times, "Ne must car about a world one will not see" i.e. we will not see the world, our duty is to worry about it too, we also listen to it."
Have come very tired, open the room windows, open the doors, take the breath of fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
When the body is formed from the punch Mahabharats, when they come in contact with those punch Mahabharats, then a new consciousness appears in our body, a new energy appears.
All of us have experienced this, but we do not register him, we do not add him to a thread, in a formula.
After this, you must see that whenever you come in contact with natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore, the global campaign to join the nature of June 5 should also be our own campaign.
Our ancestors protected the environment, we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect our coming generations will get benefits.
Earth and environment are considered to be the origin of power in Vedas.
And Atharvaveda is completely, in a way the largest guide of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
Our motherland has been said here: Sons are important separates:
The Vedas say that the fulfilment in us is due to our earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, then one thing is evident that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the achievement of knowledge and his Maha-Parinirvana, was under the three trees.
These days I keep coming from the states.
In almost all the states, a huge campaign of tree plantation runs as soon as the rain comes.
Plants are planted in crores of rupees.
School children are also added, social-service organizations join, connect NGOs, the government itself takes initiative.
We also encourage this work of tree plantation in this year, contribute this time.
My dear countrymen, June 21, now the world has become the day to go on June 21.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
In very short time, this World Yoga Day of June 21 has failed in every corner, connecting people.
On one hand, many powers of scattering in the world are showing their distorted face, in such a time the world has a very big contribution to India.
Through yoga, we have added the world to a formula.
Like yoga, body, mind, intelligence and soul add, yoga is adding to the world today.
Due to lifestyle today, due to increased responsibility, it is becoming difficult to live free life from stress.
And even at the young age, this situation has reached.
Taking non-availability medicines and passing day, Yoga's role is important to live a stress-free life in such a clock.
Yoga is the Guarantee of both Welness and Eitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
From the mind, from mind, from the body, from ideas, from the ideas, how a interpretation of health from conduct - if that interpretation is to be experienced then it is possible through yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments of the world about Yoga Day, all the leaders.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga, some rewards have been announced.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third international yoga day and appeal to me that this time three generations of the same family together on the third international yoga day.
Dad-in-law or grandfather, parents, son-daughter, three generations together and upload his picture.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be such a good coincidence that yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel as if we had launched a dagger campaign with Salie and a very interesting experience.
This picture of three generations will surely wake up the picture for the country and the world.
You must be on the NarendramodiApp, three generations on My Gov, wherever you do yoga, the three generations of people together send me a picture.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be this picture, which will be the guarantee of tomorrow.
I'll invite you all.
We have nearly three weeks for International Yoga Day.
You also propagate the subject of yoga for three weeks, spread it, add people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive health care.
I'm invited to join you all.
This phone call will also bring you to mind: Pranam Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Modi ji T. and today I always see in social media, wherever you go, people of that place pay special attention to cleanliness.
On the call of Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
There is awareness about cleanliness in bigger, children too.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, sticking.
There the government machinery works for cleaning, but these days even in society, there is a celebration of cleanliness.
Five days before going to me, seven days before, ten days before, there are a lot of cleaning programs.
The media also gives him a big priority, now I went to Kutch a few days ago in Gujarat.
There was a very big cleaning campaign.
I also did not see it by adding it.
But when these phone calls came, I also started thinking and I saw that yes this thing is correct.
You can imagine how much I am enjoying, knowing how and how the country is doing these things in a good way.
What will be the pleasure of me that cleanliness has also been added to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the Prime Minister's welcome will be the habit of getting ready, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is enjoyable for any cleanliness and love in itself, inspiring.
I congratulate all those who emphasize this cleanliness work.
Somebody gave me a suggestion.
Well, that's a funny suggestion.
I don't know, I can't do that.
Modi ji now while deciding the migration, whatever migration you ask, tell them that if I want to call, then how will the level of cleanliness be
On the basis of how many tons of garbage and garbage you will meet me I will decide my migration.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big humanity will be done.
One thing I would like to say that we don't believe it's garbage, it's wealth, it's a resort.
Don't just look at it as a carbage.
Once we start accepting this garbage and waste, many new methods of Wast management will come in front of us.
With the help of state governments, the Indian government has decided to launch a major important campaign of West Management through the help of the people of the cities.
On June 5, around 4 thousand cities of the country on World Environment Day, solid waste, lived waste are going to be available to collect it.
Two types of dollars will be available, one green colour, the second blow colour.
Like the whale of kitchen, the peels of vegetables, the remaining food, the peels of eggs, the leaves of trees and plants etc. are all wet waste and put it in green dolls.
All these things are that work in the field, if the color of the field is green, so much remember, then what to put in green trash will be remembered.
Today I have to recognise one thing with pride - if a person is also in mind, then how big a mass movement can stand.
The work of cleanliness is similar.
And the way in which he added people of all the regions and converted them into the mass movement, this is an inspiring example in itself.
Regarding Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Riyasi block of Jammu and Kashmir. I was told that Riyasi block Open Defection Ree (free of defecation) has happened.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that this whole movement has been the most loaded - the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out the torch travels to facilitate awareness, he inspired the people of the house-to-house, street.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the month, continuous news, TV Channel, social media, the current government's 3-year account is going on.
I see all this process as very healthy signals.
This 3-year tenure has been done on every criterion.
People from every section of the society have done his nalysis.
And there is a best process in democracy.
And I believe that governments should be accountable in democracy, public and public should give account of their work.
I thank all those people who took time and discussed the depth of our work, somewhere appreciated, some support came, some earnings were removed, I understand the importance of all these things.
Whether it is good, less good, bad, whatever it is, it is to learn from it and move forward with it.
Constructive criticism strengthens democracy.
For an aware nation, for a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, the effect of everything good is on me as it is on the mind of any common citizen.
Someone sees him as a dialogue on one side, some people also comment on him politically. But after such a long time I feel, when I started talking about the mind, I did not even think.
It seems as if I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk home.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me these things by writing.
I am thankful to President, Vice President, Speaker of the Vice President, that he took out time and the people sitting in such a senior position gave this importance to the mind.
In a way, gave a new dimension to the mind of yourself.
When some of our friends were working on the book of this mind, they also discussed with me.
Abu is known as a artisat Akbar Sahib living in Dhabi. Akabar Saheb proposed from the front that the topics discussed in the matter of mind, they want to prepare his sketch through their art and without any rupee, Akabar Saheb gave the form of art to the mind.
I'm grateful to Akbar Sahib.
By the time I meet my dear countrymen, the next time, the rain has come in every corner of the country, the weather will change, the results of the examinations will have come, the new education will start, and as soon as the rain comes, a new happiness, a new smell, a new fragrance.
Come, let us all move forward in love with nature in this environment.
My good wishes to all of you.
Talk of mind, April 2017
S.
Can a little focus on this aspect in the skill devolution
You've ever tried to run the cycle, but three-wheeler cycle that takes people
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in their children ' s eam .
Whose eam must have been finished, there'll be some Relie's mahol and where Eam will run, those families still have a little more preserved.
But at such a time, I will say that listen to what I have spoken to the students in the mind of the last time, you will definitely get those things done at the time of the examination.
Today is 26th March
March 26 is the day of independence of Bangladesh
A historic battle against injustice, unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bengal-Bandhu
And I wish that Bangladesh should move forward, develop and I also convince the Bangladeshis that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in this entire region by joining hands and shoulders.
We all are proud of the fact that Tagore, his memories, we have a partner legacy
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian person to receive the Nobel (Nobel) award, but also gave him the title of Knighthod by the British.
And when the British killed the Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was in those great men who had raised their voices and this was the period when a 12-year-old child had a deep impact on this incident.
In adolescence, the brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration of life to the child laughing in the farm-flong.
And in 1919, that boy Bhagat, 12, loved us all, we all inspired - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, Bhagat Singh ji and his companion, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British on March 23 and we all know that the incident of March 23 - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru's face was not afraid of satisfaction - death
All the dreams of life, had concluded for the life of mother and sister
And these three heroes are the inspirations of all of us today .
We will not be able to decorate the story of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru's sacrifice in words
And the entire British dominant was afraid of these three youths .
The prisoners were locked in jail, hanging was fixed, but how to go ahead with them, the British used to worry about it
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but was given only on March 23
Theft was done, which is not usually done
And later, by bringing his body into today's Punjab, the British burnt quietly
Many years ago when I had a chance to go there for the first time, I felt a kind of vivration in that land.
And I will definitely say to the youth of the country - whenever you get a chance, whenever you go to Punjab, go to Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt's tomb
This was the period when freedom fighter, his intensity, his business was going on growing.
On one side, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru had inspired the youth for armed revolution
So just a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha
This Champaran is the centenary of Satyagraha .
In the movement of India's independence, Gandhi thought and Gandhi style, its appearance was seen in Champaran for the first time
It was a turning point in the entire movement of freedom, especially in the way of struggle.
This was the period, the Satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill-majoram in Ahmedabad, and all of them had a deep impact on Mahatma Gandhi's idea and style of functioning.
In 1915 Gandhi returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave new inspiration to the country .
Today, on the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind, we can not evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on that image
Imagine that a person who returned to India in 1915, only two years' tenure
Neither the country knew them, nor did they have the effect, it was just the beginning
At that time, we can guess how hard they have to suffer, how hard they have to work
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organization skills, Mahatma Gandhi's power to know the Nabs of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behavior to organize a poor, unfamiliar person in front of the British elite, to struggle, to bring it to the ground for the struggle, it sees the wonderful power.
And so the way we experience Mahatma Gandhi ' s humility
But if you think of a hundred years ago, that champaran Satyagraha satyagraha, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of a very study for any person who starts public life.
How can public life be started, how much hard work has to be done and how Gandhi did it, we can learn from them
And that was the time, as much as we hear the names of the big veteran leaders, Gandhi was Rajendra Babu at that time, Acharya Kripalani ji, everyone was sent to the villages.
On one hand, fill the jail, on the other hand, buy yourself in creative work
A big wonderful Balance was in the style of Gandhi's work.
What happens to Satyagraha word, what can be disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a big kingdom - a complete new discourse was transferred by Gandhi not through words, but by a successful experiment
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, then who will be Hindustani, who does not want to change India, who will be Hindustani, who does not want to become a partner for change in the country
India is neither a government program nor a political party maniasto nor is it a product
India is calling for 100 million countrymen
This is the feeling that hundred and fifty million people want to create a grand India together
There are many people who go to the hospital daily, help patients
Many people are running for blood donation as soon as they know
There are many people, someone is hungry, so they worry about his food
Our country is multipurpose .
Public service is the Lord-service, it is in our rugs
If once we look at him as collective, see him as organized, then how big is it
If it's about India, it's criticism, discouraging, seeing it differently, it's very natural and it's indiscriminate in democracy.
But it is true that if twenty-four million countrymen resolve, decide the way to prove the resolve, take one-and-a-half feet, then the dream of New India 100 million countrymen can prove to our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are from the budget, from the government project, from government money
If every citizen resolves that I follow the rules of Traich, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full sincerity, if every citizen resolves that one day a week I will not use petrol-diseel in my life.
You see this country, which is dreaming of New I India, will see the dream of hundreds of millions of people in front of their eyes.
The meaning of saying is that every citizen follows his citizen's religion, follows duty
So why should not we also join Swaraj by disciplining our life in this journey of Suraj
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I want to express your gratitude today
In the last few months, there was an atmosphere in our country, a large number of people participated in the digital management movement.
How can cash transactions be done, its curiosity has also increased, trying to learn poorly and gradually people are also moving forward to doing cash business without it.
Since the demonetization ban, there has been a lot of increase in different ways of digital management.
My dear countrymen, black money, against corruption, we have to move forward.
Can 20 million countrymen resolve to work for two and a half million digital transactions in this year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life
You don't have imagination, but you can serve the country a lot and you can become a heroic soldier to fight against black money, corruption
In the past, for public education, many programs have been organized for the Design Mela for public awareness.
There is a resolution to do 100 programs across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward plan .
Approximately twelve lakh people have received this reward from the consumer .
Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth date is on 14th April
And as already decided, on 14th April Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary, this digit-mail is going to end.
A very big event is going to be completed a hundred days .
There is also a provision for a larger draw .
How to reduce cash, how to deal with notes, we contribute to it
My dear countrymen, I'm glad that every time I ask for suggestions from people to talk of mind, there are many types of suggestions.
But I have seen that there is always a request for cleanliness .
A bitia named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a student of 11th, has sent a message by phone: - Administrative Principal, Prime Minister, you are my simple Pranam
First of all , you have won with huge votes in this election .
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how important cleanliness is .
I go through the river everyday, in which people also put lots of garbage and contaminate the rivers
He comes through the Rispna bridge and also comes to my house
For this river we went to the settlements and also took a rally and talked to the people, but it did not have any advantage
I want to tell you to send a team or expose this thing through Newspaper, thank you
See how much pain of a daughter of class 11, brother-in-law
Seeing the garbage in that river, how much anger is coming to him
I think it is a good sign
I want the same, the anger of 100 million people in the mind of the countrymen is born to the dirt
Once anger will arise, anger will arise, anger will arise against it, we will start doing something against dirt
And it is good that the singer himself is also expressing his anger, giving me a suggestion, but he is also saying that he made a lot of efforts, but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement
Fear of filth is increasing .
Awareness, active participation, agitation, it has its own importance
But hygiene is more than the movement .
Work is difficult, but I have to do
I believe that in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, the emotion that has awakened, it indicates good results in itself.
Whatever is listening to the cow singer in my mind today, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of the cow singer should become a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I've been talking about the program, I've been receiving many suggestions on one thing from the beginning and that most people have expressed concern about Cood Wastage.
I don't even fill half of the flate filled in the stomach and then leave it there
You've ever thought how much we ruined from what we leave these swords
Have you ever thought that if you don't leave the lips, then how bad you can fill the stomach
That ' s not what I ' ve got to explain
Well, when mother serves small children in our family, she says that as much as you can eat, take as you can
Something starts trying, but still indifference to this subject is a social sedition.
Injustice to the poor is UIDE
Second, if savings, then the family also has financial benefits UID
Think for the society, it is good, but this topic is such that the family also has the benefit of I
I'm not urging too much on this subject, but I would like this awareness should be increased.
You will find such people somewhere in every state of India
His life can also inspire people that we don ' t swear .
We take as much as I have to eat.
Look, this is the way I am to change
And those who are aware of the health of the body, they always say - keep a little bit of the stomach, keep the plate a little empty.
And when it comes to health, then on April 7, there is World Health Day, Lord Health Day I
United Nations has set a target of health by 2030 .
We are also familiar with the word expression, but if we have to literally mean, some people call him depression.
One estimate that more than 35 million people in the world are mentally, suffering from expression
The trouble is that we do not understand this thing even in our neighborhood and maybe we hesitate to talk about this matter openly.
Who feels expression himself, he doesn't even speak anything, because he feels a little embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that the Pression is not so that it cannot get rid of it
has to create a psychological environment and it starts
The first mantra is, instead of expression of expression, I need its expression
Between your colleagues, between friends, between parents, brothers, with Teacher, tell you what's going on.
Sometimes the children living in the hostel of the alone becomes more afflicted with II .
Everyone in the house is going out somewhere, so says - No, no, I don't want to come today - I like to be alone
You ' ve ever noticed why do this
You must assume that it is the first step towards the expression direction ID
If he doesn't like to stay with you in a group, he's going to a corner alone, then try and see if I don't let it happen.
Give him the opportunity to stay in the middle with those people who talk openly with him.
While talking openly about laughing, motivate him to expression, expel him from what Kuntha has fallen inside him.
This is the best way .
and expression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases
Like Diabetes becomes the master of all kinds of diseases, the expression also destroys all our capabilities, to fight, to adventure, to decide, to destroy all our capabilities
Your friend, your family, your campus, your environment - they can also stop you from going to the expression and go, then I can bring you out
Another way ID
Help your mind, share their happiness and sorrow, you see, the pain inside you will go asleep.
If you try to understand their sorrows, you will create a new self-confidence within you.
By joining others, by serving someone, and by selflessness, you can easily lighten the burden of your mind
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy .
Free from stress, free from pressure, move towards happiness - Yoga helps a lot
June 21 International Yoga Day is ID
This will be the third year I
If there is any suggestion in your mind about the third international yoga day, then you must send your suggestions to me through my mobile application, guide me.
Whatever songs, poetry compositions you can prepare in relation to yoga, they should do so that they easily understand people ID
I would like to talk to the mothers and sisters today, because today the discussion of health has come out, the things of health are enough.
So the Indian government has made a big decision in the past .
Working classes in our country are women, our women who are working class and their number is increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and they are welcome, but along with women also have special responsibility.
Government of India has made a big decision
They are working class women, at the time of delivery, at the time of pregnancy, at the time of delivery, at the time of delivery, the maternity live that was available for the first 12 weeks, will now be given 26 weeks.
There are probably two or three countries in the world, which are ahead of us
India has made a very important decision for our sisters .
And his original purpose is to take care of that newborn child, future citizen of India, proper care of him in the early days of birth, if mother gets her immense love, then these children will grow up and become the subordinate of the country
Mother ' s health will also be good and this is why this is a very important decision .
And due to this , nearly 18 lakh women working in the ormal sector will get the benefit of it .
My dear countrymen, there is a sacred festival of Ramnavami on 5th April, Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, Baba Saheb Ambadkar's birth anniversary is I
The life of all these great men continued to inspire us, give me the power to resolve for New I India
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nav Sanvatsar, for this New Year, you have a lot of good wishes I
This is the time for farmers to get fruits of their hard work .
This new year is celebrated in different corners of our country in different forms
Gudi-Parva in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra-Karnataka as a new year, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh in the field of Awadh, Sanvatsar Puja in the field of Awadh, Satwani festival is held on New Year in Mithila, Bihar.
Innumerous, India is a country full of so many diversities
Cold weather is going to go now
The season of the dwelling placed us in the life of all .
New leaves start coming in the trees after the pattern .
Flowers bloom
Gardens become green
The bird ' s foolishness starts looking at the heart .
Not only flowers, fruits also appear to be shiny in the sunshine on tree branches
The summer results are seen in the morning of the mango .
In the fields, the yellow flowers of mustard bind expectations to the farmers
Strong flowers of tissues or plasses indicate the arrival of holi .
Wealthy Khasro has described the moments of this change of weather .
The festival of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi puts the color of happiness in human life
In love, brotherhood, humanity, we are about to leave Phalgun in the last month and are ready to welcome the new month chaitra.
Then thou shalt be a coincidence for two months .
I first thank millions of citizens of the country that before the matter of mind, when I ask for suggestions, all the suggestions come.
On NarendramodiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, from Postal, I thank everyone for this
And so they said that I ' ll give some information about the level and interceptor missiles of 104 satellites
Shobha ji, you have remembered the example of India's proudness
Whether to deal with poverty, to avoid diseases, to connect with the world, to reach knowledge, information - Technology, science has recorded its place.
15 February 2017 is a proud day in India's life
Our scientists have raised India ' s head proudly in front of the world
SRE has successfully launched various countries through Mega Missione, in which America, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India have successfully launched 104 satellites.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites into the interior
And it ' s also a pleasure that it ' s successive launch of 38th PS continuously .
It is a historic achievement for the whole of India, not for the SRO.
Brother-in-law, these 104 satellites are very important - cartosat 2 - This is India's satellite and it will help him very much for the photographs drawn through it, mapping of resources, interstructurer, assessment of development, urban devolution.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters who have all the water sources in the country, how can they be used, what should be kept in mind, this will help our new satellite cartosat 2 very much
Our satellite has sent some photos as soon as we go
She has started her work
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that all this campaign is led by our young scientist, our women scientist, they have done
Such a strong participation of youth and women is a great pride in the success of ISOR .
I congratulate the scientists of the ISOR on behalf of the countrymen.
For the general public, for the service of the nation, their Objectives to bring in superior science, they have always maintained and they are also creating new records.
Our scientists, as much as we give to their entire team, are as low as possible.
Shobha ji has asked another question and he is about India's security
India has achieved a very big achievement, about it
This thing has not been discussed yet, but Shobha ji has taken care of this important thing
Interception technology, this missile achieved success by stacking the enemy's missile at a height of about 100 kilometers from the earth during its trial.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security .
And you'll be glad to know, the world's hardly four or five countries that have this greatness.
When new technology sees, there is a new scientific proverb, then we enjoy people
and curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life
And those who have special intelligence talent do not let the curiosity remain in the form of curiosity, they also question within it, find new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And the same curiosity becomes the reason for new search
They don't sit quiet until they get answers
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life, then we can say that this development journey of human life is no longer complete.
Complete rest is impossible
The universe, the laws of creation, the effort to know the mind of man continues continuously.
New science, new Technology is born of that
And every Technology, as every new science, gives rise to a new age
My beloved young men, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in the mind that our youth should increase the attraction towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientific causes a permanent change in the lives of generations in the coming ages .
In the past, the Policy Commission and the Foreign Ministry of India had planned a major unity type of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful innovation was invited
Sometimes the problem also shows the importance of science to solve
The meaning of saying is that people of such role in society, in the country are very much
And our society is also becoming textnology driven
Arrangements are changing technology
in a way Technology is becoming an integral part of our life
In the past, there is a big emphasis on digitization
Gradually people are moving out of cash towards digital currency
Digital transation is also growing rapidly in India

My dear countrymen, it continues to run something in this direction of cleanliness by the government, through the society, through organizations, through organizations, everybody.
In one way everyone seems to be behaving aware about cleanliness in some form.
Government is constantly trying UIDE
In the past, a program of senior officials of 23 State Governments led by our Secretary of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which is the Ministry of Indian Government, was held in Telangana.
And not only seminar in closed rooms in Warangal of Telangana state, what is the importance of direct cleanliness work, using it
On February 17-18, I organized Toilet Pit Emptying Emercies in Hyderabad
Six home toilet pits were cleaned and officials themselves showed that the pits used by two pit toilets could be used and used again.
He also showed how convenient the toilets of this new Technique are and there is no discomfort about the cleaning of them, there is no hesitation, which is a psychological barrier, it also does not stop.
And we can also clean a toilet pit as well as normally clean
And the result of this effort was, the country's media also propagated it very much, gave him importance and natural, when an ID
If AS Afsar cleanses Toilet's pit, then it is very natural to take care of the country
And this is the cleaning of the toilet pit and the one you-we consider to be waste and waste, but look at the fertilizer, then it is a kind of black gold.
What happens to west, we can see I
And it has been proved .
For a six-member family a standard 2in Pit Toilet - this model is filled in about five years I
After this, the waste can easily be removed and redirectioned in another pit
In six-twelve months, the garbage deposited in the pit becomes completely decomposed.
It is very safe in handling the decomposed waste and fertilizer is very important in terms of fertilizer NPK
Farmers are well aware of NPK
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - This is full of nutritious elements I and it is considered to be very excellent fertilizer in the agriculture sector I
The way the government has taken these initiatives, and the others must have used such a lot of initiative.
And now there is a special programme of cleanliness news in Doordarshan .
There will be as much benefit as such things will be exposed in it, IV
Different departments celebrate cleanliness fortnight regulators in the government

And in the second fortnight of March and two ministries - Ministry of Shipping vessel Transport Ministry and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these ministries are also going to pursue the cleanliness campaign for the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy, increases self confidence
We all welcomed him, what our divine players performed in Rio Paralympics.
In the Einal of Blind T20 World Cup held this month, India has increased the pride of the country by making the world champion for the second time continuously defeating Pakistan.
I once again congratulate all team players
The country is proud of the achievement of these divine companions .
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are strong, strong, adventurous, strong.
Every moment we can learn something from them
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone
They are moving forward with their footsteps , and illuminating the name of the nation with their achievements .

All those players have a lot of me
World Women's Day celebrates March 8
In India too, giving importance to daughters, their awareness in family and society increased, sensitivity increased
Beti Bachao- Teach Beti This movement is moving fast
Today it ' s not just a government program
This has become a social sensitivity campaign for public education
During the last two years, this program has added general public opinion, has forced people to think about this burning issue in every corner of the country and has brought changes in the thinking of people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When the news comes that the festival was celebrated on the birth of the daughter, so much joy comes
In a way positive thinking towards daughters is becoming a cause of social acceptance
I have heard that the Ludalore district of Tamil Nadu state banned child marriage under a special campaign
So far more than 175 child wives have been stopped .
Jila administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Prosperity Scheme
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been added to the daughter-saving-Beti Teacho Yojna and along with orphan girls adopted by the district administration, ensure their education, its efforts are being made.
Under the program of every home knock in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run for the education of village-village daughters.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to reintroduce the girls who had been drop-out by running their child, their school campaign, to reinstate them in school.
The meaning of saying is that the daughter Bachao-Beti Teach this movement has also taken many forms
The entire movement is made of mass movement
New imaginations are associated with him
It has been turned down according to local needs
You are also actively connecting
You get me to know a lot
What's going on on the earth, what's going on in the village, poor's mind, she reaches me
I am very grateful to you for your contribution
Tomorrow, Sri Krishna Janma Mahotsav was celebrated throughout India
Nobody can imagine how personality will be, even after thousands of years, every festival comes with new inspiration, comes with new inspiration, comes with new energy and thousands of years old life is such that today, to solve problems, for example, can give inspiration, everyone can find solutions from the life of Sri Krishna, from the present problems
Sometimes to pick up the rock, sometimes, the work of raising the leaf of food, i.e., everything feels a newness and so, today, when, when I'm talking to you, I go to two Mohan, I'm gonna pay attention.
One Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, second Charkhadari Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, except the Yamuna coast, went to the coast of the sea in Gujarat, stable in the city of Dwarka and born on the coast of the sea, Mohan, born on the banks of Yamuna, come to Delhi, take the last breath of life
In the situation of that time, Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, thousands of years ago, to avoid the war, to avoid the struggle, his intelligence, his duties, his capabilities, his contemplation, and Charkhadhari Mohan also chose a way for freedom, to consolidate human values, to consolidate the fundamental elements of personality - This turned the war of freedom, which is strange for the whole world, even today is strange
The importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling in all the fluctuations in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna, and that is why Krishna Vande Jagadguru has also been known as Sri Krishna, Jagatguru.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and not only India, it is also discussed in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about Mahatma Gandhi's 150th anniversary
They served those farmers with whom there was a distinction in champaran, they served those mill workers who were not being given proper wages, they considered the service of poor, poor, poor, weak and hungry people as the ultimate duty of their lives.
Whoever, whenever, wherever needed, Mahatma Gandhi was always present for service
He not only emphasized the service but also emphasized the self-reliance associated with it.
The meaning of the word service is that it should be done with joy - service Paramo religion :
But, as well as excellent joy, freely, the feeling of this feeling is also in service, inner
This, we can understand the life of Bapu very well
For Mahatma Gandhi, person and society, humanity and humanity, that was all
Whether it is Phoney Carm in Africa, or Tolstoy Carm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, everywhere, in its unique style, they always have the strength of social development community mobilisation.
It's been my very good fortune, that I have got a chance to go to many important places related to the worshiper Mahatma Gandhi and bow down.
I can say that Gandhi used to emphasize organization and feelings with service
Social-service and social-generation community society and community society this is the spirit that we have to bring in our practical life
In the right sense, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the true workman
No countrymen
and collectivity has its own strength
This whole, Gandhi 150, in programs, collectiveness, and service too
Our Ladies is club
The works of the modern era of Ladies Club will continue, but all the colleagues of Ladies Club will work together with some or the other service work.
can do a lot
Collect books, distribute old, poor people, spread knowledge, and I believe that perhaps 130 million people have 130 million imaginations, 130 million ventures can be
There is no limit that comes in the mind - just a goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and service of full dedication sentiment and that too is free: happy: - for a unique pleasure
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I was dancing in Gujarat
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi, in the freedom movement, is a very important turning point
In Dandi, I inaugurated a museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi
The feelings arising from within your mind, any big literature will be more powerful, and it may be in today's time, in your sight, the form of a song written by your pen, perhaps it's more relevant.
Many programs, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming time.
But in this context a thing is interesting that I want to share with you
Haripura Panels were specially interesting in it
You will remember that there was a Congress session in Haripura in Gujarat where the incident of Subhash Chandra Bose ' s presidency act is recorded in history .
There is a very beautiful past of theseart panels
Prior to the Congress's Haripura session in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Art Bhawan
Gandhiji wanted to show the lifestyle of people living in India through art and perform this article work during the session .
This is the same dancing red boss whose heart work increases the glimpse of our constitution .
The Constitution gives a new identity .
And his art tool has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution
Nand Lal Bose visited the village around Haripura and eventually showing the lives of rural India, making some articles.
There was tremendous discussion in the enforcement of this unique artist
Once again, with the best wishes on Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, some resolution from every Hindustani, I expect
For the country, for the society, something to someone else should do
This will be Bapu's good, true, certified work
Mother Bharti's sons, you will remember that in the last few years, we run cleanliness service campaign across the country for about 2 weeks before October 2.
This time it will start from 11th September
During this time, we will get out of our houses and work Mahatma Gandhi through labor
Whether there is a house or a corridor, a square or a nali, school, college, to run a great campaign of cleanliness at all public places.
Similarly , we have to finish the work of Single Use plastic together
This will also save money and they will also be able to contribute to the environment .
This time on October 2, when Bapu celebrates 150th birth anniversary, on this occasion, we will not only dedicate him to open defecation, but on that day we will laid the foundation of a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Celebrate as October 2 special day
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic was collected , come forward for its proper disposal , system of disposal .
It can be recycled
It can be made fuel
Thus , till this Diwali , we can also complete the work of safe disposal of this plastic waste .
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhasit is a way of knowledge
We can find out what we want in life
These days my contacts have been very low , but I had a lot of contact .
The fools call stones as gems
In our culture , food is very glorious
Until We have converted the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us especially for women and newborns, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under the nutrition campaign, nutrition is being made public in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting malnutrition with new and interesting methods .
Sometimes a thing was brought in my mind
Inside the deficiency , a bitter paddy has become a big movement .
In this , in the days of crop harvesting , anganwadi sailors gather a fat grain from the people .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
The donor becomes a caretaker citizen of society .
After that he dedicates himself to this purpose and becomes a soldier of that movement .
All of us have heard of the rituals of food in every corner of India .
This rites are performed when they start feeding the child for the first time .
Diuid Cood not Solid Cood
Gujarat thought in 2010 why children should be given a constitutional cood on the occasion of food procession so that people can be aware about it.
It's a very nice initiative, which can be adopted everywhere,
People in many states run dinner operations
If there is a birthday in the family, there is a good day, a memory day, then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food, tasty food, go to schools and the family members serve children themselves, feed.
They also share their joy , and express their happiness .
There is a wonderful union of service and joy .
Parents, there are many such small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition
Today, in the absence of awareness, poor with malnutrition, and rich, both families are affected
The country will be celebrated as a September month nutrition campaign
You must join it, get information, some new couples you also contribute
If you bring a single person out of malnutrition , we bring the country out of malnutrition
This time when I was thinking about the mind , I was sure that there would be a lot of questions about this and that happened , and in the last few weeks I met people wherever I went Man vs.
I have not only joined Hindus worldwide youth with this episode , I had never thought that young hearts would become my place in this way .
I never thought of how many variety of things the youth of our country and the world pay attention to .
I never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of the youth around the world .
And what happens
I went to Bhutan last week
I have seen that as a Prime Minister, since I got an opportunity to go anywhere and due to International Yoga Day, the situation has become that if I sit to someone in the world, then some or the other five-seven minutes do ask me about yoga.
There is hardly any big leader in the world who has not talked to me about yoga and I have experienced it all over the world .
But these days a new experience is coming
Whatever gets, wherever he gets a chance to talk about Wildlife, he discusses about nvironment.
Tiger, Ion, creature and I am surprised how much people are interested
Discovery has planned to disseminate this program in 165 countries in their language .
I hope that this program has become a strong faith in India's message, India's tradition, sensitivity towards nature in India's ritual journey, this Episode will help the world with all these things, and now people want to know the steps taken in the direction of Climate Justice and Clane Environment in our India.
But another interesting thing is that some people also ask me one thing with hypothesis that Modi ji tells you were speaking Hindi and " Bear Grills" did not know Hindi so fast that how would you have been .
Are these subsequent redistributions
It's been so frequent shouting, what's wrong
They ask with great curiosity .
Look, there's no secret in it
Reality is that in conversation with Bear Grills technology was used plenty
So I used to speak Hindi but he was listening to English and because of that dialogue became very easy and this is the least of Technology .
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You people also must go to places related to Natural and Wildlife Nature and animals .
I've already said, I'm sure you must go to the North-east in your life.
You will be expanded
The country full of diversities will also fill you with these diversities as a teacher, you too, from within
Last month I got the privilege of issuing Tiger sessions in the country
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The population of tigers in India is 2967
A few years ago, half of it was too hard we were
Tigers were suspended in Russia's Saint Petersburg in 2010
It was taken a resolution expressing concern over the declining number of tigers in the world .
This resolution was to double the number of tigers all over the world by Twenty Twenty Two 2022
We doubled the number of Tiger here in 2019 itself .
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of protected areas and community reservations has increased .
When I was relaying the data of tigers , I also remember the lions of Gujarat .
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister there , the lions in the jungles of the giraffe were breaking the habitat .
their number was decreasing
We took a lot of steps after one in the gear
In 2007, it decided to deploy women Guards.
In order to increase tourism improve infrastructure
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife then only talk about conservation
But, now we have to go ahead with conservation and think about Compassion
We have a very good guidance in our scriptures
Therefore, we need to protect our forests, plants and wildlife not only, but also create an environment so that they can fruit properly.
Who can forget the historic speech of my beloved countrymen, 11 September, 1893 Deigaten niece Three Swami Vivekananda ji
This young sanyasi of India , which shook the human race all over the world , left India ' s stunning identity .
The words of great men like Swami Vivekananda, 11 September 1893, forced the world to change the view of seeing the world towards India.
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji, who had seen the form of India, had to go to the potential of India
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that on August 29, the national sports day is celebrated.
For everybody, it will be a big interesting campaign for children, elderly, youth, women, and it will be your own
But I ' m not going to tell her nuances today
I want to make you aware of itness and set some goals for the country for I India
My dear countrymen, I'll wait for you on August 29 in I India
Come on, let's go with a new humor, new resolution, new power
My dear countrymen, we'll get the same again in the matter of mind today
I'll wait for your suggestions, of your points
Come, let us all go freely to realize Gandhi's dreams to make India the dreams of freedom fighters:
Let ' s go with a sense of joy within .
My dear countrymen, you all bow down.
On January 26, our Republic Day celebrated all of us with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in the corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duty of citizens, the rights of citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way this ritual festival is also, which makes the coming generations aware of democracy, aware of democratic responsibility, even rituals.
But still in our country, the duty of citizens and the rights of citizens - the debate should be on it, the extent to which there should be debate, the wider it should be discussed, it is not happening yet.
I hope at every level, at every time, as much as the force is given on the rights, the same force should be given on duties.
On two tracks of rights and duties, India's democracy carriage can move faster.
Tomorrow is January 30, our god is the date of worship of Bapu.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who give life to the country by keeping the calm at 11 am, 2 minutes silent.
As a society, as a country, on January 30, 11, 2 minutes of tribute, it should be a simple nature.
Why not be 2 minutes, but collectiveness, resolution and reverence towards the martyrs also appear.
In our country, there is a comfortable respect for the army, security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the gallantry awards, which were honored with the gallantry awards, for their families.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal - many categories.
When they know deeply about their courage, gallantry, mercury, we also wonder, we also get proud, inspiration too.
On one hand, we were all happy with the news of the humor and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, the soldiers of our army in Kashmir who are engaged in the defense of the country, they got the hero and Gati due to avalanche.
I honourfully pay tribute to all these heroes, bow down.
My young colleagues, you know well that I keep talking about the mind constantly.
January, February, March, April - These are the months of criteria in every family, every month.
There are one-and-a-half, two children in the house, but the whole family is suppressed in the burden of Jeam.
So I realized that this is the right time that I should talk to students friends, talk to their prosecutors, talk to their teachers because for many years, where I got, the examination came to see the reason for a big problem.
Family problems, students are troubled, teachers are troubled, a big strange psychological environment is seen in every house.
And I always felt that I should come out of it and so I want to talk to young colleagues in some detail today.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this environment can't be happy
Well, the question is asked by the creation, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
It has worked for a year, now there is an opportunity to tell, this festival should be a festival of humorous enthusiasm.
There are very few people, for whom there is a pleasure in Eam, Eam is a preserve for most people.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a presure.
The plague that will be considered, will be found who will consider the preserve, he will regret.
And therefore I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination as if the festival is.
And when the festival occurs, when the festival occurs, then what is the best in us comes out of it.
The power of society is also felt at the time of the festival.
This is the power of the festival.
Even in Jeam, there should be an atmosphere of festival between the whole family, friends, around.
You see, it will convert to the presure, please.
Full environment will make the burden free.
And I urge the parents to make the atmosphere of a festival for these three-four months.
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months of examinations are done.
This is the responsibility of all of us that we change these three-four months every year in our own way, taking our tradition, taking the environment of our families, changing it to the festival.
And you must have seen that when you are happy, smile, you find Rela yourself, you are easily relaxed and when you are Rela, your years old things also easily remember you.
A year ago, what Teacher said in classroom, the whole scene remembers.
And you must know, the power to recall Memory, that's the most in the relation.
If you're in tension, then all the doors close, don't go inside, don't come out of the inside.
The idea process stops, it becomes a burden in itself.
How did you remember outside You were, nobody told it.
But who was inside, immediately came out and came out because you're relaxed.
And so the memory recalls if there's any medicine, then it's relation.
And this I tell my selfishness that if you are preserved, then we forget our things and rela are, then we can never imagine, suddenly such things are remembered, they are very useful.
But when tension happens, then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information goes down and your tension rides on it.
And so it is necessary, A maybe mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet. Sometimes it seems that we can't see the examination in the proper perspective.
It seems that he is a question of life and death.
Whatever you're going to give, that's eam of what you've studied in a year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
How you live life, how you live life, how you want to live, it does not have eam.
In your life, in Classroom, there will be chances of passing through many criteria except for the test given by notebook.
And therefore, the examination has nothing to do with the success and failure of life, get rid of such burdens.
They went to the Air Force, Hail.
Assume that due to that failure, if he gets disappointed, loses life, will India get such a big scientist, so big President does not get.
The points have become the most important.
Because of this, competitiveness has increased very much, along with the tension among the students has also increased.
So I would like to be aware of your ideas by taking this current direction of education and its future.
Although he himself has given a reply, but he wants to know that I should keep something in it.
Marks and marks-sheets have a limited use.
That's not what happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have earned.
Life goes on so that what you have to go, have you tried to live
Life then walks that you've got a sense of mission and which is your sense of impition, is there any coordination between your mission and ambition
If you rely on these things, you will never need to run behind the marks while pressing the marks.
You are going to work in life, skill is going to work, self confidence is going to work, will power is going to work.
You tell me, your family will have any doctor and all the family members will go to them, family doctors.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, then do you see that lawyer's marks-sheet
You see his experience, his knowledge, his success journey.
And so the points that are burdened, they sometimes stop us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I just say, not reading.
It's necessary to use it for your criterion.
I was tomorrow, I'm here today, she needs to know.
But if you do occupation at the point, pass on the marks, then you slowly shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area to get only marks.
So it may be that even though we become senseless in Eam, sometimes there is a failure in life.
Cha ji, one thing has also said that competitiveness.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Most successful players have a feature of life that they compete.
If we take the example of Sriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Breaking your own record for twenty years, defeating yourself every time and moving forward.
His great amazing life journey is because he adopted a way to compete more than competitiveness.
Friends in every field of life and when you're going to give eam, if you could read for two hours first, can you do it for three hours
From within, that energy is born automatically.
If you are better then you will be careless, you will be filled with great faith.
If you do bad against him, then you will be sad and disappointed, will be filled with jealousy, who will eat you, yourself, and if you are equal, you will never feel the need for improvement.
How will I do, how will I do better, just focus on it.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
Shriman S. Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the question of mathematics.
Once you learn to execute, the maximum problem will be over.
Facceptance opens the way to solve problems.
The expectations make the road difficult.
Accepting the situation, gives an opportunity to open new ways and therefore, accept what is there.
You will also be burdened.
A well-known person was in the hospital due to heart attack, then before the Lok Sabha of our India, Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, he was also M.P., he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not come and ask any question about his health.
As soon as he sat and came, he started listening to what is the situation, no matter what the disease is, no one started listening quietly and in the first two-four minutes, he made such an environment light.
By going to a sick person in a way, we scare the disease.
I would like to say to the parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Did you ever feel that in the days of Eam, there should be an atmosphere of laughter for children
You see, the environment will change.
I have a big lot of phone calls.
They do not want to tell the gentleman their name.
On hearing the phone, you will know why he does not want to tell his name
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I can not tell my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
I tried to counterfeit once in my childhood, for that I started making a lot of preparations to find out how I can copy, its ways, due to which my lot of time was wasted.
In that time I could even read the same number as I spent in putting my mind to copy.
And when I tried to pass, I was caught in it and because of me many friends around me suffered a lot.
Your point is correct.
The short-cut paths that are these become reasons for copying.
So the copy doesn't work. To cheat.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard repeatedly that don't copy, don't copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once there is a habit of copying, then there will be no desire to learn something in life.
Then where will you reach
Whatever your entire creative is, they spend in the ways of copying, if the same creative, this time you give on your eam issues, you probably don't need to copy.
The confidence that will increase from the result of the hard work of yourself will be wonderful.
This basic concept is wrong, the root of the problem is the same.
To develop all, there is a life outside the books and it is very huge.
This is also the time to learn to live.
Someone says that I will complete all the examinations first and play later, then it will be impossible if I do it later.
Have you ever thought that when all so much is in front, then two moments come out and look at the sky, look towards some trees and plants, lighten the mind, you see, with a freshness, you will come back in your room, between your books.
Whatever you are doing, take a little break, get up and go out, go to the kitchen, there is something you like, find a little, get your choice biscuit, eat, smile a little.
Maybe why not be five minutes, but you break.
You will feel that your work is getting simple.
Everyone likes it or not, I do not know, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to take deep breath.
Just come under the open sky, go to the roof, take a five-minute deep breath and sit for your reading, you see, the body will be relaxed from one breath and the relaxation of the body you feel, not that much relaxes the brain organs.
When I make meetings in the election, sometimes my voice sits.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me how long you sleep.
I said - Why brother, are you a doctor
No, no, say - This is a relation with your voice that is upset while speaking at the time of the election.
If you take full sleep, then your vocal card will get complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleep and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the significance of these things, you see, you'll be benefited.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but some will say that the Prime Minister has said, now there is no need to wake up, keep sleeping.
So do not do this, otherwise your family members will be angry with me.
And if your marks-sheet comes on the day you don't show them, I'll show them.
So do not do that.
And so I'll say P for preserved and P for Play, who plays, the preson who plays, who plays, shines. This is a very big medicine for mind, intelligence, body to keep him alert.
Well, young friends, you're preparing for the examination and I'm tied to you in mind.
It may be, even today's things will work for relation for you.
If possible, do not do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So as I advise your parents not to be burdened, they also apply to me.
Make the criterion a festival to cross every criterion.
Then there will never be a criterion, criterion.
Take this mantra and move forward.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and soldiers of Coast Guard for their service towards the nation.
It is a matter of pride that Coast Guard has made its place between all its 126 ships and 62 aircrafts built in the country.
While fulfilling this ideal sentence, the soldiers of Coast Guard are also ready to be in adverse conditions to protect the country's maritime boundaries and maritime environment.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in Coast Guard in our country, women are also playing their responsibility equally by joining the shoulders and successfully playing.
Our women of Coast Guard are pilots, work as members, not only, also handles overcraft.
Vidya is considered to be an opportunity to worship.
Not only this, inspiration is also a festival for the heroes.
My color is Basanti Chola - This is the same inspiration.
My countrymen have very good wishes on the sacred festival of this festival of Panchami.
In my dear countrymen, in the matter of mind, Akashwani always keeps filling new colors with her imagination.
Since last month, he has started listening to the mind in regional languages immediately after fulfilling my mind.
It has received a comprehensive approval.
People from far and wide are writing letters.
Talking about the mind gives me a big opportunity to join you.
Good good wishes.
Talk of mind, December 2016
But, in newspapers, new people are being caught everyday, notes are being caught, raids are being conducted, good people are being caught. How is this possible

Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali this time, I once again went to the border on the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali was something else
In the unique way, the country's 100 million countrymen dedicated to the soldiers of the Diwali army, dedicated to the security forces, its impact was expressed on the face of every soldiers there.
They looked filled with emotions and not only that, the best wishes and messages sent by the countrymen, in their happiness, the security forces of the country were a wonderful response.
And people sent messages, not so, they joined the mind
Somebody wrote poems, someone made pictures, someone made cartoons, someone made videos, i.e., every house became a checkpoint like the soldiers.
Working, with the contribution of all of you, the feelings of the soldiers of the country's army will be compiled in this book with your imagination, your emotions towards the security forces of the country.
A soldier's army wrote to me - Prime Minister, we are on the holi for the soldiers, Diwali every festival is on the border, always immersed in the country's security
Yes, still the house remembers at the time of festivals
But tell the truth, this time it doesn't seem like that
It doesn ' t seem that the festival is and I ' m not home
It feels as if we are celebrating Diwali with 100 million Indians
My dear countrymen, who realise this Diwali, the feeling that is in this environment, between the security forces of our country, among the soldiers, should they be confined to just a few occasions
I have appeal from you that we, as a society, as a nation, make our own nature, any festival made our nature, festival, be a happy atmosphere, we must remember the soldiers of our country's army in some form.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the power of the army increases 125 million times
Some time ago I had come from Jammu and Kashmir, all the heads of the village there.
He had an opportunity to talk to me for a long time .
He had come with some things about the development of his village, came with some demands, but when the talk was going on, it was natural, the situation of the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, all these things was natural.
And so loving, so open, these heads of the village spoke, everything was going to touch my heart.
I urged them to go and focus your attention on the future of these children .
Today I am happy that all these Prime Ministers who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise that they had given me.
We awakened the people away from the village .
Just a few days before, when Board's eam took place, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the Board examination nearly 95, fifty percent of the students of Kashmir.
The involvement of students in such a large number of board examinations points to the fact that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to get new heights of development through education for the bright future.
For this enthusiasm, I enjoy students, but I congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads with heart.
Brothers and sisters, this time when I ask for people's suggestions for the matter of mind, I can say that one-sided suggestions came.
Everyone used to say that talking more about 500-100 notes and more detailed
By the way, on 8th November, at 8 pm, addressing the name of the nation, I had discussed the introduction of an epic to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision, I had put it in front of you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties
But the more important decision is to implement that decision
And I also realized that in our normal life there would be a lot of new problems .
And yet I had said that the decision is so big, it will take 50 days to get out of its effect and then we will be able to increase the stature towards the normal situation
The diseases that we have been suffering for 70 years can not be easy to liberate from those diseases
I can understand your difficulties well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation
Despite many efforts are going on to confus you, even though sometimes the incidents of distracting the mind have come out, you have understood this path of truth, you have accepted this thing of countrywide.
Five hundred thousand and thousand notes and so big country, so much of currency, billions of notes and these decisions - the whole world is very closely watching, every economist is evaluating it, evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at whether India's 100 million countrymen will be successful even after suffering difficulties
There may be questions and signs in the minds of the world
India has only faith in India's 100 million countrymen, only faith, faith is believed to be fulfilling the resolution of 100 million countrymen.
And our country, like gold, will go out in every way, and its cause is the citizen of this country, its cause is you, the path of this success is also possible because of you.
All units of central government, state government, local Swaraj organizations, one lakh thirty thousand Bank Branches, millions of bank employees, more than 1.5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks and fishermen are engaged in this work day and night, dedicated
Between the stress of variety, all these people are working very calmly, considering it as a sacrifice of the country and the service, as an attempt to a great change.
Let's start in the morning, when the night is complete, don't even know, but all are
And the reason for that is that India will succeed in it, it is clearly visible
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working between such difficulties
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they see two steps forward
Somebody told me that a bright man in Khandwa became accident
Suddenly money was needed
The local bank employee came there and I was glad to know that he went to his house, that buzzer he received money so that he could help in treatment.
In such cases, countless stories appear in T.V. every day in the media, in the news, in the conversation
their strength was introduced .
Today, once again, he has taken that challenge and I believe that the resolve of 100 million countrymen, the collective men of all, will make this nation a new power.
But the evils are so extensive that even today some people do not have the habit of evil .
Still some people feel that these corruption money, these black money, these unaccounted money, these unaccounted money, will find some way and bring it back to the system
They're looking for illegal ways to save their money
It is a matter of grief that they also chose the way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing any work to them.
But, please don't play with the life of the poor.
You don't do anything that comes to the name of the poor on the record and when you check later, my beloved poor falls into trouble due to your sin.
And there is so hard law of Anonymous property, which is being implemented in it, how difficult will it be
And the government doesn ' t want our countrymen to have any difficulty
Any Mr. Ashish of Madhya Pradesh has fought against corruption and black money through this five hundred thousand and thousand, he has telephoneed me, he is appreciated: -Sar Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of village Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, Jila Harda, Madhya Pradesh
The currency you have closed thousands of rupees five hundred notes, it is very commendable
Similarly, I have come from a phone from Sriman Yelappa Wellankar ji of Karnataka: -Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Wellankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka.
I want to thank you, because you said good days would come, but no one thought you would raise such a big step.
Five hundred notes and thousand notes, seeing all this, teaching a lesson to black money and corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never come better than this
I want to thank you very much for this
Some things are found through media, people, through government sources, then the enthusiasm of working also increases a lot.
It's so happy, so proud that what is the wonderful potential of ordinary human in my country
And people go there, eat food and when they go back from there after 2-4-6 days, they return money again.
This is the power of my country, including service, sacrifice and authenticity
But I do not know that in the discussion on tea, marriage is also done
I came to know that on November 17, in Surat, there was a marriage that took place with discussion on tea.
In Gujarat, a daughter in Surat, who came to her marriage, did not drink tea only and did not drink any food program, nothing - because there was some difficulty due to the ban on money.
The Baratis also considered him as equal respect
Bharat Maru of Surat and Aksha Parmar - They have contributed to corruption through their marriage, against black money, what they have contributed in the fight, it is inspiring in themselves.
I also bless the newly married Bharat and Daksha with great blessings and also convert the wedding opportunity into this great sacrifice and congratulate it for reversing it into a new occasion.
Tea-worker lives and Tea-Worker receives weekly money
Now get a note of 2000 rupees, what did they do
Four women of the neighborhood got together and the four of them went together and paid a note of 2000 rupees, they did not need a small currency, because the four bought together and decided that they would get the next week, then we will sit and take account of it.
People are searching for ways themselves
Look how the life of the village is also changing
Some people have got immediate benefit from this campaign .
The country will get benefits in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefit
Every municipality is hardly 50 of the ta .
But this time , due to the 8th decision , everyone ran to deposit their old notes .
About three and a half thousand crore rupees came in 47 urban units last year.
You will be surprised to know, Anand will also be - in this one week, they have deposited 13 thousand crore rupees
Said three and a half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too comes from the front ,
Now that municipality has 4 times this money, it is natural, in poor settlements there will be a gutter system, water will be arranged, anganwadi system
There are many examples that in which its direct benefits are also visible
Brother-in-law, our village, our farmer, this is a strong donor of our country's economy
On one side, due to this new change of economy, among the difficulties, every citizen is adjusting himself.
But I want to especially enjoy the farmers of my country today
Now I was taking the figures of the sowing of this fashion
I was happy, whether it is cow, whether it is pulses, I had accounts till 20th of November, a lot of sowing has increased in comparison to last year.
Between difficulties, farmers have searched the way
The government has also made many important decisions, in which farmers and villages have given priority
Even after that there are difficulties, but I believe that the farmer who is suffering from all our difficulties, natural difficulties, always stands down, even at this time he stands down.
Small traders of our country, they also give employment, also increase economic activity
Millions of crores of rupees have been given to such small people from currency-yoga, because these small businesses, millions of people do and speed up the business of billions and millions of rupees.
But due to this decision , it was natural to have difficulty .
But I have seen that now our small businessmen are also working on the basis of faith, through mobile app, through credit card, through their own ways, through the mobile bank, through the technology.
And I want to tell my little business brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you also enter the digital world.
You also download the App of Banks on your mobile phone
You also keep the PSC machine for credit card
I invite you that you can contribute a lot to making cashless society, you can create a complete banking system on your business, mobile phone and today there are many ways other than notes, which we can run business
Technological paths are, says, security is and quick
I would like you to help just succeed this campaign, not so, you also lead the change and I believe you can lead the change.
I want to tell funny brothers and sisters too, you've been exploited.
There is a pawn on paper and when it is given in hand, then the second is
Sometimes gets full, then someone stands outside, he has to give cut and makes this exploit a part of life.
With this new system, we want to account in your bank, deposit money of your salary in your bank, so that you follow minimum wages
And once money has come in your bank account, you also do not need a small mobile phone - no big smart phone, nowadays your mobile phone also works as e-botoway - you can also buy money from the same mobile phone in the small shop of neighborhood.
So I urge the funny brothers and sisters to become partners in this scheme, because ultimately such a big decision should be made for the poor of the country, for the farmer, for the fun, for the deprived, for the victim, his benefit should be met.
Today I want to talk to young friends .
We say in the world that India is a country that has 65 population, less than 35 years of age
You're young and young in my country, I know, my decision has come to you.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you also contribute very positively to this thing
But friends, you're my true soldier, you're my true partner
We have seen a wonderful opportunity to serve mother Bharti, there is an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
I'm not gonna talk to you so much
As much as today's world experiences you, the old generation does not have
Maybe, your elder brother Saheb will not even know in your family and parents, uncles, uncles and mothers may not even know
You know, what happens to App, he knows what happens, Conline Banking, how does Conline Ticket Booking happen, you know
things are very common for you and you also use
But today the great work that the country wants to do, our dream is cashless society
It's fine that 100 percent cashless society is not possible.
And I want your physical help in it, you need your time, you want your resolve and you will never disappoint me, I believe, because we are all people who want to change the life of the poor of India.
You know, how many opportunities today are for castles society, for digital banking or for mobile banking
Each bank provides online facility
Wallet directly means e-batua
Several types of cards are available
Ordinarily that exiture phones can also be cass transverse
Dhobi should be seller, seller of vegetables, seller of milk, seller of newspapers, seller of tea, seller of gram, everyone can use it comfortably
And I too gave up to make this system more simple
All banks are engaged on it, are
My young friends, even after all this, a whole generation is such that it is unaware of it.
And all of you, I know well, are active in this great work
The kind of creative message you give on httsApp - Slogan, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and mocking - I am seeing everything and amidst the challenges this is the creation power of our young generation, so it seems as if it is the characteristic of India land that Geeta was born in the battlefield in a time of war, we are going through such a big change, then in you also the fundamental creative system is visible.
But my beloved young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work
G-G, I say again, I need your help and you, you believe me millions of young people from my country will do this work
Teach the shopkeeper how business can be done
You voluntarily have this cashless society, the pride of bringing out of these notes, campaign to free the country from corruption, campaign to get rid of black money, campaign to free people from difficulties-communications - You have to lead it
Once you'll teach people how to use Rupay Card, it'll bless you.
If you teach these arrangements to the common citizen, then he may get rid of all the concerns and if this work is done, I do not believe it will take more time.
Within a month, we can stand in the world as a new modern Hindustan and you can do this work through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 homes every day, add 10 homes to it.
This country has made a big revolution
My young men, I once again, once again with great urge you say you proceed to this campaign
You must have seen, Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is moving ahead of cleanliness campaign
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread in his rage and then he remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth and birth.
He has written that Harivansh Rai is a poem of ji and he has written a line of soil, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction
Harivanshrai ji used to introduce himself through it .
Soil of soil, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction, then his son Shriman Amitabh ji, whose rings are running a mix of cleanliness, he has sent me to write, using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Clean mind, clean India, my introduction
I bow down to Harivansh Rai ji respectfully
I also thank Mr . Amitabh ji for joining the mind in this way and for pursuing the work of cleanliness .
My dear countrymen, now your ideas, your sentiments, through your letters, keep me constantly on Narendra ModiApp, on your letters.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages it is about to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, thank you all of Deepawali's best wishes.
Deepawali festival is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country that 365 days, in any corner of the country, there is no festival.
Those who see from a distance will feel that such as Indian life, this is the second name of the festival, and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been traditional in India since Vedic times have been a festival of timely change, we have seen the courage to end the tradition of the Kalabaya festivals and changes in the festivals according to the demands of time and society have also been easily accepted.
But one thing in these can be seen well that this whole journey of the festivals of India, its business, its depth, its penetration in the public, its penetration is connected to a original mantra.
Extension of personality and personality, efforts should be made to detail the scope of your limited thinking, from society to the universe and do it through festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have collected in the festival with great scientific ways.
Today the whole world discusses the Environment.
Nature destruction is a matter of concern.
The festival of India has been going to ritualize tradition, culture and love, from child to every person.
There are trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody's obligation to the obligations.
Nowadays, we celebrate Sundai's holiday, but those who are old generation people, are merchants, fishers, you must have seen that we had tradition here for centuries to celebrate full moon and amavasya.
That is, even our holiday here was developed with the tradition of celebrating with the universal and science.
Today when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours comes with a sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message of going from Tamso Ma Jyotirgmay - darkness to light.
By burning the lamp of Deepawali, the blindness of the society is shadowed, the person is also free from the blindness which is shadowed, and the same is the festival of lighting by burning Diwali.
One thing we all know, go to any corner of India, go to the house of rich-se-Amir, go to the hut of poor and poor, in the festival of Diwali, the campaign of cleanliness is seen in every family.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
If you have poor utensils of your soil, then the soil utensils also clean such as if this Diwali has come.
Diwali is also a cleanliness campaign.
But, the time requires that not just cleaning the house, cleaning the entire premises, cleaning the entire village, we have to expand our nature and tradition, expand.
Deepawali's festival is no longer limited to India's borders.
In all the countries of the world, the festival of Deepawali is remembered in some form, celebrated.
Many governments of the world, the Parliament there, the rulers there are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
The picture has been placed on nstagram and he has shared that picture with the world and has done with great pride.
And what is the picture.
16 women of Singpore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian sari and this photo viral has happened.
And all this has been decreed for Diwali .
Now the New ealand Prime Minister had come, he told me that I have to go back soon because I have to join the Diwali ceremony there.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light is also becoming an inspiration festival of bringing the world community from darkness to light.
In an attempt to raise many firecrackers, they invite a huge unequality.
Never notices what things are there in the surroundings, there will be no fire anywhere.
News of unequality in the days of Deepawali, news of fire, news of death, great concern.
And a problem also happens that in the days of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their family in large numbers, then a crisis gets added to the crisis.
That's not just one day.
Say Govardhan Pooja, brother Dooj, say the benefits, and take the light of Kartik Purnima, then in a way a long period runs.
At the same time, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
The festival of Chhath-Puja is a very big festival in the eastern region of India.
There is a way of Mahaparva, runs for four days, but its characteristic is - gives a big deep message to the society.
But the saying is that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Sixth-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a very big social message .
I should talk about the festival of Deepawali, talk about the sixth-puja - this is the time to give you all good wishes, but at the same time there is more time for me, especially thanks to the countrymen, thanks.
For the last few months, the incidents that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting everything for our happiness.
My emotions are shadowed on the soldiers of the army, the soldiers of the security forces, this sacrifice, penance, labor, my heart and heart.
And one of the same thing was done in the mind that it was dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen to Sandesh to Soldiers for a campaign.
But I want to say today by bowing down the head, Hindustan will not have any such human being, in whose hearts the unprecedented love of the soldiers of the country is proud of the army, respected to the security forces.
The way it has been revealed, it is going to give power to every countrymen.
We can not imagine the security forces, so much courageous, your message has appeared as a power.
Should be a school, college, student, village, poor, businessman, shopkeeper, politician, player, sing-will be saved - hardly anybody who has not burnt to the soldiers of the country, has not given a message to the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed this Deepotsav in the opportunity to express gratitude to the army and why not, whether it is BSF, RPF, I
Endo-Tibetan Police, Assam Riles, Water-Sena, Staff-Sena, Nuve-Sena, Coast Guard, I can't speak everyone's name, countless.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, there is also a new power in that memory.
The capability increases in a message and the country showed tax.
I really express gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did through art.
Sandesh to Soluders on this shtag so many things - all these things have come, symbolically.
I have sent a poem to Shriman Ashwani Kumar Chauhan, I would like to read him
Ashwani ji has written - I celebrate the festival , joy , smile , I celebrate the festival , joy , smile , all this is because you are, this is because you are telling you today, because of my livelihood, because I slept with joy because you are postponed to the border because you are stationed on the seashore , the mount Amber and the glass of India smile you, the moon of India smilesses you , the enemy of India , the enemy of mine , the enemy of mine , the enemy of you , the enemy of mine .
My dear countrymen, whose mother is also full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also full of army personnel, such a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Come on, let us hear what the Fauji family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
Our Fauji brothers are getting very encouragement from the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign on this Deepawali.
I'm from an Army family.
My husband is also an Army Officer.
My hather and hather-in-law, both have been Army officers.
So we are filled with full family soldiers and we have many officers on the border, who are getting so good messages and are getting great encouragement in Army Aircle.
And I would like to say that their families, their wives with Army officers and soldiers also do a lot of jobs.
My dear countrymen, it's true that the soldiers of the army are found standing on every front of life, not just on the border.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from open defecation, epication was ree.
Earlier Sikkim was the province, now Himachal also happened, Kerala is going to be on November 1.
TBP jawan, Shri Vikas Thakur - he is originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So in the village, he was probably going to be somewhere in the village, then he reached there and was discussing in the village meeting, to make toilets and it was found that some families were unable to make toilets in the absence of money.
This development Thakur is a full of patriotism .
And then came the power of doing Himachal Pradesh Pen Decation Ree.
Similarly in Kerala, I really want to thank young people.
I came to mind, in far-flung forests of Kerala, where there is no way, after walking all day long, it can be difficult to reach that village, such a tribal panchayat Idmalakudi is also difficult to reach.
People never go.
In view of him, in the urban area, students of nigneering came to know that toilets are to be built in this village.
NK Cadet, people of NSS, students of ngineering, all decided together that we will make toilets.
All the goods that were to be taken to make toilets, bricks, cement, all these goods were lifted on their shoulders and went to the forests of walking all day long.
Work is going on very fast in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken this work, the entire state, I believe that the Kerosene will be very soon.
How big changes will come, theft will also stop, the environment will also benefit, our Origin Dechange will also save and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yeah, if there's a problem, the middlemen will be, the dishonesty will be.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi, are always a guide for all of us.
Everything of them should be called the country even today, how to go, determines the standard for this.
Based on this standard you decide.
It's time to ask us now, the aspirations of the poor people of the country have to be addressed.
To get rid of the troubles, we have to take one step each other.
Whatever our old thinking is, but society has to be freed from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now there are also toils for girls in schools, there are also toils for children.
This is the opportunity of the experience of discrimination-free India for our daughters.
Tubectomy is done by the government, but still millions of children get rid of vaccination.
A campaign of Mission Indradhanush vaccination, which has also been used to eliminate the missing children, which gives children the protection of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, after cooking food on poor mother, wood stove, take 400 cigarette smoke in your body, what will happen to her health
Trying to give 5 million families a life free of smoke.
The small businessman, small businessman, seller of vegetables, seller of milk, running a new shop, was such a furore in the interest of the moneylenders - it was furious.
Money scheme, stand up plan, public money account, is a successful campaign of freeing from interests.
To deposit money directly in banks through the base, the entitled get the beneficiary directly money.
This is an opportunity to free from intermediaries in the life of ordinary humans.
There is a campaign to run, in which there is no improvement and change, the way to release from the problem is to be confirmed and it is happening.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 31 October, the great men of this country - the unity of India who made the mantra of their lives, showed them - such a festival of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's birth anniversary.
But the phone of a gentleman of Punjab, his pain, touched me: - Prime Minister ji, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking to Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, Sardar Patel ji's birthday is on 31st.
And as we all know how there were events in the country after their murder.
Sir, I wanted to say how we can stop such unfortunate events, which occur in events.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is a witness that after Chanakya, the Bhagirath work of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Successful efforts to bring Azad Hindustan under a flag, such a big saffron work that the great man did, that great man was suppressed.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lives for unity, due to his priority of unity struggling for unity, many were also victims of annoyance, but never left the path of unity
On the birthday of that great man who lives for unity and on the birthday of Sardar, an injustice to the Sardars, a page of history, hurts us all.
But, in the midst of these crisis, one has to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Ekta in diversity is the power of this country.
We also avoid scattered thinking, scattered tendency, save the country.
Sardar Saheb gave us an India, we all have the responsibility of making the best India.
The original mantra of unity creates the strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar Saheb's life journey started with the struggle of farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in reaching the freedom movement to the farmers.
Sardar Saheb's successful effort to make the freedom movement strong in the village was the result of his organization power and skill.
But Sardar Sahib was just a person of struggle, not that, he was also a man of structure.
Today sometimes we listen to Amul's name.
People are also familiar with every product of Amul today outside India and India.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb's divine view was that he had imagined the Union of Co-operative Milk Producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima in the series of these Diwalis - this is also a festival of light festival.
Guru Nanak Dev, his education and education for the entire human being, not only for Hindustan, for the whole human species, is still a guide.
Service, truth and patience, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the basic mantra of peace, unity and goodwill.
Discrimination, superstition, evil, that campaign to get rid of the society was only in every matter of Guru Nanak Dev.
When we were on the peak of the specific, untouchable, caste-prostitution, height-nest, its deformity, Guru Nanak Dev chose brother Lalo as his ally.
Come on, we also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to leave discrimination, orders something against discrimination, everyone's development with this mantra is to go ahead, then who is our guide better than Guru Nanak Dev.
I also pray to Guru Nanak Dev, this light is coming, then I pray to the interpretation.
My dear countrymen, once again, the names of the soldiers of the country are Diwali, on this Diwali, you also wish great good wishes.
Your dreams, your resolves are successful in every way.
Your life becomes a life of happiness and happiness, that's what I give you all good wishes.
Thank you very much.
In the past, in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, in a terrorist attack, we lost 18 virgins of our country.
I bow to all these brave soldiers and pay tribute to them.
And so I will tell the countrymen so much today and what I said on the same day, I want to repeat it today that the culprits will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we trust our army.
We're fond of our army.
I want to talk specially to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding anti-national forces well.
And as they have started understanding the truth, they have separated themselves from such elements and walked on the path of peace.
Every parents want to work properly at the earliest.
Farmers also feel that their fruits, fruits etc. have been prepared, they reach the market of India.
Economic business also went well.
And the business has started running smoothly for the last few days.
We all know - peace, unity and goodwill are also the way to solve our problems, our progress is also the way to our development.
For our future generations, we have to cross the new heights of development.
I believe that we will find solutions to every problem together, we will find ways and along with the best way for the future generation of Kashmir.
Security of the citizens of Kashmir, this is the responsibility of governance.
To make law and order, the government has to take some steps.
Sometimes people who think differently from what we think, also have new ideas.
In social media these days I get a chance to know a lot.
From every corner of India, the feelings of every kind of people get an opportunity to know and understand and it promotes the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshvardhan of the 11th class considered a different kind of idea in front of me.
He wrote that after the Uri terrorist attack I was very distraught.
But there was no way to do, and what a little student like me can do.
So I came to mind how I would also work for the country and the country.
And I convinced you to study 3 hours a day.
I can work in the country, I will become such a worthy citizen.
Brother Harshvardhan, at such a young age in this environment of resentment, you can think healthy, this is a matter of happiness for me.
But Harshvardhan, I will also say that the resentment in the minds of the citizens of the country is a lot of value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this emotion and world of the country with a very excellent way.
And he inspired Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan Mantra and the common man of the country to work for the country.
Another way to express patriotism among the voice of the bomb-book is for every citizen, it was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
Mahatma Gandhi also used to launch freedom, when the movement was on intensity and a stop was needed in the movement, he used to successfully inspire the intensity of the movement towards creative work in the society.
We all have their responsibility, the people sitting in the regime will perform their duty and we will surely cross the new heights, with the passion of the countrymen, every citizen, this patriotism, we also make some creative contribution, then the country will cross the new heights.
My beloved countrymen, Mr. T. S. Kartik wrote to me on the NarendramodiApp that those who went to the apartments, they created history and their performance is the victory of Human Spirit.
Sriman Varun Vishwanathan also wrote on NarendramodiApp that our objections did a very good job. You should mention it in the matter of mind.
You're not two, every person in the country has an emotional attack on our players in Paralimpiques.
Perhaps more than the game, the performance of this paralympics and our players has completely changed the attitude of humanity, attitude towards Divyang.
And I will never forget this thing of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he received the medal, he said that I have defeated disability from this medal.
There is a lot of power in this sentence.
This time, 19 women, including 3 women from our country, participated in Parlimpics.
When Divyang plays in comparison to the rest of the games, physical capacity, sports skill, this is also the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be surprised to know that our players have achieved 4 medals while performing the best till now - 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze medal.
Devender Jhajharia, brother who received the gold medal, brought the gold medal again in the throw and brought it again after 12 years.
And they were not Devyang from birth.
Due to electric currencies, they had to lose one hand.
You think, the person who receives the first gold medal at the age of 23 and at the age of 35, he will have a great idea in life.
Maryappan won gold medal in Thangavelu Ligh Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of just 5.
The poor also did not come under the control of their resolve.
Neither are they from the big city, nor are they from the middle class rich family.
Despite passing through the difficulty of life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, the country has given medal to the country with the strength of determination.
Atlete Deepa Malik has joined his name to hoist many victories in the name of Malik.
Varun C. Bhati got a bronze medal in the high jump.
"Parlympics' medal, it has its importance, in our country, in our society, in our society, in our neighborhood, our divine brothers and sisters, these medals have done a lot of work to look at them."
Our condolences have been awakened, but the attitude of seeing these people is also changed.
Very few people will know how these people have crossed the Paralimpix this time.
Just a few days ago, the limpics were confirmed at the same place.
Someone can think that Divya people also breaked, broken the recoord of General Limpics.
This time it has happened.
In the race of 1500 meters, in the flampics that had been confirmed, the recognisant of Gold Medal made the recognition, Abdelati Baka of Algeria in Divya's competition 1.7 seconds in less time, in 1500 meters race, made a new recoord.
Not only that, I am surprised that in the Divya people whose fourth number came as a runner, no medal was found, he ran in less than those who got gold medal in general runners.
I once again congratulate all these players, and in the coming days, India is also moving forward to create a smooth plan for the development of Paralimpiques.
My dear countrymen, last week I have many wonderful experiences in Navsari of Gujarat.
He also told me some parts, and he was surprised when I presented it to the people, there too.
On that day I got an opportunity to inaugurate a book, he collected successful stories of life of some divine people.
There were big inspiring incidents.
The Indian government recorded a world on Navsari's land, which I consider to be important.
Within eight hours, six-seven Divyangjan, who could not hear, successfully used to eat machines to listen to them.
He got the place in Guinness Book of World Record.
It is a matter of pride for the countrymen to be three or three World Records by the Divyas in the same day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we started Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of worshiping Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness - this nature should be made, every citizen should be duties, there should be an environment of hatred towards dirt.
Now, when two years are happening on October 2, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of the country's 100 million people.
And I had said one step towards cleanliness and today we can all say that everyone has tried to move forward one step.
That means that the country has moved towards cleanliness, hundred and fifty million steps.
This is also confirmed, the direction is correct, how good the fruits are, what happens with a little effort, it has also come to the notice and so everyone wants to be normal citizens, whether the government's offices or the roads, buses or rails, schools or colleges, whether there are religious places, from children to elders, village poor, farmer women, everyone is contributing to cleanliness.
Midia's friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, efforts have been sufficient, and we will succeed, these beliefs have also been born.
It is also necessary and only then, if you talk about rural India, so far two crore eighty-two lakhs, i.e., about two and a half million toilets have been constructed and in the coming year 1.5 million and toilets are intended.
I had just gone to Gujarat, then the officers told me that Porbandar, who is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove the goal of Porbandar on October 2.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, greet them, who are trying to do it, and I urge the countrymen to respect the mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, we have to free the country from this problem. Come, let us take the resolution and move forward.
Especially I want to present a plan for young friends, who nowadays use a lot of technology.
What is the situation of cleanliness mission in your city Everyone has the right to know and for this the Indian government has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated Mahatma Gandhi's centenary. And in 2019, Mahatma Gandhi's 150th anniversary is about to celebrate.
These numbers - you will not only be able to know the situation of construction of toilets in your city by phone, but also to apply for making toilets.
The Indian government has also applicanted the corporate world that they came forward.
Whatever you want to work for cleanliness, sponsor such youth processionals.
They can be sent as clean India Ellows inside the districts.
This cleanliness campaign is not even talked about being limited to rituals.
Cleanliness becomes a nature, so much is not enough.
In today's era, health connects with cleanliness, along with cleanliness, Revenue mode is also mandatory.
It is also necessary to have a part of it and therefore we have to move forward with the cleanliness mission as well as as asset to composste.
Certilier companies have told them to buy the composste that is ready from the Wast.
Provide these farmers who want to go to organic farming.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, focus on the health of the earth, which has suffered a lot due to chemical reality, if they need such fertilizers in some quantity, then they should be provided.
And Shriman Amitabh Bachchan is making a lot of contribution to this work as Brand Ambassador.
This is something like doing.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers, Metropolitans Mayor, Commissioner - all of these together are just and just cleanliness - deep contemplation on this.
What can happen in Technology
How can the employment opportunities be increased in it
All the topics are going to be discussed.
And I'm seeing that new news comes continuously for cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and launched Jagaran campaign for the construction of toilets.
He himself laboured and he contributed to making about 9 thousand toilets.
In the past, you must have seen, a team led by ing Commonander Paramveer Singh, from Devprayag in the Ganges to Ganga Sea, swimming for 2800 kilometers and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Indian government has also made its own departments, a year-long calendar.
Every department focuses on cleanliness for 15 days.
In the coming October, from 1 to 15 October, learning water and स्वच्छता department, Panchayati Raj Department, Rural Development Department - these three are going to work by making a road-map of cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two weeks of October, October 16 to October 31, three more department Agricultural and Army Welfare - Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Cood Processing I
My citizens also request that if you have any connection with the work done by these departments, then join you too.
You must have seen, these days the survey of cleanliness is also going on.
Once upon the first time, the situation of cleanliness by surveying 73 cities was presented to the people of the country.
Now more than 1 lakh people who are near 500 cities, have their turn and due to this there is a belief within every city that let's go brother, we are behind, now next time we will do something good.
There is an environment of cleanliness.
I hope all the citizens should contribute to this campaign.
The birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji is on October 2.
Swachh Bharat Mission is going on for two years.
I keep urging from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, to buy something or the other of Khadi.
This time also I urge that every family should have something of khadi so that Diwali's water is given in the poor's house.
On October 2, while Sunday is, as a citizen, can we join ourselves somewhere in cleanliness
2 hours, 4 hours physically add yourself to the work of cleaning and I tell you that one photo of what you've been involved in the cleaning operation will show me on the NarendramodiApp.
If you're video, do video share.
Look, with the efforts of the people across the country, once again this movement will get new power, new speed will be achieved.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a joy in their own life, nobody recognises her or not.
The needy people have food items, clothes, all this is their campaign to collect and reach them.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to go out in the streets and used to donate the old toys that were with the families, and the toys which used to come, they used to present in the huge settlement that was in the courtyard.
This is a kind of donation festival.
I give great good wishes to the young people who are engaged in this work.
My beloved countrymen, today is 25th September, Pandit Deendayal is the birth anniversary of fast ji and from today the centenary year of his birth is starting.
The principle of public interest-servation Sukhaya Antyodaya - is giving it to them.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the welfare of the last edge.
How did the poor person get the fruit of development
He had presented the entire economic agent in every field of water, in two words.
Countries celebrate their birth centenary year as poor welfare year.
The society, the governments, everyone's attention, how to get the benefits of development, focus on it and then we can get rid of the country from poverty.
It is a symbolic form of the same year's poor welfare year.
The inspiration of all of us, I respect the rich faithful Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji of our ideological heritage.
I started talking about my favorite countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashmi, two years ago.
I had an authentic effort that it should not be a program to calculate the government work.
How does the normal human of this country inspire me
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
When I am being completed today 2 years this week, the way you appreciated the mind, the way you blessed, I thank all the audience's heart for this.
I am also grateful to Akashwani that he not only broadcast these things to me, but made a lot of efforts to reach him in all languages.
I am also grateful to those people who wrote letters after the matter of mind, by giving suggestions, dispersed the government's doors, highlighted the government's shortcomings and Akashwani made special programs on such letters, calling the people of the government, Providing plot to solve problems.
So the matter of mind is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, it became a new opportunity for social change.
What can be the reason for great satisfaction for anybody and so I thank everyone who is involved in making it successful, I express their gratitude.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri and Durga-Puja next week, the festival of Vijayadashmi, preparations for Deepawali, a different environment is in the entire country.
This is a festival of power and excitement. The unity of society is the power of the country.
Whether it is Navaratri or Durga-Puja, how does it become a festival of worship of unity of society
How to become a festival connecting people
And that is the means of true power and then we can go and celebrate the festival of victory together.
Come on, let's seek power, let's go about the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on August 29, Hockey's magician is the birth date of Chand ji.
This day is celebrated as a national sports day throughout the country.
I pay homage to Meditation Chand ji and on this occasion you all want to remind them of their contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in getting India the gold medal of Chocky Hockey in the Limpic Games.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked for Dhyan Chand ji - he was a living example of patriotism and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, a opposition player hocked on the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
At that time there was only 10 minutes left to complete the match.
And Meditation Chand ji made three shells in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of the injury with the shell.
My dear countrymen, however, whenever the time comes to mind, there are many suggestions on My Gov or NarendramodiApp.
The general citizen's attachment to Rio limpic, so awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something on this, I am watching it a very positive.
Even outside cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, so awareness and so many information.
Reading this message for me, this also became the reason for a great inspiration in itself.
A Sriman Ajit Singh has written on Narendra ModiApp, please talk about his participation in daughters' education and sports in the mind this time, because he has honored the country by winning the medal in Rio Limpic.
Some Sriman Sachin writes that you are requested to mention the mind of this time about the Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
The medals we received were given by the daughters.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
It seems, as the daughters of the whole of India have taken the initiative to illuminate the name of the country.
Summit on MyGov Thakur has written that we could do even better in the limpic.
He has written, Adriya Modi Sir, first congratulated the two medals we won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention to whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to set a long journey in sports.
Our parents still emphasize studies and excuses on education.
The game is still considered to be a waste of time in the society.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs motivation.
And nobody can do this work better than you.
Some such Sriman Satyaprakash Mehra has written on Narendra ModiApp, in the matter of mind, there is a need to excuse the Center-Curricular Activities, especially children and youth to take sports.
In a way, thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
It can not be ruled out that we can not perform according to our hope.
In some cases, it happened that our players who used to perform in India, what they used to perform in the sports here, they could not even reach there, and only two medals were found in the medal table.
But it is also true that even if you look carefully despite not receiving the medal, then for the first time in many subjects, the players of India have shown a lot of good work.
Now, see, under Shooting, our innovative Bindra ji remained in fourth place and lost the medal from a very short distance.
Deepa Karmakar also earned in Gymnastic - he remained in fourth place.
But how can we forget this one thing that she is the first Indian daughter to quoly for limpic and limpic inal.
Something similar happened with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna's pair in tennis.
We performed well this time in Athletics.
After P.T. Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar has quieted for track lifes.
You'll be glad to know, after 36 years, the female hockey team reached limpic.
Krishna Yadav reached the uarter-inal in development, but could not find Brone.
Many players, such as - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performances are good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do the same thing, then we may be disappointed again.
I've announced a committee.
The Government of India will go into its depth. What are the practices happening in the world, it will study.
We'll make a roadmap of what we can do.
2020, 2024, 2028 - We have to plan with a far-reaching thinking.
I also urge the state governments to create such committees and what can we do within the sports world, what can we do to each state, what the state likes one of its games, two games
And I also request every citizen in India that anyone who is interested in it, send suggestions to me on Narendra ModiApp.
Write to the government, discuss Association and give your memorandum to the government.
State governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
My beloved countrymen, 5 September is teacher day.
I also learned a lot from these small children.
For me, there was also 5 September Teachers Day and for me, Education Day was also there.
But this time I have to go for the G-20 Sumit, then I realized that in today's mind, my feeling, I'll make it clear.
The place of the mother in life is the same teacher's place.
And even such teachers have seen that those who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after Rio limpic, all around, Pulela Gopichand ji is discussed.
They are players, but they have presented an example of a good teacher.
I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher from a player today.
And on Teacher's Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication to the game and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
Teacher's contribution in our lives always feels happy.
On September 5, India's former President Dr. Sarvapalli is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates it as a teacher day.
They reached any place in life, but they always tried to live as a teacher.
I also sometimes think, so I remember so many stories of my teachers, because they used to do our zero in our small village.
But I can say today that one of my teachers - now he is 90 years old - even today, his letter comes to me every month.
And even at the age of 90, I am surprised even today that in this state he writes with so beautiful characters and my own characters are very bad, because of which whenever I see someone's good characters, I have a lot of respect in my mind.
You have a photo with your teacher on the NarendramodiApp, there's no incident with your teacher, there's no inspiring thing about your teacher, you must share.
Look, seeing the contribution of teacher in the country with the eyes of the students, it is also very valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh festival is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a rebel and we all want our country, our society, our family, our every person, his life to be uninterrupted.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, remembering Lokmanya Tilak ji is very natural.
The tradition of public Ganesh festival - This is the donation of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh festival, he made this religious occasion a festival of national Jagran.
And through public Ganesh festival, there is a big discussion of questions touching social life. The creation of programs is such that due to which the society gets new oz, new fast.
Even today, public Ganesh festivals have started in every corner of India, not just Maharashtra.
All young people also make enough preparations to do this, enthusiasm is also very much.
And some people have still tried a lot to follow the spirit that Lokmanya Tilak ji had kept.
They keep discussions on public issues, bonds competition, colorful competitions.
It also reveals the issues that touch the society in a artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra Swaraj is our birth-founded right.
Suraj is our priority, can we not give messages about this mantra to the public Ganesh festival
Come on, let me invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of society.
Festival fills new life in the life of the person and society.
Life is impossible without the festival, but according to the time requirement, it also has to be shaken.
This time I have seen that many people have written a lot on those things especially Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
And they are worried about the environment.
Some Sriman Shankar Narayan is Prashant, he has said with great urge that Modi ji, you should explain to the people in the matter of mind that do not use the statues of Ganesh ji made from Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of the village pond
The images made of POP are not favorable to the environment.
They have expressed a lot of pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to you, why do we not use Ganesh's idols, Durga's idols - why do not we come back to our old tradition
Defense of environment, protecting our rivers and ponds, protecting small organisms of this water from pollution in it - this is also God's service.
Ganesh ji is a rebel.
So we should not make such Ganesh ji, who create a disturbance.
I don't know how you will take these things out of me.
Many such institutions, people work very hard for the ganesh of soil, also campaign.
Co-rendly Ganeshotsav - This is also a social service work.
There is time between Durga Pooja.
Now we decide that the idols that our old families used to make, they will also get employment and the pond or the river will be made of soil, then it will go back to it, then the environment will also be protected.
I give you all good wishes of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My beloved countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, on September 4, Mother Teresa will be described as the title of the saint.
Mother Teresa had put her whole life to serve the poor in India.
Those who have served the poor of India throughout the life, when such a mother Teresa receives the title of the saint, it is very natural for all Indians to be proud.
In the ceremony that will be held on September 4, a official delegation will also be sent there by the Government of India, under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj.
From saints, sages, men, great men, every moment we get to learn something or the other.
We will continue to be able to do something, learn something and will continue to do something good.
When my dear countrymen, development becomes public movement, how big change comes
Janshakti is considered to be the form of God.
In the past, the Indian government has made a successful effort to connect people for clean Ganga, for clean Ganga, with the help of 5 state governments.
On 20th of this month, in Allahabad, those people were invited that they were heads of villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were men too, women too.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of the Ganges coast sworn in in the witness of the Ganges that they will immediately stop the tradition of going to the open in their villages of the Ganges coast, will run a campaign to make toilets and the village will fully contribute to the cleaning of the Ganges that the village will not let the Ganges get dirty.
I came to Allahabad for this resolution, someone came from Uttarakhand, someone came from Uttar Pradesh, someone came from Bihar, someone came from Jharkhand, someone came from West Bengal, I congratulate all of them for this work.
I also congratulate all the ministries of the Indian government, congratulate those ministers who have fulfilled this imagination.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all those 5 states that they raised an important step in the cleaning of the Ganges by adding the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me sometimes and those who imagine it also have a special respect in my mind towards those people.
On July 15, more students of more than seventeen-seven schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Somebody wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children from seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it was so effective, so emotional impact that when the second day came to school after receiving the letter, the parents grabbed him a letter to Teacher and in it the parents promised that he would make Toilet till the date of the filing.
Those who came to the imagination, who have done these efforts, also congratulated those students and special enjoyment to those parents who decided to work to make the toilet by taking their child's letter seriously.
That's what inspires us.
Koppal ila of Karnataka, a daughter of sixteen years old Mallamma in this district - this daughter satyagraha against her family.
It is said that he had left the food and he too should not ask for anything for himself, not to bring any good clothes, not to eat any sweets, but to daughter Mallamma's release was that there should be toilet in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, the daughter was stuck on the jurisdiction, she was not ready to leave her Satyagraha.
The village's head Mohammad Shafi, he came to know that Mallamma has Satyagraha for Toilet, then also see the specialty of the village's head Mohammad Shafi, waiting for eighteen thousand rupees and made another toilet within a week.
Look at this daughter Mallamma's life and look at the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
How are the ways opened to solve problems, this is the manpower ID
My dear countrymen, clean India, have become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a resolution.
Some Indians have made it their case.
But everyone is associated with it in any form, everyone is contributing to it.
It will be confirmed and the winners who will be on October 2 on Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can make films from your mobile phone Camera.
Come on, move forward, you have my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried that our relations with our neighbors are deep, our relations are easy, our relations are alive.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President Adriya Pranab Mukherjee started a new program in Kolkata, Akashwani Friendship channel.
Now many people will feel that the President should also inaugurate the Hannel of a radio
But this is not General Radio's fannel, it's a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know, Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So here Akashwani friendship and Bangladesh Beatar, they will share content with each other and on both sides Bengali-speaking people will enjoy Akashwani.
People to People Act has a very big contribution to Akashwani.
President ji launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate Akashwani's friends that they are giving their contribution in foreign policy too.
My dear countrymen, you may have given me the work of the Prime Minister, but in the end I am also a human like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me very much.
Such emotional incidents also give new energy, give new inspiration and this is what inspires people of India to pass something or the other.
In the past, I got a letter that touched my mind.
A 84-year-old mother, who is retired teacher, wrote to me this letter.
If he had not refused to deny me in his letter that never declared my name, then I had the mind that today I would talk to you by giving them names and the letter he wrote that when you had appealed to leave Gas Subsidy, then I had left Gas Subsidy and later I forgot.
For me, the letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than a Padmashree.
Countries, you will know that I have tried to send a letter to those who left the Gas Subsidi, and some of my representatives will go to Rubaru and give them a letter.
I have an attempt to write a letter to more than one crore people.
My letter came to this mother under the same plan, he wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to liberate poor mothers from stove smoke and so I am a retired teacher, in a few years my age will be 90 years, I'm sending you a donation of 50 thousand rupees, so that you can work to free such poor mothers from stove smoke.
You can imagine, as a general teacher, mother passing on retired pension, when gives 50 thousand rupees and poor mothers and sisters to free them from stove smoke and give gas connection.
The question is not of 50 thousand rupees, the question is of that mother's feeling and such a quota mother and sister are their blessings, so that my country becomes confident and powerful for the future.
And he did not write me as the Prime Minister. He wrote a letter directly - Modi Bhaiya
I pray to that mother and also pray to these daughter-in-law mothers of India that those who always do something to do good to someone by suffering from their suffering.
My dear countrymen, due to the famine last year, we were upset, but this month of August was constantly full of flood problems.
There was frequent floods in some parts of the country.
State governments, the central government, the units of the local Swaraj organization, the social institutions, the citizens, have tried their best to do whatever they can.
But even among the news of these floods, there were some news that needed to be more remembered.
What happens to the strength of unity, together, then how big results can be found
This will remember the month of August this year.
In August 2016, there were a lot of parties in the Parliament, almost 90 parties in the country, all the parties, together with the GST passed the law of the GST.
It goes to all parties.
And all parties together walk in one direction, then this is an example of how big work happens.
In the same way, in relation to the situation of Kashmir whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country have talked about Kashmir with a voice.
Message to the world, also gave messages to separatist elements and also expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And we all have the opinion of the people of 100 million people, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, it is a matter of opinion that if anyone knows in Kashmir, whether he is a young man or a security worker, this loss is ours, belongs to your own country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by forwarding these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, full of diversity.
Being a citizen to keep the country filled with diversity in the bond of unity, as a society, as a government, we all have the obligation to give more power to the things that emphasize unity, expose more and then by going, the country can make its wonderful future.
I trust the power of my hundred and fifty million countrymen.
Today, just like that, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, I got an opportunity to spend some moments with the young people of Delhi this morning and I believe that in the coming days, the color of the game in the whole country will color every young man with the color of enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days the world's largest games are going to be Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to grow frequently in our ears.
Our hopes are very much, but the work of encouraging those players, who have been played in Rio, is also of hundreds of millions of countrymen.
Today, the Indian government organized a great event in Run for Reo, Sports and Jio, Sports and Play- A big event.
In the coming days, wherever we are, do something to encourage our players.
No matter how much the joy of eating, everything has to be left.
I'm ready to do this work from your side.
To reach these players your message, the country's Prime Minister is ready to become postman.
If there is no reservoir and innovation, then as the stagnant water spreads dirt, textnology also becomes a burden.
And if we will live without reservoir and innovation, we will become black in the world, changing era, and therefore in the new generation, the reservoir and innovation towards science, Technology and for this the government has also raised many steps.
And so I say - Let us to innovate and when I call Let us to innovate, then my AI
If we have to prepare net generation innovators, then our children will have to join him and therefore the Indian government has taken the initiative of an Atal Tinkaring Habs.
Wherever such teachers in schools will be given 10 lakh rupees and 10 lakh rupees will also be given for maintenance during five years.
If we have strong and prosperous I encounter centers, then for innovation, for start ups, to use it, get a system to bring it to a position.
In the same way India is battling many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we'll have to find technical solutions.
We have called for an Atal Grand Welfare to the young generation of the country that you see the problem, find ways to technology to solve, reserve, innovate and bring.
The Indian government wants to promote special awards to the technology discovered to solve our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worried about the famine and these days the rain is also enjoying, the news of floods is also coming.
The state government and the central government are making a lot of efforts to join the shoulders to help flood victims.
Regardless of some difficulties due to the rain, every mind, every human mind gets complicated, because our entire economic activity is rained in the center-bind, farming.
Sometimes such a disease occurs that we regret the lifetime.
Can be avoided from Engue.
Keep in mind a little cleanliness, be slightly alert and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children and this is not the reason that such a disease occurs in the poor settlement, the case of Engue is not so.
Engue comes first in the dry-green area and so we understand it.
You must have seen advertisement on T, but sometimes we are somewhat indifferent to awareness about it.
Government, hospital, doctor - they will do their work, but we too, in our house, in our area, do not enter the engue in your family and do not get any disease due to water, be cautious for this, I will pray to you.
I'm looking forward to another trouble, dear countrymen, I want to attract your attention.
Life has become so turbulent, so rampant that sometimes we do not have time to think for us.
If you get sick, you feel, get better quickly and so put any antibiotic in the body.
Immediately get rid of the disease, but my beloved countrymen, these ways can create a very serious crisis.
Maybe you get relief for a moment, but stop taking antibiotic without the advice of doctors.
I urge you to complete the course as long as the doctor asked to take
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing such changes in themselves at a fast pace that there is no effect of medicines.
In the medical language, it is called antibiotic resistance and therefore how to use antibiotic, its rules are equally important.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
The mothers who are pregnant in our country, their life is sometimes very worried.
In our country, about 3 crore women pregnancy every year, but some mothers die during delivery, sometimes mother dies, sometimes the child dies, sometimes both the child and mother die.
It is fine that in the last decade, the rate of maternal mortality has decreased, but still a large number of pregnant mothers can not survive.
Blood deficiency during pregnancy or after pregnancy, reproductive infection, high BP - When does not know what problem destroy his life
Keeping these things in mind, the Indian government has started a new campaign for the last few months - Prime Minister safe maternity campaign.
Under this campaign, on 9th of every month, free checks will be done in government health centers of all pregnant women.
Mother and child - both of the life can be saved and I don't mean Gynecologist that you can not provide these services free for poor mothers on 9th day a month.
Can my doctor siblings not apply for this work for the poor for twelve days in a year
I believe you must join.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world-climate change, global warming, environment - makes it great concern.
It is collectively discussed in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized for centuries in India.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also discusses the tree, worrying about the tree in the battlefield also means how much it will be, we can guess.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says - Ashwath: I am peepal in all trees i.e., all trees.
Venus policy states - Nasti roots innumerable - there is no such plant in which there is no medicinal properties.
Who donates the tree, he also wires into the world like a tree child.
Therefore, parents who want their welfare should plant good trees and follow them like their children.
Our scriptures are - Geeta, Venus policy, Mahabharata's discipline festival - but there are some people in today's generation, who show these ideals to live.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came in my mind, she touched my mind.
In the Discipline Festival of Mahabharata, it is said that the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the child in Parlok. Sonal has taken the initiative not only to his parents but to fulfill the wishes of the society.
In the Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, the farmer Khandhu Maruti Mahatra of Narayanpur village, he married his grandson Sonal in a big motivation.
Such a scene touching the mind was in that picture.
Sonal, who is himself a agricultural graduate, came to this idea and gifting mango plants in marriage, see how excellent nature's love appeared.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became a immortal story of nature love. I give Sonal and Mr. Mahatra ji a lot of good wishes for this innovative effort.
And many people use such uses.
I remember, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there comes a large number of pilgrims in the Bhadra month in the temple of Amba ji, once a social activist organization decided that the people who come to the temple will give them a plant in Prasad and they will say that it is the Prasad of Mother, this plant is bigger, the mother will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we ruin our land by putting a fence on the banks of our fields, why not we cultivate timber instead of that fence.
Today, India has to bring billions of people from abroad to build a home, to create aurnitude.
If we plant trees on the edge of our farm, which came into work, then after fifteen-twenty years, you can also sell it from the government's permission and you and they can also become a new means of your income and you can also avoid immortalizing India.
In the past, many states have run a lot of operations using this season, the Indian government also passed an AMPA law, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to go to the tree plantation.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government has planted about two and a half million plants in the entire state on July 1, and next year they have resolved to plant three crore plants.
The government raised a public movement.
Rajasthan, deserted land - so big forest festival and has resolved to plant twenty five lakh plants.
In Rajasthan, twenty five lakh plants are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan know how big they have raised.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover till Twenty-Twenty-Nine (2029).
There is also a very bright tradition of the Forest Festival in Gujarat.
This year Gujarat has taken many such projects as Amra forest, unity forest, martyr forest - in the form of forest festival and has campaigned to plant millions of trees.
I am not able to mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to go to South Arica in the past.
This was my first visit and when there is a foreign trip, it is diplomacy, talk of trade, discussions about security, there are many mos - it is all to happen.
But the journey to South Arica for me was a pilgrimage in a way.
When the soft Arica remembers, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nellson Mandela.
Non-violence, love, forgiveness in the world - when these words fall on the ear, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces appear to us.
Between my soft Arica tour, I went to Pooni Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I - Mahatma Gandhi, who had traveled in the train and the tragedy that had launched a Mohandas to make Mahatma Gandhi, that Peter Vermaritburg station - I also got good luck of that rail journey.
But what I want to tell, I got an opportunity to meet such great feelings this time, who had spent for equality, for the same opportunity, for their young society.
He fought with the shoulder with Nelson Mandela, lived alive with Nelson Mandela in jail for twenty-two, twenty-two years.
In a way, he had sacrificed the whole jawan and I got the privilege of visiting these glory of Sriman Ahmed Katharada, Shriman Lalu Cheba (Loo Heiba), Shriman George Bios, Roni Kasrils.
The original Indians, but where they went, they got there.
On his face, even after doing such a big penance, it was not seen anywhere.
A type of duties - the symptoms of duties that have been described in the Gita, nor did they seem to be absolutely literate.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunities.
There can be no big mantra for any society and government.
Sam-bhav and mama-bhav, these are the ways, which lead us to the bright future.
Children want a good future.
Principle will be different, but the path is the same and that path is of development, equality, equal opportunity, of equality, of mama-bhav.
Let us proud of these Indians who have shown the basic mantras of our life in South Arica.
Being a woman, I'm sorry about her family.
And as Technology is doing a lot of role in the economic system, then those who abuse it also come to the ground.
You may also be sometimes confused and they write you a letter in such a good way, as if it seems, is the right letter.
Any energy sends by making Letter pad, your credit card number, debit card number, and your account is fails through technology.
This is a new way of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I think that this love should be avoided, be cautious and if such false things come, then your men and children should be careful and make them a little aware.
I would like Shilpi Verma to bring good things to me. You will have to do all the experiences, but maybe you will not see so seriously, but I feel that there is a need to see.
My dear countrymen, these days the session of Parliament is going on, I also get an opportunity to meet many people of the country through the session of Parliament.
But these days I have a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The artistic paintings have been done at the station.
Not only that, in the village, the plastic bottles or oil's can lying in such garbage, they searched and collected them and filled them with soil, planting them and making vertical gardens.
And in plastic bottles towards the railway station, making it a virtual garden, it was completely new in a way.
If you ever go to Aligarh, then look at the station.
Nowadays, I am coming from many railway stations in India. Local people are presenting their area on the walls of the railway station by their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of how changes can be brought from public participation.
Congratulations to all working in this way in the country, special congratulations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rains, there is also a lot of festivals in our country.
In the temples, festivals will be celebrated in the worship places and you will also be involved in the festival even in the house, outside.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a special festival of importance here.
Like last year, can not you present the Prime Minister's Security Insurance Scheme or Life Jyoti Insurance Scheme to the mothers and children of your country on the occasion of Rakshabandhan this year
Think, give such a gift to the sister, who really give her protection in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in Azad Hindustan.
75 years of quit India and 70 years of India's independence can give us new inspiration, can wake up new glory, can become an opportunity for resolution to do something for the country.
The whole country will be colored with the color of freedom fighters, and once again feel the joy of freedom all around.
This environment should make us all and the festival of freedom - this is not a government program, it should be of the people of the country.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you will also do something good with the inspiration of patriotism.
Send his picture to the Narendramodi App.
Make an environment in the country.
Dear countrymen, on August 15, I get a good luck to talk to the country with the ramparts of the Red Fort, there is a tradition.
There will also be some things in your mind, which you would like to keep your point from the Red Fort as strong as possible.
I invite you, whatever thoughts you come in your mind, which feels as your representative, as your principal servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write me and send me.
What is spoken from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of two and a half million countrymen.
Let me invite you, let's remind you of the divinities of freedom. Remember the great men who spend their lives for India and go ahead with the resolve to do something for the country.
A lot of bowl to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I am also grateful to Akashwani that he has successfully tried to present this mind in regional languages at 8.00 in the evening.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later, through telephone, through my Gov Website, bring their feelings to me through Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in government work.
With the point of view of public interest, how active the government should be, how important the work of public interest should be, for these things, this relationship with you is very useful.
I hope you will be more active and force it to how democracy goes away from public participation.
The heat is going on increasing.
The maximum part of the country is feeling the heat of heat.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, the trees were cut and in a way human beings destroyed the nature and propagated the path of their own destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions for the environment all over the world, worry.
This time, the nited nations have placed this topic on the zero tolerance for the District Trade on World Environment Day.
It will be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, we have to discuss water, how to increase our forest.
Because you must have seen, in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir - Himalayas, the fire in the forests
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - I could have a meeting of all the drought affected states, but I did not do this.
What states have to say, they listen closely.
Generally, in the government, how much money was spent from the Indian government and how many expenses were spent - it does not talk more closely.
It was also surprising for the officials of our Indian government that many states have made very best efforts, in relation to water, in relation to environment, to deal with drought situation, for animals, for animals, for the affected humans and in a way, in every corner of the entire country, why not the government of any party, it was experienced that this problem, to deal with the long-term situation, what is the permanent solutions, what is the permanent treatment
In a way, he was also the Learning Experience for me and I have told my policy commission how to take the best practices, how to take them in all the states, there should also be any work.
Some states, especially Andhra, have used extensive technology to Gujarat.
I would like to reach the special successive efforts of the states by the Policy Commission forward to us and the states.
Public participation in solving such problems is the basis for a very big success.
As we go to the temple, give some offerings and some of the Prasad falls, then there is anxiety in the mind.
They raise him and ask for forgiveness from God five times.
This water is also the offering of God.
If a drop is also wasted, then we should suffer.
And therefore water conservation also has the same importance, water conservation also has the same importance, water conservation also has the same importance and that is why per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation, at least the crop with water.
Now it is a matter of happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, someone is using drip-irrigation, someone is doing sprinkler.
I sat with the states, while some states also used drip-irrigation for the paddy, they also successfully used the drip-irrigation and due to which their yield also increased, water was saved and wages also decreased.
When I heard from these states, there are many states that have taken very big targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a lot of work in drip-irrigation and they are trying to join two-two, three-three lakh hectares of micro-irrigation every year
If these campaigns go on in all the states, then farming will also benefit a lot, water will also be accumulated.
The brothers of our Telangana have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna river through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh also tried to use technologies in the Neeru Progress Mission, country water recharging.
In the public movement raised by Maharashtra, people are also excusing sweat, giving money.
Watery camp campaign - I really feel this movement will be very useful to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj-Jalasuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has Balram pond scheme - Nearly 22 thousand ponds are not these small statistics .
Rajasthan and Gujarat, where there are more old ages, have launched a big campaign to revive them as a water temple.
Rajasthan has launched Chief Minister Water Suspension Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is a problem of water.
They have launched a big campaign of Heck Com.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have launched a campaign to stop ten to ten, twenty-two kilometers of water by making small dams in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - we decide, one drop of water will not even be wasted.
And it doesn ' t mean any water mean just the subject of farmers .
This village, poor, laborer, farmer, urban, rural, rich and poor - is a matter related to everyone and therefore rainy season is coming, water is our priority and this time when we celebrate Diwali, then enjoy how much water we saved, how much water stopped
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
How amazing is the treasure of God
Media explained in detail the problem of water in the past.
I hope media will guide people towards saving water, run the campaign and become media partners for ever from the water crisis, I also invite them.
My dear countrymen, we have to make modern India.
We have to make Transparent India.
We have to reach many systems from one corner to the other corner of India, then our old habits will also have to change a little.
Today I want to touch a topic on which if you help me, then we can move successfully in that direction.
If you want salt, then give such a vegetable in return.
The business used to run from the barter system.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards Kashles society.
We can also get the money through the electronic technology system, give the money.
You can buy things, you can also square the bill.
And there will be no question of ever being stolen from the tongue.
There will be no concern about keeping accounts, automatic accounts will be there.
The beginning will look a little difficult, but once the habit will take place, then this system will be simple.
And this is because we have started the campaign of Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana these days, banks accounts of almost all families of the country have opened.
So we can move forward to this cashless society, coordinating with public money, base and mobile (JAM), J.A.M.
You must have seen that Rupay card has been given with Jan-han account.
In the coming days, these cards are going to work from both creedit and debit.
To get out of the pocket, count, not needed.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever initiatives the Indian government has taken, how to take money through a PS, how to take money.
It will be very easy to transact money through your mobile phone and it is a matter of happiness that N.P..I.
In a way, the bank has worked at your door - in that direction.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these arrangements and add habits, then we will not need this currency, notes will not be needed, money will not be needed, business will run automatically and due to this a transparency will come.
Look, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands.
Gradually it was habitual, now it can not live without it.
Maybe these cashless society can take the same form, but it will be better if it happens in less time.
My dear countrymen, whenever the limpic games come and when the game starts, then we sit in the head, we're so far behind in the gold medal, didn't get Silver, don't run from Brone, it stays.
To encourage our players going to Rio Limpic, to encourage them, everybody in their own way.
Write a song, create a cartoon, give a good wishes message, encourage any game, but the whole country should create a very positive environment towards our players.
The results that will come - will come.
It becomes very powerful in itself, when the player feels that hundreds of millions of people are standing with him, then he gets encouraged.
The suggestions that came from all over the country, and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of Cootbal has started to appear throughout the country.
Many people are making their own teams with initiative.
I've got thousands of suggestions on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Maybe many people will not have to play, but there is so much interest in the game of thousands of young people in the country, it was a pleasant experience for me in myself.
We know the attachment of cricket and India, but I saw so much at Coutball. It indicates a very happy future in itself.
So in the days to come to create an atmosphere of humor and enthusiasm for all our players, the character of the choice for Rio limpic.
Everything should not be done with the test of victory and defeat.
India made its identity in the world with sportsman spirit.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm and humility towards our sports world partners.
New results are coming from somewhere from the last eight-ten days
I'm talking about students who worked hard for a year, eam gave, 10th, 12th, one after another, a result has started coming.
It is clear that our daughters are showing paracracy.
It's a pleasure.
Those who have succeeded in these results are my best wishes, congratulations.
Those who have not been successful, I would like to say once again that there is a lot to do in life.
If the result has not come according to our wish, then no life is stuck.
Believing should live, should move forward with confidence.
But a big new kind of question has come in front of me and I had never thought about this.
But I was surprised, everyone in the house said this to me, hey, four marks come more, your 90 percent would be.
I mean, my family and my friend, my teacher - no one was happy with my 89.33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, yeah, your 90 percent remained for four marks.
Now I can't understand how I handle such a situation.
Is this all in life
Wasn't that good what I did
Did I even get some less
I don't know, I feel a burden on my mind.
Gaurav, I have read your letter very carefully and I think, perhaps this pain will be not only of you, but of millions of students like you, because an environment has become that instead of satisfaction, it is the second form of negativeness.
We can never take society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction from everything.
It would have been good, your family, your colleagues, friends would have appreciated your 89.33 percent, then you would like to do something more yourself.
Santosh Giri Goswami has also written to me from Jodhpur, almost in the same way.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I do not remember the poem completely, but I had read a long time ago, a poet had written that I made paintings on the life of life.
Would that a single audience had also shed tears on the picture of my pain.
These were the words of poems, I have not remembered this now, but if there is a lot of earlier poem, then the feeling was this.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will tell you so much that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, listen, but stay firm on your point of view and also try to do something better.
But you will not satisfy what has been found, then you will never be able to build a new building
The foundation of success is the basis of great success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success can not make the staircase of success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
But I want to say this to the neighbors and parents and companions that you do not impose your expectations on them by pleading with your children.
And friends, have you ever failed in life, would he live
Who can never bring good marks in Jeam, he goes a long way in the spots, goes forward in music, goes forward in the art worker, goes ahead in business.
God has given a wonderful legislation to everyone.
Just recognize your inner strength, emphasize it, you will go ahead.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santur.
There was a time, the Santoor instrument was connected to the Lock Music in the Valley of Kashmir.
But a Pandit was Shiv Kumar, who put him in hand and today made an important instrument in the world.
Shahnai - Shahnai was at a limited place in the entire area of our music.
Most of the kings and princes used to have their place on the gate.
But when Ustad Bismilla Khan handled Shahnai, today became the best instrument of the world, it has become a identification.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that what is spent on health of our poor families, it imbalances the track of life.
And it is true that the cost of not being ill is very low, but after being sick, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life so that there is no disease, there is no financial burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for prevention of cleanliness disease.
If someone can do the worst service, you can do cleanliness.
And the other for which I constantly request, that's yoga.
Some people call him yoga too.
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction towards yoga in the whole world, faith is also and the world has accepted it.
We have an unimportant gift given to our ancestors, which we have given to the world.
The power of living a balanced life gives yoga to the stress-affected world.
Prevention is better than the time. Staying healthy in the life of a person connected with yoga, being rich in strong will and power, being full of unprecedented self-concentration, concentration in every work - these easy achievements are available.
June 21 - Yoga Day, this is not just one event, its business increased, its place in every person's life, every person spent 20 minutes in his daily routine, 25 minutes, 30 minutes for yoga.
And for this, Yoga Day inspires us on June 21.
And sometimes collective environment causes changes in the life of the person.
Look at him, get him in your village, get him in your neighborhood, get him in your city, in your school, in institutment, in the live offices.
Start a month from now on, look, you will become partner on June 21.
I have read many times that as soon as Regularly meets in many offices, yoga and pranayama are collective, then the eiciency of the whole office increases so much, the cluster of the entire office changes, the efficiency changes.
You must also join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
You do not stay behind anywhere, this is my request.
Staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.
I'm constantly connecting with you through my beloved countrymen, mind.
Dear Countries, you all bow down again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Namaste.
Talk of mind, April 2016
Please replace this condition, Ravi has expressed great anger, but I believe that he is probably not angry with me, angry at the situation. You will remember, the former President of India, Dr.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that publish only positive news on the first page of the newspaper, they used to say this continuously. A few days ago, a newspaper had written a letter to me. They had said that we have decided that on Monday we will not give a single negative news, "Positive will be informed." These days I have seen something, T.
This time too I saw that many letters, comments, phone calls have all the stories, suggestions, inspirations are everybody wants to do something or the other and also wants to say, and there is a lot of things in them, which I would like to beat, but, there is time limit, so I can not even be accumulated.
You will remember last time I had talked about a book of Premchand ji's stories and we had decided to share some things with everyone through the Narendramodi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people shared information about many types of books
I like people are discussing things written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, corruption, life character, many such subjects.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many more books
But one thing I have to admit is that I can ' t give time to read a lot of books .
But a advantage has been needed, that if you write and send, I'm getting an opportunity to know about many books.
But what this is, the last one month's experience, I think we have to move it forward.
Why shouldn't we make a permanent books corners on the Narendramodi app and whenever we read the new book, write about it there, discuss and you can also subscribe a good name for our books corners
Parents, it seems that water conservation - When I touched this thing in the matter of mind, but perhaps today I am feeling that water conservation was a matter of touching your heart even before I said it was a favorite subject of normal humanity.
And I am feeling that the hearts of India have been shouting about water these days .
Water conservation, many widows, effective efforts are going on across the country
People have made information about traditional methods
Media has started many innovative campaigns on water conservation
Government, are NSG- Something at war level
Seeing the potential of collectivity, the mind looks very happy, it is very satisfactory
Villagers donated labor and worked to give a certain direction to the waterfall flowing from the mountain
That too pure country way
This has not only stopped soil cutting and waste of crops, but the fields are also getting water.
You will also be very happy to know that the beautiful state of North East Meghalaya has become the first state in the country, which has prepared its water system, water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, the cultivation of those crops is being promoted, which require less water and there is no harm to the farmer.
I would like to congratulate the Haryana government especially that they communicated with the farmers, motivated them from traditional farming, for less water crops.
And the time of the festive season will come .
On the occasion of festivals many fairs are also held .
Why not use these mails for water conservation
People from all sections of society arrive in the fairs
We can give the message of saving water in these fairs very effectively, exhibition can dramatic, we can easily access the message of water conservation along with festivals.
Parents, some things fill us with enthusiasm and especially children's achievements, their exploits, give us new energy and therefore, today me, some children think of talking about, and these children are funds Baipotu, Monisha Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Prati Nag, Athrva Deshmukh, Aronesh Ganguly and Hrithik Alamanda.
You will also be proud and joyful of what I'll tell about them.
We all know that cancer is a word that threatens the whole world
It seems, stands at the death gate, but all these ten children have not only defeated cancer, cancer, but have illuminated the name of India in the whole world with their exploits.
In sports, we often see that players become champions after winning or making medals, but this was a rare opportunity, where these people were champions before participating in the sports competition and that too the champion of the war of life
Actually, in Moscow this month, Lord Children's Women's Games was organized.
This is a unique spots tournament in which Young cancer savers i.e. those who have come out fighting cancer in their lives, they take part.
In this competition, competitions like Shooting, Sheess, Swimming, Running, Cotball and Table Tennis were organized.
All these ten champions of our country won the medal in this tournament
Some of these players won medals in more than one game .
Actually, with the point of view of space, 2019 has been a very good year for India
Our scientists, in March, had done A-Sat launch and after that there was not much discussion of big and important news like A-Sat at that time in the implication of the Candiian-two election.
While we got the ability to kill Satelite, three-seven kilometers away from A-Sat missile, just three minutes.
India, who achieved this achievement, became the fourth country of the world and now, on July 22, the whole country, with pride, saw how Chandrayaan-two moved towards space from Sriharikota to space.
Pictures of launch of Bhandriyaan-two filled the countrymen with pride and joy, happiness
Bhandriyaan-two, this mission is special in many ways
Bhandriyaan-two, will make our understanding more clear about the moon
This will give us information more detailed about the moon, but if you ask me what two big lessons have been received from Candriyaan-two, then I will say, these two are learning Aith and Heralessness i.e. faith and fearlessness.
We should trust our talents and capacities, your talent and ability
You will be happy to know that Handriyan-two is completely covered in Indian color
It is Indian from heart and spirit
is a completely indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when things have to go through something new in the new area, ID
Just as our scientists, in the record time, by one day and night, all the technical issues were launched by handryan-two, she is unprecedented in herself.
This great penance of scientists was seen by the whole world
Many of us must be proud of this , and , despite the disruption , they have not changed the time to reach , but it is surprising .
We also have to face temporary set backs i.e. temporary difficulties in our life, but always remember, the ability to overcome it is also within us.
Through the point of mind today, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the country's students friends, with young colleagues, and I invite the youth and women of the country to a ui competitive
I request young colleagues, students, to participate in this ui competitiveness and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your stake,
I urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers, especially to work hard to make their school victorious
These victorious students will have a historical event of their life, but for this, you have to take part in the ui competitiveness, you have to get the highest points, you have to be victorious
My dear countrymen, you must have done a thing
The words of our mind have accelerated the cleanliness drive from time to time and in the same way efforts being made to hygiene have always inspired the mind .
The journey started five years ago today with the participation of the people, is setting up new standards of cleanliness
It is not that we have achieved ideal situation in cleanliness, but the way in which cleanliness campaign has been achieved from public places, it is the power of the resolve of one and a half million countrymen, but we are not going to stop so much.
This movement has now moved towards the beauty of cleanliness .
Just a few days ago I was watching the story of Sriman Yogesh Saini and his team in Media .
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative of making Delhi clean, not clean, but beautiful.
He started with his team with the trash of Lodhi Garden
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi worked to decorate and decorate with beautiful paintings
From the walls of Ver Bridge and school to slums, they started crushing their skills, people also got together and in a way this process was going on.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with strong paintings during the Kumbh
There is no voice in color and lines, but the message of those pictures made from them proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of cleanliness campaign.
We need a lot to have a cluster to make wealth in our society .
Tell us in a way, then we have to move forward to make the waste from the waste
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on My Gov
This Comment was from Muhammad Aslam, brother of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He likes to listen to the talk of the mind
I am happy to say that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobilitation Programme - Back to Filage in my state Jammu and Kashmir
This program was organized in June,
I think such programmes should be organized every three months
At the same time, the program should also be arranged for online monitoring.
With my opinion, this was his kind, such a first program, in which the public directly interacted with the government
Bhai Muhammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it , my eagerness to know about Back to Filage Programme increased and when I went in detail about it , I felt that the whole country should also be aware of it .
This program shows how desperate the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development, how excited they are.
In this program, for the first time, big officers who reached the villages directly, those who had never seen the villagers, they themselves reached their doors so that the obstacles in the work of development can be understood, problems can be overcome.
This program lasted a week and in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state government officials informed the villagers in detail of government schemes and programs
How can Panchayats be strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of ordinary humans  The villagers also openly told their problems .
Parents, these programs were not a government dinner that the officials returned to the village throughout the day, but this time the officials spent two days and one night in Panchayat, they got an opportunity to spend time in the village.
Many more things were also included to make this program interesting .
Sports competition was done for children under Sports India
The same spots kits, job cards of MNREGA and SST certificates were also distributed
People of Kashmir became participants of this festival of development
The pleasure is that the Back to Dilage program was organized in remote villages, where the government officials had to travel on foot for one day, one and a half days by climbing the hills through remote routes.
Many officers were so impressed with their reception that they stayed in villages for more than two days .
To organize village meetings in these areas, participation of a large number of people in it and preparing plans for themselves, it is very pleasant.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstruction, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions
My beloved countrymen, honored with the Gyanpeeth award, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra has presented the glory of the month of Savan in one of his poems.
People from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Savan in their own way throughout India.
In this season , whenever we see around us , it seems as if the earth had covered the green sheet .
All around, a new energy starts transmitting
In this holy month, many devotees go to Kanvad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and await festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami, eagerly.
During this time, the festival of defense bonds also comes to the symbol of brother and sister's love.
When the month of Savan, you will be very happy to know that this time the most devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
Since July 1, more than three lakh pilgrims have already visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the pilgrims who had joined this journey for 60 days in 2015, have joined this time only 28 days.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I specially want to praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests and their guests.
Those who come back from the journey, they become convinced of the hot and self-reliance of the people of the state
All these things are going to prove to be very beneficial for tourism in future .
I have been told that since this year's Chardham Yatra has started in Uttarakhand, more than 8 lakh devotees have been visiting Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
After the severe disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you to go to those parts of the country, whose beauty is seen during monsoon
To see this beauty of your country and understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and travel, maybe there can be no bigger teacher than this.
My, you all wish that this beautiful and alive month of Sawan will communicate new energy, new hopes and new hopes in all of you
In the same way , leave India in the month of August and remember it .
I would like to make some special preparations on August 15 to seek a new way to celebrate this festival of Independence .
This is the time when heavy rains are occurring in many parts of the country
Well, when we see TO, the same aspect of rain appears on all sides flood, flooded water, traffic jam
The second picture of the monsoon in which our farmer, shouting birds, flowing waterfalls, green sheet covered earth, you will have to come out with the family to see it.
Rain, freshness and happiness i.e. Reshness and appenses both bring with you, I want this monsoon to continue to fill you with happiness
My dear countrymen, you all have a lot of blessings
Today the people of the Christian community are celebrating Caster.
I give all the people the best wishes of Caster's streams.
And for some people, it'll also be criteria that on one side Jeam and on the other side T-20 reality orlld up. Even today, maybe you'll wait for India and Australia's match.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
There's a good moment.
Today when Australia and India are going to play, I give my best wishes to the players of both teams.
65 percent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports, nothing is made.
Time is, the period of a new revolution in sports.
24 teams of the world are coming to play in India.
In 1951, 1962 Asian Games, India won the gold medal and India was fourth in 1956 lympic Games.
But unfortunately in the last few decades, we walked on the lower pyre, left behind, fell, fell.
Cootball is an opportunity. Can you give me your suggestions
I believe a huge opportunity to brand India globally.
I assume the opportunity to identify India's youth power, what was found in the middle of Match, not in that sense.
Through the preparation of this messenger, we can decorate our strength, express power and we can also brand India's Branding.
Can you send me your suggestions on this, NarendramodiApp
You must have thought of tourism in my beloved students, holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time too I had urged you to upload photos from where you go.
People, language, eating and drinking do not know what they can see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you go out to see you will be watching the whole life, you will be watching
Never mind and I am lucky I have got a chance to travel a lot.
When the Chief Minister was not, he was not the Prime Minister and was young like you, I traveled very much.
I think it's a good mark.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope you can contribute something to cleanliness when you go to these holidays
Maybe it's not happening in a very scientific way but it's happening.
Can you also emphasize cleanliness on tourism destination as a tourist
I believe my young man will definitely help me in it.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
But we decide that if we have to emphasize our tourism, we can attract the world.
Can attract a large part of the world's tourism to us and provide employment opportunities to millions of young people in our country.
There are governments, institutions, society, citizens, we all have work to do this together.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, holidays come and go, I do not like this thing.
You also think in this direction.
Will you let your holidays, important years of life and its important time go like this
I have a idea to think about you.
Can you resolve to add a new thing to your personality, a honor in holidays, can you
If you don't come to swim, then you can resolve in holidays, I learn to swim, if you don't want to walk a bike, then fix the holidays and run a cycle.
Even today, I type the computer with two fingers, would I learn typing
How many types of skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why do we not divide our powers
Now think and no one wants a trainer in it, needs very big jewels, it's not like a big budget.
You also assume in your neighborhood, you decide that I will make the best out of the waste.
See something and start making it out of it.
Namasta Prime Minister, you said in the holidays of the last summer that the birds also get heat, so we should keep in a vessel in water and put it in our garland or roof, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and enjoyed me, this excuse me was friends with many birds.
I request you to repeat this work back in the matter of mind.
And I did not mind that today I will say something on this subject but that episode reminded me that last year I am in the utensil of soil outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I want to thank Abhi Chaturvedi for a child.
He called me and remembered a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friend.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved those birds very much.
He wrote in his poem - You will not let go away, fill the egg with donations and fill the senses, we will fill the sweet-sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I also congratulate Abhi and thank you for reminding me of very important things.
Shilpa Cook from Mysore, he has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
They have said that the sellers come to our house, the sellers come to the news, the postman comes.
Sometimes those who sell some utensils pass through there, those who sell clothes pass.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer days
Have we ever watered him
Shilpa I am very grateful to you, you kept a very sensitive subject in a very simple way.
This thing is true, but between the heat, if Postman came to the house and how much we would like to drink water.
Well in India this is the nature.
But Shilpa I am grateful that you subserved these things.
What is the situation of the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the round of good crop these days, what are the medicines suitable
Not only this, there is a button in it that which directly connects you with agricultural scientists, connects with the epert.
If you keep your question in front of him then he answers, explains, you do.
I hope my farmer brother and sister download this farmer's facility to App on their mobile phone.
Try then what comes your work from it
And still feels some deficiency, then you also complain to me.
But we also have to think of the countrymen that what will happen without water
Do these times we stop coming off of our pond, water flowing in our ponds, which are the ways of water coming in the ponds, where the garbage or some engroachment occurs, and due to which the water-circulation is gradually decreasing.
Can we excavate those old places once again, clean up and prepare for more water supply
If the water is saved, even if the water is saved in the first rain, the ponds are filled, our rivers are filled with drains, sometimes the rain is stopped, then our loss is reduced.
This time you have seen 5 lakh ponds, farms and ponds.
MNREGA has also emphasized on creating Assets for water supply.
There will be many such villages in the country, there will be many progressive farmers, many such aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more ertilier has made our land ill with mother and we are the sons of mother, children, how can we see our land mother sick
This is also the same as the Certilier, why not be the best Certilier, but if you use more than the extent, then it will become the reason for waste.
The more the water will survive, the more the life will survive.
My dear countrymen, on April 7, Lord Health Day and this time the world has concentrated Lord Health Day on this theme.
Diabetes is such a host that he is inspired to host every disease.
Once diabetes enters, a lot of diseases behind him enter the body, Kurupi guests in his house.
It is said that in 2014 there were about six crore diabetes patients in India.
The reason for 3 percent death is that diabetes was found.
And diabetes has two types, one Type-1, Type-2. Type-1 constitutes, hasreditary, parents have so the child.
And due to Type-2 habits, due to age, due to obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, so 7 Tariq has been kept in the World Health Day.
We all know that our live style is the biggest reason for him.
Body labor is decreasing.
The name of sweat is not quiet, it is not going to walk.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in your personal life by taking some inspiration from 7th, right
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't make comfortable medical check-ups.
And then, after it's very bad, that's okay. I was too old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was small, I was afraid to hear the name of the TB.
But the number of TB patients is very much compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that it can be checked soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this direction.
If you check once.
And this disease can go.
Just get the right treatment and the treatment continues till the disease is destroyed.
I'll urge you to defeat whether TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But it does not happen to the government, the doctor, the medicine till you do it.
And so I urge my countrymen to defeat the diabetes, we get rid of the TB.
My dear countrymen, there are many important opportunities in the month of April, especially on April 14, Bhimrao Baba Sahib Ambedkar's birthday.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am lucky that I am getting the privilege of going to Baba Sahib Ambedkar's birthplace on April 14 this year.
Baba Sahib has given us a lot to become a better citizen.
By walking on that path, becoming an excellent citizen of that path, we can give him a great tribute.
In a few days, Vikram Samvat will start.
Different states are celebrated separately.
Everyone has very good wishes for my new year.
You can hear at your time.
You can hear your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
The youth of India takes time to see the T to get information about him.
Perhaps there will be no history of India, where I have not got an opportunity to go.
Like before, he does not go on the same route, he wants to do something new, he wants to see something new.
And there's a lot of employment through Tourism.
And the identity of your personality will increase so much from it and your confidence will increase.
This will probably be a matter of talking to your colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download it in your mobile phone through this farmer facility app, then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture, whiteer related information in your palm.
My farmer brothers and sisters, have been an opportunity for summer holidays, but for the farmer, there is a chance to excuse more sweat.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer tries to prepare his farm, so that he does not want to waste one drop of rain.
For the farmer, the time to start the season of the farmer is very important.
Doesn't the same food look bad
You must worry about her.
But when TB and death were added, we were afraid but now we have become unaware of the TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
You must have listened to my mind on the radio, but the mind will be on the fact that the children's eam is starting, some people's tenth-twelfth zeam is probably starting on March 1.
So the same thing will happen in your mind.
I also want to join you in your visit.
I'm as worried as much as you're concerned about your children's eam.
But if we change Eam's way to see the examination, then maybe we can be anxious.
I had said in the last mind that you must send your experience, your suggestions to Narendra ModiApp.
I am happy that the teachers have been very successful, whose career is being done by such students, parents, some thinkers of the society have sent me a lot of things by writing.
The second thing came in thousands of things that I believe that this is probably a very important subject.
But most of us have limited the subject of Eam to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
The suggestions that came on my App, it seems that these topics of students should continue to be discussed in a very big, whole nation.
I want to talk to my mind today, especially with parents, with the test takers and their teachers.
I will also tell some of what I have heard, what I have read, what I have been told.
Something I think I will add.
But I believe that for those students who have to give eam, they will be very useful for me 25-30 minutes, this is my opinion.
I want to tell you what they have sent to India's youth, such Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tendulkar, whom they have sent: - Namaskar, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know we're gonna start in a few days.
Many of you will also have tense.
My only message is that your parents will do with you, your teachers will do, your remaining family members will do, friends.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask how your preparation is going on, how many percent will score you.
I would like to say that you'll set some targets for yourself, don't come in the preservation of someone else's execution.
You must work hard, but set a realistic family target for yourself and try to take care of that target.
So I needed to put a solution in for this.
And that's the same targets I always tried to achieve.
My cocus lived on the bulle and the targets themselves became self-sloly-sloly achieveve.
I'll tell you that it's very important to have your thinking positive.
Prostitute thinking will follow.
So you must be positive and the upwards must give you good results, this is me, it's hopeful and I would like to give you best wishes for Eams.
Friends, see what leopards are saying.
Don't press them under the burden of execution.
You have to make your future.
You decide your goal, decide your own target - free mind, free thinking, free strength.
Why not competitive
Why should we waste our time to fight others
Why do not we fight ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our previous records
You see, you will not be able to stop anybody from moving forward and when you break your own record, you will not be expecting anybody else for satisfaction.
Santosh will appear from within one.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a game of points.
Where'd you reach, how much
Do not be stunned in that account.
Life should be linked to any great purpose.
One should walk with dreams, should be resolved.
These tests, they're not right if we're going, they're calculating it.
And therefore, if they are dreaming, then the examination will become a joyful festival in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great purpose.
Every success will become key to achieving that great objective.
Let's take a very big purpose and sometimes there will be less than expected, then disappointment will not come.
And to embarrass, and to embrace, and to try.
Thousands of people have written me on my App from the mobile phone.
Shreya Gupta has emphasized that there is a healthy mind in the healthy body.
Keep in mind your health as well as your studies, so that you can write healthyly in Jeam.
Now I will not say today on the last day that you start penalties and go to run three kilometers, five kilometers.
But one thing is true that what's your routine in the days of Eam especially.
Anyway, 365 days our routine should be conducive to our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with one thing of Shriman Prabhakar Reddy ji. They have urged to sleep on time and revision should rise early in the morning.
Entry to the Demination Center and with other things should be reached before time.
This thing has been said by Prabhakar Reddy ji, I do not dare to say, because I am slightly apathetic about sleep and my coffee friends also complain to me that you sleep very little.
This is my deficiency, I will also try to fix it.
Determined sleep time, deep sleep - This is as important as your activities and activities throughout the day and this is possible.
Otherwise some people are habitual, they keep talking on a long-term telephone before sleeping.
And when I talk of sleeping, don't think I'm asking to sleep for Eam.
I'm talking about sleeping for a stress-free situation to give you a good test at the time of Jeam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it is not so that the marks should come down and ask the mother why the son, if the son came down, then say that Modi ji had asked to sleep, then I was asleep.
Will you not do that
I won't believe you.
Even in our body, one-and-a-half of our body, one-and-a-half part of our body, you must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable.
Not only that, our routine is also crushed.
And so we don't think of anything small.
You see, do not trap yourself in the habit of doingcompromise in what you are ever determined.
Decid, look at it.
You must have seen these two types of people.
The paper which comes in the tension also has a negative effect on its results.
On Vishwanathan Anand, he will tell his experience.
You must have seen, their eyes do not even go around.
Never we used to listen, the incident of Arjun's life that he looked at the bird's eyes.
Just likewise, when Visvanathan sees playing, his eyes are completely on a big target and he is evident of the internal peace.
It is true that someone should say, so the peace inside will come again, it is difficult to say, but it should be tried.
If you are not talking to friends or are walking alone, they are walking, they are walking, they are shaking lots of books, then they can not be calm.
You imagine that you stand on the edge of a pond and looks very good things below.
But suddenly, if a stone starts moving in water and water, then what kind of good looked below, what does it seem
If the water is calm, then things are seen as deep as it is.
But if the water is disturbed, then nothing is seen below.
A year's hard work has been filled, but if there's a strange mind, you'll not find the treasure.
If you have a calm mind, then it will emerge from your treasure and your eam will become very simple.
So sometimes I try to understand more concentrated, so I feel tension inside.
Then I think, no, no, I'll relax a little, so I'll be nice.
So I have myself adopted your Technique.
Very deep breathing.
I take deep breath.
Three times and five times I take deep breath, time goes 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my mind is completely calm and ready to understand things.
Maybe, this is my experience, you can also work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If parents are also read in the house and even if there are teachers in it, then they write the entire paper again, tell what you wrote, what happened
Yeah, I made a mistake.
Hey, man, I knew it, but I didn't remember.
We suck in it.
Fresh the memories of old laughing and joy.
Sometimes you have gone somewhere with your parents, remember the scenes there.
Just leave them and spend half an hour.
The matter of Rajat ji is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting him in the present context, is trying to reach this rites Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also thankful to worshiping Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
I am seeing that this time the people who have told me their experiences have discussed yoga.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that these days I meet someone in the world, why not get a little time, somebody does something about yoga.
Well, friends, I will say just today, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But whatever yoga does, it is at least eam, so do not do this today, do not do it.
Do it then.
But it is true that the student is in life or a half of life, yoga in the development journey of interpretation is a very big knife.
Simple key is simple.
You must pay attention to him.
Yes, if you will be aware of any yoga near you, ask them if you have not done the first yoga in the days of Eam, even then two or four things will tell you, which you can do in two to five minutes.
Look, if you can
Yeah, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young colleagues, you're very quick to go to the examination hall.
Why do these things in the hurry
Why should not you manage your entire day time so that if you stay in traffic, even then we will reach the time.
Otherwise such things create a new tension.
And one thing, we've got the time, the question paper that is instructions, we sometimes feel that it will eat our time.
This is not so friends.
You read those instructions simultaneously. Two minutes and five minutes, there will be no harm.
But with the same paper again with self-confidence, now I have this paper, no new questions are coming, I have to deal with so many questions and when I started thinking again, he wrote that I understood this paper so easily, for the first time I felt that I do not come, but I did not read the same thing again, I did not remember that No question has been kept from other ways, but this is the same thing that I know.
It is very important to understand questions.
Do not understand questions, sometimes the question seems difficult.
I emphasize Yash Nagar that you read questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match him with what you know. You see, it will be easy before writing the question.
It is a matter of happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our very respected scientist CNR Rao have emphasized on patience.
In very few words, but we have given a very good message to all the students.
What I take half an hour to say, they say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am very thankful to Rao Sahib that he inspired the children of the country.
What they have said is firmness, loyalty, penance, this is the same thing dedication, determination, deligence.
If you stay away, then you will also be scared.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do good.
Now a message on my app, Dabus has shared his eam eperience.
He said that there is a continuous effort to create a positive atmosphere at the time of Eam in his family and this discussion was also done in his fellow families.
Together the positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji also said, the positive approaches, positive room of mind positive energy.
Why do not you be at any stage of life, best examples, truth incidents also give great inspiration, gives a lot of strength and makes a new way at the time of crisis.
We all read about the inventor Thomas Elva Edison of the Delectricity Bulb, in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb illuminates even the life of our people.
This is called, the failure also contains the possibility of success.
J.K. Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved anytime.
Harry Potter series is popular worldwide today.
But it was not so from the beginning.
How many problems they had to suffer.
Roling himself had said that in difficulties, all the energy used to be used in that work, which really meant for them.
Ham nowadays becomes not just a student, but of the whole family and of the whole school, Teacher.
But without the support system of parents and teachers alone students, the situation is not good.
Teacher, partenants, ever sincere conditions, together with all this, we become a team, with the same thinking of becoming a unit, go ahead with planned methods, then the examination becomes simple.
Shriman Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on App, he has complained that the parents should never put pressure on their children to demand more marks.
Just encouraging to prepare.
They should be relaxed, worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not burden the children with their expectations.
This is right.
I don't want to say more to the parents today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he is talking to any of his friends, do not stop.
Build a light and slight environment, create a positive environment. Look, your son or daughter will come to condenses.
We like to join him.
We also want to move forward with science.
Curiosity is the birth of science.
Knowledge, science, technology should all these things become easy part of our development journey and this time theme of National Science Day is Make in I
Friends, sometimes successes are very late and when success comes, then the view of seeing the world also changes.
Maybe you might have been very busy in Eam, so maybe you haven't got a lot of news in your mind.
But I want to repeat this to the countrymen too.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a very big and important sports in science world.
The world's scientists laboured, the generations came, did something or the other, and almost a success took place after 100 years.
Gravitational waves from the men of our scientists, he was exposed, detected.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only certifies the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the last century, but is considered a great discovery for Physics.
This whole human species is about to work all over the world, but as an Indian, we all are happy that in the process of searching all the prophets of our country, the honourable scientists of our country were also associated with it.
I want to congratulate all those scientists today, please.
Even in the future, our scientific efforts will be made to pursue this food.
There is such a system in two places in the world, India is the third.
By joining India, this process will get more new power, and new speed will be available.
India will surely become an active partner in the process of this greatest scientific treasure of human welfare among its limited resources.
I once again congratulate all the scientists, give good wishes.
My dear countrymen, I write a number, you can listen to my mind from this number by missed call tomorrow, you can also listen to your mother tongue.
I also have to give eam tomorrow.
Twenty-two million countrymen are going to take my eminence.
But, you must have seen, I must have heard, how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Just, get my eam tomorrow, get yourself started.
And if we are all successful, then the country will also succeed.
So, guys, you too have great good wishes, a lot of good wishes.
Stay away from the stress of success and failure, move ahead of the free mind, stay away.
Talk of mind, December 2015
I look at this portal, Mr. Ganesh V from Pune.
No, we have to make changes to him according to India's needs. The poor person wages somewhere, he gets physical labor, but by a young man innovation, makes such things that the poor get a little facility in the wages. I also consider it as a start-up. I will ask the bank to help such a young man, I will also tell him that go ahead with courage. Market will be found in the same way what is the intellect of our young generation in some cities
Then I thought in my mind that by the eye we feel that he is disabled, but the experience feels that he has any Etra Pover, Additional Shakti. And then I have thought in my mind, why should we use the Divine word in place of disabled in our country, these are those people who have a part or more than one, in which Divine Shakti is transmitted, which we do not have the common body, I like this word  Is my countrymen very much to popularize the word Divyang in place of degradation
Send me to this portal I would sure what I think of the young generation of my country's duty, I want to give a small suggestion. When we celebrate Republic Day on January 26, can we wait for the citizens, through the children of the school-college, the number of great men in our city, the cleaning of the premises, the best cleanliness, the best hygiene, the best comfort for the 26th January
Dear countrymen, Namaste.
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated holidays very well.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And trade employment will also have started with new enthusiasm.
On the other hand Christmas preparations must have started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes the festival comes to work to fill the wound, and sometimes the festival gives new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes in this time of the festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
News of natural disaster comes continuously from every corner of the world.
Never heard or never thought, such natural disasters are reported.
We are now feeling how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
In our own country, the way in which the high rainfall and that too untimely rainfall and long rainfall, especially in Tamil Nadu, has been affected and the states have also affected it.
Many people died.
I express my condolences to all those families in this crisis hour.
State governments gather with full power in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works together with shoulders.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I believe that despite this crisis on Tamil Nadu's power, he will continue to move forward once again at a very fast pace. And he will continue to play his role in moving forward the country.
But when they look at the problems around us, we have needed to make a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, natural calamity used to be part of an agricultural department, because then more natural calamities i.e. famine was limited to here.
Today its form has changed.
After Nepal earthquake, I spoke to Pakistan's Prime Minister Shriman Nawaz Sharif.
A good start has happened.
I got the phone of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab district Jalandhar.
We do organic farming here and also guide many people about farming.
I have a question that the people who set fire to these fields, how to guide the paw or the shrub of wheat to the people, how bad are the microbial bacteria that are on the mother, and what these pollution is happening in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab. How will it get relief from it
Lakhwinder Singh ji was very happy to hear your message.
One is Anand that you are a biological farming farmer.
And they do organic farming themselves, not only that, you understand the problem of farmers properly.
And your concern is correct but this is not the only thing happening in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of people throughout India and traditionally we go on the way to burn the remains of our crop in the same way.
Secondly, what are the measures that are not even training.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come towards the cities, a little sound was heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves have a biological fertilizer.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the earth is burnt.
For my farmer brother and sister, think that our bones are strong, our heart is strong, Kidney is good, everything is good but if the skin above the body is burnt then what will happen
In the same way, these remains of the crop do not burn only by burning the thumb, this earth is burnt to the skin of the mother.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes our original land towards death.
And therefore, his positive efforts should be made.
Once again, this thunderstorm was buried in the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if a pit is stacked in a pit and put a little water in it, then it comes out of the best type of organic fertilizer.
I once got an opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivate banana.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crop was over, he used to spend 5 thousand, 10 thousand, 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the banana which used to live.
And till the people who picked up him did not come with the tractor-wictor, they remained the same.
But some farmers provoked 66, 8-8 inches of that lime and dumped it in the ground.
So the experience came that there is so much water in the thorn of this banana that where it is buried, there is a tree, there is a plant, there is a crop, then it does not need to get out for three months.
Who had to spend the first cleaning of the thumb, today the demand for the thumb has increased.
How big a small experiment can also benefit, this is not less than our farmer brother any scientist.
Dear countrymen will remember the whole world on December 3 I International Day of Persons with Visabilitis.
Last time in the matter of mind, I discussed the rgan violence.
I had also discussed NET's helpline for Craign Connaissance and I was told that there was about 7 times increase in phone calls after that thing of the mind.
Many famous people, including film actress Raveena Tandon, are associated with it.
Crgan violence can save valued lives.
Angadan comes with immortality in a way.
When part goes from one body to another, then that part gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation from this
I believe that widespread awareness will increase in this area and in the true sense, the needy will get better help from the needy, because these help can not be received from anywhere until no one donates.
As I told earlier, on December 3, it is celebrated as a disabled day.
Physically and mentally disabled, they are also rich in an unprecedented courage and potential.
Sometimes pain occurs when sometimes they laugh.
Sometimes the sense of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our eyes, change the view of looking at them, then these people can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to pass.
If we get a little trouble, we sit to cry.
Then remember that my crisis is very small, how does it live
And so all these are the sources of inspiration for us.
Their resolve power, the way to struggle with their lives and the way to convert the crisis into power is also capable.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 years of age.
In 1996 Kashmir, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists.
I lost a part of the intestine and intestine.
Serious Natuur's spinal injury.
The ability to stand on his feet went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
Terrorism injury could not even touch them.
His own word, but the biggest thing is that without any reason a innocent person has suffered such a big problem, the youth has been in danger, but no resentment, no anger, Javed Ahmed also changed this crisis into condolences.
He offered his life to social service.
The body does not support but for 20 years they have been drowned in children's studies.
How did the physically handicapped people improve the interstructure
In public places, how to develop arrangements for disability in government offices
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I specially remember Javed Ahmed's life, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, I am talking about Javed but in every corner of India, the lamps of such inspiration are burning.
Giving new light to live, showing ways.
On December 3, everyone like this is an opportunity to get inspiration from them.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we have dependents on governments.
Be a middle class person, be a person of lower middle class, be poor, dalit, victims, exploited, disadvantaged, for them, there is constant relation with government arrangements with the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes a bad experience comes from some government Babu in life.
And that very bad experience changes our views to see us in government order throughout the lifetime.
There is also a truth in it, but sometimes millions of people sitting in this government do such excellent work with service and dedication, which never come to us.
Sometimes we do not even know, because it is so easy that we do not know that any government system, any government problem is doing this work.
In our country, ASA Workers, which is Network all over the country.
We have never heard of discussions about ASA Orkers among the people of India or have you heard.
But when I have become an example of his success in the world as the world famous family interpreter of the Billgates Foundation.
Such billgates and milindagets had given them joint Padma Vibhushan last time.
They do very social work in India.
Whatever he has earned for his retirement time and life is being spent in working for the poor.
Whenever they come, they meet and those who have got the opportunity to work with ASA workers, they praise so much, and they have so much to say that what is the dedication to the hope-worker. Do how hard.
How much enthusiasm is to learn new things, they tell all these things.
In the past, the Orissa Government has given special honor to an ASA Orker on Independence Day.
Tendagaon, a small village of Balasore district of Orissa, is a hopeful worker and all the population there is Shidule-Trib.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And a hope-writer of this village, Jamuna Mani Singh, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this tandgaon.
If he goes home and gets the news of a little fever.
On the basis of the primary arrangements taught to him, it should be taken for treatment.
Emphasis on the use of pesticide mosquitoes every home.
As soon as your own child sleeps properly and as much as the care should be done, ASA Worker Jamuna Mani Singh works with full dedication to avoid the entire village mosquitoes.
And he fought with Malaria, prepared to compete with the whole village.
So how many people will be Mani.
How many million people will be around us.
We'll look at them a little respectfully.
Such people become the biggest strength of our country.
How big companions of happiness and misery of society become.
I glorify all such ASA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to see it.
See not only this, but also look at others, read it and maybe you want to add such things.
positive power is the biggest energy.
Discuss the books and if a enthusiastic youth go to the eighth, nineth, tenth class children of neighborhood schools about these-books, tell them that this happened here.
So you can become a social teacher in the true sense.
I invite you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
Climate Change, Global Warming, Dagger-Dagger is also concerned and it is getting approval as a standard before doing every work.
Earth's temperature should not increase now.
It is also concerned about everyone's responsibility.
I once said that the night of Purnima should be closed and bathed in the light of the full moon for hours.
You should experience the light of that moon.
Any friend sent me a link to see and I got an opportunity to see him, so it was convinced that I would tell you this too.
By doing nowhere in Kanpur, a woman does not seem to be on TV, someone would have got the privilege to read more.
But one is doing something that may not have thought of anyone.
He is working to give light to the poor using sun power from solar energy.
He is fighting with darkness and is illuminating his name.
He has formed a committee of women and has installed a plant of solar energy-powered lantern and gives lanterns from the rent of 100 rupees a month.
About 3-4 rupees per day is spent but the whole house remains illuminated and this light works throughout the day to recharge this lantern with solar energy in that plot.
Now see what will happen to the world's big people for climate change, but a light is probably inspiring everyone, doing this work.
Anyway, Noorjahan means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I congratulate Jee T because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur in front of the country and the world.
A lot of congratulations.
Thank you Abhishek ji.
The message you sent me from Gorakhpur.
Prime Minister MRA plan and the ununununged
Those who do not get the money get the money.
By the way, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning is good, in such a short time, about 66 lakh people got 42 thousand crore rupees from the Prime Minister MRA scheme.
Dhobi, naked, selling the newspaper, selling milk.
People doing small business and I am happy that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of these helping S, ST, B are people of this class who work hard and try to run the family with respect on their feet.
Abhishek himself has told his enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news coming.
Someone told me that there is no Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
He got a charge of Rs 8 lakh from the bank under the MRA scheme.
And they started sevage dress, cleaning busines.
I had said in relation to my cleanliness campaign that cleanliness campaign is such that it will prepare new interpreters.
And Shailesh Bhosale showed it.
They have brought a tanker that work and I was told that in such a short time 2 lakh rupees, they also returned the bank.
Eventually this is the intention under our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Bhopal's Mamta Sharma that she got 40 thousand rupees from the bank from the Prime Minister MRA Scheme.
He is working to make a bubble.
And makes a bubble but first he used to bring money from more interest and used to run business hard.
Now due to the good amount of money coming together, he made his work more good.
And due to extra interests and reasons for which he used to spend more money, these days, due to his coming in hand, almost a thousand rupees started to be saved every month.
And his family started growing gradually a good business.
But I would like the plan to be more propagated.
All our banks are more sensitive and help more smaller people.
In fact, these people run the country's economy.
Small working people are the economic power of the country's meaning.
We want to emphasize it.
Good, but to do better.
On the birth anniversary of my dear countrymen, on October 31, Sardar Patel, I had discussed an India-Shreshth India.
These things are that should be constantly aware of social life.
The unity of the nation's jealousy I international vigilance is the first of Liberty country should continue this rites.
An India-specific India I want to give it the form of a plan.
My Gov asked for suggestions on him.
How's the structurer of Programme
What's the people
How did public participation increase
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told that many suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
Some big efforts have also been announced.
You also put your creative mind.
How can this mantra of unity integrity make an India-specific India connect this mantra to one Hindustani
How to plan, how to program.
Be lifeless, be very glorious, be lifelong and be simple to connect everyone.
What should the government do
What to do Civil Society
There may be many things.
It's fun to wear clothes, but I'll be urging you to exercise.
I will be urging you to exercise and yoga for some time to keep the body balanced.
And create an environment in the family, there is only one festival of the family, one hour is to do this together.
So if there is a good weather, then it will be a good habit.
Once again, I have got the good fortune of joining everyone with the mind.
Today, the fifth day match between India and South Africa is going to play in Mumbai.
This series is named Gandhi Mandela series.
And so the importance of the last match has increased more.
Best wishes to all my players.
Today I want to congratulate the friends of Kannur Center of Akashwani.
Congratulations have to be given so that when I started talking about the mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with reverence.
I have to talk about Kerala once again today.
Students of Saint Mary Pper-Primary School of Chittoor in Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
One, these girls have made a picture of India and mother with their thumb marks, on a very large cloth.
That picture of India and mother, India's map has sent me.
Earlier I was surprised why he made India's map with his thumb mark.
But when I read his letter, I came to understand how good a symbolic message he has given.
These are the girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
He is also trying to make people aware in his area and his mission is Angadan.
They are running public awareness campaign for rgan donation.
He has also done dance platforms by going to many places so that people understand the understanding of donation.
Angadan became a tendency and tendency.
These girls have written to me in the letter, that you appeal to people about the organ donation in your mind.
They say that Angad should make a festival.
These days I have enough messages on the phone call.
Devesh of Delhi has given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyesight is needed.
On the death of the road accident, the body's organ can be donated.
Some legal entanglements are also very much.
States have also tried to guide in this direction.
Some states have made a great effort to accelerate it by reducing the paperwork.
Today I can say that in the field of Organ donation, Tamil Nadu is in the advance line.
Many social institutions, many NGTs are doing a very good job in this direction.
To promote the Organ transplant, the National Wargen and Tissue Transplant Organization (NET) has been established.
A 247 fline 1800114770 This service is also available.
And here it has been said that the best description of the joy of renouncing Ten Takteen Bhunjitha is in this mantra.
In the past, we all had seen on TV that a poor contractor, hawker, his wife's liver transplant was done at GB Pant Hospital in Delhi.
And this iver was brought from Lucknow to Delhi with special justice.
And he was the operation successful.
A life has survived.
Angadan Mahadan
Your title Bhunjitha, we do this feeling and we must emphasize this thing.
Dear countrymen, now we celebrate the festival of Navaratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days, Diwali festivals will also be celebrated.
Eid also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi.
For the first time on India's so large scale is being organized.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
A major confluence of African countries is happening outside Africa.
India and Africa are deep.
The population of India is the same population of African countries.
And if we join both, then we are one-third of the world's population.
And says millions of years ago, it was the only territory.
Later these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of harmony between us.
And about 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural relations, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very important role in training the younger generation of most African countries.
Women Resource Development, Apacity Building has studied more than 25 thousand African students in India.
And today many countries of Africa are leaders, have studied in India.
So how deep we have.
And from that point of view this Sumit is very important.
Generally, when the summit is held, then the heads of different countries are found.
Similarly, the meeting of the chiefs is going to be held in a Sumit.
See this is our endeavor that this public should also be meeting.
And this time, the Indian government, especially the KR Minister, performed a very good program.
As many as the CBSE has a pilot school, a village complex program was organized between their children, a program to write poems was organized, their participation was organized.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were schools outside India and India too.
And thousands of schoolchildren wrote things that emphasize the Indo-Africa relations.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace from Porbandar to Memories of Mahatma is a exhibition, mobile exhibition is traveling from Porbandar to Northern states on October 29.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, the villagers and the villagers saw it.
There were very fine compositions in the competition that took place.
I care about a composition, I love it, so I want to hear you.
But it clearly shows us how the opportunity to connect the people.
I enjoy dignity, all the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and OR Ministry.
On August 15, I had put a proposal regarding the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana last time.
After that, many MPs friends realized this work.
Staying with great minds.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
In which where these ideal villages are happening, the head of the country, collector of the collector, some MPs from there, India-government, state-government, all together discussed the ideal village plan.
Under the influence of these leftist militants, many areas have been wasted there.
But our MPs there are very senior, sometimes deputy-speakers are also in Parliament, they have spent their lives for Sriman Karia Munda ji, tribals.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti Jila of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate the respectable MP Shriman Kariya Munda ji.
That's how I got a news from Andhra.
In the scheme of Andhra Pradesh MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji Adarsh village, he himself was consumed and he chose the village panchayat for the ideal village by Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the system is happening, but, they did a big special innovative work.
Shriman Ruwala ji started Kurtai Kut Sugarcane festival on March 11 in the village.
People of all the regions united in it.
How can the village be made the center of economic activity, how can the production of the village be marketed
His attempt to make an autonomous village along with the ideal village is really an officer of Sriman Ruwala ji's enjoyment.
How can my beloved brothers and sisters, talk of mind and do not talk about cleanliness
Savita Rai has sent me messages through a telephone from Mumbai, every year we clean our homes to prepare Diwali.
We make this Diwali clean with our homes as well as our outer environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I want to remind you of my beloved countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media, especially in our country, launched a big campaign and after Diwali, wherever they were cracked, they saw all things and they said that it is not right.
So your point is true that we should do as much as we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And I want to enjoy all the media world of India especially today.
Give India అవార్డుs and I was also watching how many kinds of activity is going on.
How many people are working for it as a One Like One Mission.
How are the places in our country which have been kept so clean
All these things were exposed and I congratulated the commendable work of the India TV Group at that time.
By the way, since the mission of cleanliness campaign has run, I have seen that T enadoo from Andhra, Telangana and especially Sriman Ramuji Rao is very old, but the enthusiasm that is theirs is not less than any young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children of nearly 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra and Telangana.
Be public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks, run a big campaign of cleanliness in many places.
Now these news shows the power to realize the dream of clean India in itself.
ABP News has started this program in the name of India and worked to train the people of the country by highlight.
Our country has hundreds of channels, thousands of newspapers, everybody, I can't take the name of everyone, because of lack of time, but this campaign has run.
And therefore, Savita Rai ji has suggested that the whole country is accepting this work and is moving forward.
From Meghalaya, our governor, Shriman Shanmuganathan, he has written a letter to me and wrote a letter to me about the Mavalyannong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last several years, this village has been raising a bed of cleanliness. And almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And they say that a few years ago, they got the award as Asia's Leanest Willage.
That's it, we all believe that our country will be clean.
With the efforts of the countrymen and in 2019 when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will be able to say 100 million people from the pride by breastfeeding, see, we freed our Bharat Mata from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on August 15 that there are some things where corruption has been done home.
When the poor person goes for a small job, do not know for anyone's intercession, do they have to suffer and how the brokers' group grab their rupees.
I have never heard that there is no psychological in the world that fully checks any person in one minute, two minutes interview.
And with this idea I announced why we're the little priest's jobs, over there, end the tradition of Interview.
My dear young friends, I want to say today that the government has completed all the procedures and the central government's Group D, Group C and Group B will no longer interview for recruitment, I will not be interviewed.
This will be applicable on January 1, 2016
We will not do any hindrance in the process where the process is going on, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
So all young friends have my best wishes
In the same way, in the last hour, we had declared an important plan.
In our country, gold has become part of social life in a way.
Gold is considered to be the medium of economic security.
The crisis is considered to be the key gold of time.
Gold can become the country's economic property and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today I am happy that whatever we promised in the budget, in this Diwali festival and when Dhanteras and people buy gold especially on that day, we are going to launch important plans before that.
Good monatisation scheme we have brought.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as if you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier we used to keep the gold locker and we had to pay the locker rent.
Now the gold will be kept in the bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Say that the countrymen can no longer become gold property
Can't it be converted from gold Dead-Money into a living force
That's what we have to do.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
Another thing is that in the Sovereign gold bonds, you do not have a golden ring in your hand.
So you'll get two and a half thousand rupees instead of that paper.
So we're starting it.
Where to keep gold, his concern will go away, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will keep this scheme with security guarantee in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold ueen.
Ashok Chakra's Gold Coin took about 70 years of independence, but so far we have been using Origin Gold Coin or Gold Bullion Bars has also been using foreigners.
Along with this, the Gold Techion of twenty grams will also be available for the people.
I believe that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen are the birth anniversary of Iron and Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on October 31.
An India best India.
After remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of the entire India comes out.
This great man has made a big contribution to India's unity.
Iron-male has introduced its potential.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but he had the dream of uniting India.
Geographically he showed tax, but the mantra of unity should be the medium of our contemplation, behavior, expression, media.
Many creeds, many sects, many bids, many castes, many environments, how many varieties are filled with their country and this diversity, due to which our glimpse is.
If this was not diversity, then perhaps we can not do the glory we proud of.
And therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Shanti, goodwill, unity are the roots of development.
For the last several years, on October 31, there are programs of Run for Nitty in many corners of the country.
I have heard this time also its plans are being made around, people are preparing for the race of unity with enthusiasm.
The race of unity is the race for development in true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development is also a race for unity.
Come, pay homage to Sardar Sahib.
Extend the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, now all of you will be engaged in preparations for Diwali, cleanliness will be done in the house.
New things will be bought.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated differently in every corner of our country.
I wish you a lot of good wishes for the holy festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come in mind.
I have to go to Britain on the second day of my dear countrymen, Deepawali.
I am very thrilled for my visit to Britain this time.
The Indian government and state governments also give skirmishes to such classes of society, tribals, backward, such promising children who go abroad.
I believe that when such children of India go to study in Britain, this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage area for them, inspiration will become a land and learn something in life but later to live for the country, this message was given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that in my visit to Britain, I am specially thrilled, for many years the subject was entangled and now that building is the property of 100 million people, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's name is connected, you can guess how much people like me will be.
I am going to get another opportunity in London, unveil the statue of Lord Vishwaswar.
Many years ago, Lord Vishwaswar worked for democracy, Employment of Women, it is a really studying aspect of the world.
The inauguration of Lord Vishwaswar's statue on the land of London is an excellent example of how long the great men of India used to think in themselves centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are connected , we get all the countrymen ' s mind thrilled .
You are associated with the talk of my beloved countrymen.
Through telephone, your suggestions keep getting me through MyGov.in.
Akashwani is also discussed in the matter of your letters.
The government officials are called and discussed.
Some people write their problems, efforts are also made to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
Some languages have got the good fortune to learn but still there are so many languages that where did I learn
But still I am grateful to Akashwani that he broadcasts the matter of this mind at 8 pm in the regional language of every state.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the thing is of my mind.
Last time I was completing one year today we are entering the new year.
My beloved countrymen once again best wishes.
Jai Hind
Talk of mind, September 2015
My dear countrymen, you all bow down
I do not consider it bad. I am seeing better than this that the Parliament of India is also discussing for cleanliness of India. On the other hand, on the one hand, Parliament and on the other side, the infants of this country - talk about cleanliness, what can be the good fortune of the bigger country. This movement is going on, the ideas of hatred towards hygiene, the environment of hygiene is coming. These governments will also be forced to work,
Even the institutions of local Swaraj - whether it is Panchayat, municipality, municipality or state or central - everyone has to work on it. Everyone has to move forward, we have to move forward, despite the shortcomings, and this India will celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's 150th Jayanti in 2019, when we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's dreams, we work towards fulfilling the dreams, and you know what Mahatma Gandhi said
This child should ask the mind. Likewise, I met Sonam Patel, a very small girl, 9, she is a daughter of Sadavrit Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi, is a daughter of a very poor family. And I was surprised that the girl, the whole Gita is confined to her. But the biggest thing was that when I asked her, she also told Shalok, she used to define her in English, define her in Hindi. I asked her father, she said, she is speaking from the age of five, I said
Speak, we do not even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, only the Gita reads and dos anything
Once again, to talk about the mind, I got an opportunity to come in between you.
People in the far south are colored in the festival of Onam and tomorrow the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Government of India has implemented many new schemes for social security, for ordinary humans
I'm glad that in a very short time, in a wide range, everyone has accepted these plans.
I had made a small passion that on the festival of Raksha Bandhan, we give this security plan to our sisters.
I have got fat information that eleven crore families are associated with this scheme since the start of the scheme.
And I was told that, almost half of the benefits, parents and sisters have been found.
I think it's a good sign.
I also give many good wishes to all the mothers and sisters of Raksha Bandhan's holy festival.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan-Dhan Yojana was taken on a large scale a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
The account was to be opened from zero balance, but the poor saved, saved the amount of twenty thousand crores.
The main stream of the economy is also the banking sector and this system has reached the poor house, so it has also emphasized the plan of bank-mitra.
Today more than 1.2 million banks and friends are working across the country.
Young people also got employment.
Only the accounts are not to be stuck and now thousands of people have become entitled to take overdraft under this public fund scheme and they also took it.
And the poor can get money from the bank, this belief is also born.
I once again congratulate all the concerned and request all the poor brothers and sisters who open the bank account, that you do not give up the relationship with the bank.
These banks are yours, you should not leave it now.
I'm bringing you, it's your job to catch him now.
All of us must be active
But in a very short time, Gujarat's enlightened, all my citizen brothers and sisters took care of the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again went to Gujarat on the path of peace.
This is the right path of peace, unity, brotherhood and we have to walk by joining the shoulder on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I got an opportunity to meet the scholars of Sufi tradition.
They got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell the truth that the way I got the opportunity to listen to them, something like music is playing in a way.
Their words are selected, their way of conversation, that is, the generosity which is in Sufi tradition, which is a generosity, in which there is a mix of music, all of them have been felt between these scholars.
I liked it very much.
Perhaps it has become the most important thing to bring the world to the right nature of Islam.
I believe that Sufi tradition is associated with love, liberality, they will reach this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity, I will also benefit Islam
And I also tell others why we don't believe any sect, but sometimes you should understand the Sufi tradition.
In the coming days, I'm going to get another chance, and I consider this invitation my luck.
In India, scholars from Buddhist traditions of many countries of the world are coming to Bodh Gaya, and are going to discuss the global topics related to humanity, I have also got an invitation in it, and it is a matter of happiness for me that those people have invited me to come to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru was Bodh Gaya.
I am going to get an opportunity to be intelligent with these scholars around the world, I have a very happy moment for me.
My beloved farmer, brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you about the mind, especially today.
I have already mentioned this subject in the matter of mind.
You must have heard, I have heard in Parliament, I have heard in public meetings, I have heard in the mind.
I have come to say every time that the government's mind is open about the controversy over the Accusation Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion of farmers' interest, I have been saying it repeatedly.
This means that the situation that was before my government was formed, it has now been reproduced.
But one work was incomplete in it, and it was 13 such points, which had to be completed in one year and so we brought it in the rdinace, but the matter was also confused with these disputes.
Ordinance is ending, but from which farmers are going to get direct benefits, the direct economic benefit of the farmers is connected, we are implementing 13 points, bringing them under the rules, so that the farmers are not harmed, economic losses, and therefore the 13 points which were left in the earlier law, I am convincing my farmer brothers and sisters, that this is not the slogan for us, it is our mantra - the village, the poor farmer's welfare - and then on August 15, we said that not only the Agriculture Department, but the farmers' welfare department, which will be decided very fast.
I have to say another thing that two days ago the war of 1965 took fifty years and whenever it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan Mantra.
And it is very natural to remember all those martyrs who keep India's tricolor flag, its reservoirs.
I salute all the related to the victory of the 65 war.
I bow down to the heroes.
And incidents of such history keep getting constant inspiration from us.
The way I got the opportunity to meet the people of Sufi tradition last week, there was a great pleasant experience in the same way.
I got an opportunity to talk to the dignitaries of the country for hours.
They got an opportunity to listen, and I was happy that in the field of science, India is doing a very fine job in many directions.
Our scientists are actually doing excellent work.
Now there is an opportunity to reach these amendments to the public.
How to convert the principles into equipment
How do you add Lab to Fand
It has to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I could say that he was also an very inspiring for me, also ducative.
And I saw, many young scientists were talking to Umang, how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said in the mind last time that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I think there are many opportunities, there are many possibilities.
I keep coming many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah has written to me about ductional Reforms on My Gov.in.
Emphasis has emphasized on improvement in education sector.
I have to say a thing to my young friends that I had told the Red Fort on August 15, why these interviews for low-level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also the reason for corruption at the bottom level.
And I said on August 15 that I want to be free from the interview tradition at one level.
I am happy that in such a short time, it has been 15 days, but the government is moving forward very fast.
Information is being sent, and nearly now the decision will be implemented that small jobs will be discharged from the interview.
The poor will not have to run for intercession.
There will be no exploitation, corruption.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come in India.
For health, especially the maternal mortality and infant mortality rates, all to the action plan, 24 countries of the world together contemplated in India's land.
This was the first time outside the US, this program happened in any other country.
And it is true that even today, in our country, about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die every year, at the time of delivery and immediately after that.
It is worrying and scary.
Well, improvement is enough.
India has started to appreciate internationally, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of Titness in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, our newborn children.
Brother-in-law, news of dengue is coming nowadays.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am not talking about clean India is directly connected to it.
We see advertisemant on T, but we don't notice.
Advertisement prints in the newspaper, but our attention is not taken.
There are ways to maintain cleaning with pure water in small things in the house.
There is a comprehensive public education in these things, but we do not care and sometimes it seems that we live in a very good house, are very good arrangements and it is not known that our own water is flooded and somewhere we invite dengue.
I will urge you all that death should not be so cheap.
Life is very worthy.
Water madness, indifference to cleanliness, it becomes the reason for death, it is not right
Free check facilities are available for dengue at around 514 centers across the country.
From time to time, it is useful for life to investigate and in this you all need cooperation together.
And cleanliness should be given great importance.
These days, festivals are held in our country in a way from defence to Diwali.
Why not connect our festival with cleanliness now
You see rituals will become a nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to hear a good news, I always tell you that now we will not get the good fortune to die for the country, but for the country it has got the good fortune to live.
Both of these brothers have raised the glory of India.
In the US, Race Facros America is a cycle-Race, it is very difficult, about four thousand eight hundred kilometers long race.
This year these two brothers won this race.
Look how everyone is trying to move forward to the country.
And this is the case, when such incidents listen, the chest gets strained.
Sometimes due to persecution, we make a lot of injustice to our youth.
And the old generation always thinks, the new generation does not understand anything and I think this process has come for centuries.
Experience in relation to my youth is different.
Sometimes, talking to the youth, we also get to learn a lot.
I have met many youths who say that Bhai, I have taken fast in life, Sundai on Yicle.
Some people say that I have kept Yicle-Ay one day a week.
My health is also good.
And I also have great joy of being my young.
Nowadays, in our country, the bicycle runs in many cities and people who promote the bicycle are also very much.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today when two young people of my country hoisted the flag in the US, I like to mention the direction in which the youth of India think.
I want to congratulate the Maharashtra government in particular today.
I enjoy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - The land of Indu Mill of Mumbai - had been hanging for a long time to make his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra completed this work and now Baba Saheb Ambedkar's grand-divine motivation monument will be there, which will inspire us to work for the Dalit, the victims, the exploited, the deprived.
But at the same time, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has now been bought.
When Indians traveling around the world go to London, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the monument which is now going to form the Maharashtra government there, will become our inspirational place.
I give sadhuism to these two efforts to honor Baba Saheb Ambedkar to the Maharashtra government, I proudly enjoy them.
My dear brothers and sisters, before coming to the next mind, tell me your idea, because I believe democracy runs with public participation.
The country can move forward only by joining the shoulder.
My best wishes to you.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers, sisters will definitely get help in sowing Kharif.
And I've come to mind a pleasure and I'm very happy.
In our country, pulses of pulses and oilseeds - is very low.
The poor should have pulses, even a little oil in vegetables, etc. to eat.
My farmer congratulates my brothers and sisters, so I enjoy them a lot.
My dear countrymen, 26th July, in the history of our country, Kargil is marked as Vijay Day.
The country's farmer's relationship is as much as the country's youth is from the ground.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was heavier on hundreds of enemies.
Without care of my life, I bow down to those heroic soldiers who foiled the enemies' efforts.
Kargil war was not fought only on the borders, every city of India, every village, contributed to this war.
This war fought for those mothers, those sisters whose young men were fighting enemies in son or brother, Kargil.
The daughters fought, whose hands did not come down, Pehar's henna.
And therefore, today, on Kargil Vijay Day, all these soldiers are my centuries.
On July 26, I consider even more important, because after becoming our government in 2014, we started My Gov on July 26 in a few months.
Our resolve to increase public participation in democracy, adding people to the work of development, and I am happy to say this after one year, nearly two crore people saw My Gov.
About five and a half lakh people made comments, and the most happy thing is that more than fifty thousand people suggested on PM applications, they took time, made a pind apply, considered this work as important.
Now it is small, but no one has ever noticed this in the government, nor has it been thought.
But the government seriously considered the suggestion of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, and today this arrangement was implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today people who are formed, tag-line are formed, the program is created, policy is formed, there are very positive suggestions on MyGov.
There is a new rash hair experience in the governance system.
There is a new consciousness experience.
These days, I have started suggesting on my gov, what should I say on August 15
Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai, he has sent many suggestions.
Speaking on daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this gave me a idea, what should I say on August 15 this time, can you send me a suggestion
Can be sent to MyGov, you can write a letter on Akashwani, you can write a letter in the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe, perhaps this is a good idea that my speech on August 15 should be suggested from public Janardhana.
I believe you must send good suggestions.
I want to express my concerns to one thing.
I do not want to give any preachings nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibility of the units of state government, central government or local Swaraj institutions.
Two days ago, I was seen on the scene of an accident in Delhi, and after the accident, the scooter driver was teasing for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people constantly write to me that you speak something on the road safety.
Warn the people. Bangalore's Hoshakot are axis, Amey Joshi of Pune, pleasures of Murbidari of Karnataka are auspicious.
And when they look at the data, the heart moves.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to accident, due to Rud accident, one dies every 4 minutes.
And the topic of the biggest concern is that often one-third of the dead, there are youths of 15 to 25 years of age and one death shakes the whole family.
The work that the government should do, but I pass through my parents, whether you run two-wheelers or you run our-wheeler - the environment of paying attention to the things that are on the society should also be increased in the family.
Another project is for us, it is going to be expanded, and it is going to be expanded, Jashales Treatment. Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara. From there to Mumbai, Rachi, Rangao, Moundia highways, we have a shields treatment. And it means that the first fifty hours - money is not, who will not give money, who will leave all these concerns - once the injured in Rod accident, how to get the best service, how are we giving priority to it,
To provide information about the accidents across the country, toll-free 1033 numbers, ambulance system, all these things. But all these things are done after accident.
If you don't have an accident, then we all really have to see each life very dear, one life is very dear, in that form it needs to be seen.
Sometimes I say, become employees working.
In the past, some incidents came in my mind, I realized that I should talk to you, sometimes people are tired of doing jobs, and some years of talk is fine, salary gets done, work will be done, this is the feeling.
I am glad to see these examples how life can be brought in my work too.
Vijay Biswal has said that how your interest, your art, your capacity can be connected with your work.
Maybe now Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
Moreover, one thing came in my mind - the whole team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, the whole group started a work that touched my mind and I liked this work.
They started Operation Malayalam - Now someone, listening to it will seem to be something else.
Look how Raksha Bandhan's meaning changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Now a news came to my ear, sometimes these little things enjoy my mind so I'm sharing you.
There is a small village by Keshla in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have tried to make a toilet for the last few months.
And now no person in that village has to go openly.
They did this, but, when the whole work was completed, the whole village celebrated such a festival as a big festival is celebrated.
These excellent examples are coming to me how the society is changing the price in life, how the people are changing and how the citizen of the country is taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, about the questions of North-East.
Well, the people of North-East are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's good.
But I'm glad to tell them today that there is a separate ministry for the North East.
Will go to the districts, go to the villages, meet the local government officials there, talk to the people, talk to the citizens.
Hear the problems, will also do what the Indian government has to do to solve the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come to go, they also feel how beautiful the state, how good people, now have to be developed by developing this area, they have to be solved by their problems.
If they return with this resolve, even after coming to Delhi, they have become very simple to understand the problems there.
So a good effort, trying to go away from Delhi to the east, which I'm not saying attachment police, that's the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all proud of the fact that we enjoy the success of Mars Mission.
But sometimes it also comes to the idea, if we talk to the young generation today and ask them what you want to be ahead, then one or half of the 100 hardly get a suitent that will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern to reduce the trend towards science.
Take interest in innovation, get encouragement, go to their capabilities, a very important requirement.
I also keep telling the government's IAS officers that if you have gone forward by writing so much, then you should also go to a school-college near you for two to four hours a week and talk to the children.
Your experience, the power that you have will certainly work for this new generation.
Work is difficult, but it is to do.
We have started it, and in the coming years, we get 24 hours electricity to the villages.
Even the children of the village, if they have to read in the examination days, then there is no problem of electricity.
If there are small industries in the village too, then electricity is available.
Today, even if you have to chart mobile, then you have to go to another village.
The benefits that the cities get should be met by the villages.
And so we have started Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti program.
I know so big country, millions of villages, to reach far and wide, to reach home.
But, it's only for the poor to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, it has decided to talk of variety of things.
In a way, our country has the opportunity of August month, September month, festivals.
There are many festivals.
My best wishes to everyone.
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your ideas will be very useful to me.
In the last mind , I had prayed to you that if you go somewhere in holidays , and there ' s a memorable picture there , I ncredible I
When I told you, I didn't think it would have a strong consequence.
Millions of people posted photos, in Twitter, Facebook, in Instagram.
I can say, one to another to see a scene, India is full of diversity.
Status, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the Indian government has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big job, which you people have done.
And something even showed me so much that I also re-tweeted him.
We will move this forward, continue, the world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister, but the person inside me sometimes loses away from all posts and posts.
On June 21, International Yoga Day, I can say that my mind was agitated in the same way, when I kept this subject in NH.
We can claim that the sun never collapses in the world of yoga teachers.
The way the world honored Yoga by laying the eyelids and feet, the way the whole world raised on its shoulders, who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud.
The mind got confused.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sean River and Fiel Tower are very proud symbols, they preferred that place to do yoga, gave the same place.
People in New York made yoga on Times Suare.
If you talk of Australia, Sydney, then the picture of Pera House comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time by keeping yoga equal to Pera House.
Whether it is North America, Silicon Valley, Milan's uomo athedral, it's a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, the NPS-Keeping Force also performed a lot of yoga.
Even in India, on Siachen, our soldiers were doing yoga on the white snow sheet, then Yoga programs were organized by the Navy in the sea, wherever our naval ships were all around.
Delhi has registered its place in Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogapath.
I am grateful to the heart of the country and the world, and I can say that this was not a program of programme.
It seemed that from every corner of the world a new curiosity, a new joy, a new glimpse, a new association.
A few days ago when I tweeted a photograph by a family from Twitter, Vietnam, doing a small child, so lovely that photo, he became so popular all over the world.
Everyone, men and women, old-boys, villages-shahr, devoted converties or devolutional councils, everyone got involved.
Yoga became a reason for connecting the world in the true sense.
But one thing I feel, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity has increased towards India.
Here's the voluses, the traditions here, the heritage here, the world wants to know.
We all have the obligation that the world should distribute us, the world should familiar with our legacy without lagpet.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that what is new in our things, it seems. Like our family voluses, we do not know India's family voluses are very big for the world.
I'm sure I'm gonna be strange.
There are many things that our ancestors have given us and the best they have the right to the world.
The success of International Yoga Day has come with a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
This becomes our responsibility that we give the best yoga teacher to the world.
It becomes our responsibility to see all the traditions of yoga from the world on a platform.
Introduction of institutions related to yoga, information about yoga gurus, information about yoga.
If you want to learn yoga, you can learn, where will you get yoga teacher, you should prepare a database and I believe you can do it.
Let's start somewhere, it will also become a new power.
I've seen the events of the past few days more, the working government, the running government... how can the results come out once the goal is fixed, we have seen it in the past.
And when there was disappointment around, we do not forget this, one year ago the same voice was heard from all four sides, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government, no one is paid attention to it.
If there is a small news somewhere in the two-and-a-half years, then come here so much. In one corner, small department, but he leaked Yoga Day.
And small departments in the world organized such a big job.
If the goal is in front then the small unit also does the best work, it is a sample.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the people from the Yemen.
Within hours, how did the people of India run to help Nepal, when the working government had to open public accounts in the bank, the people of all the banks came to the fray and in a short time millions of people connected with the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed for toilets in schools from the Red Fort. And I had said that till August 15, we have to complete this work.
The work that could not be done in 60 years was very courageous to call in one year, about four and a half lakh toilets were to be made, but today I can say with satisfaction, it is still delayed to come on August 15, but it was not completed, but people completed the work of making toilets in nearly schools.
I mean, the government, the people, the government, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, we had launched three public security schemes, I did from Calcutta.
There has been very positive results in such a short time.
There has been very little work in India from the point of view of public security, but due to these three schemes, we are putting a huge jump.
In such a short time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these public security but we have to move forward.
In August, the Raksha Bandhan festival comes.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a very big gift.
Let us all try to fulfill this resolve together with me.
When I talk about the mind, many people also send me suggestions.
This time, many people have sent suggestions that I should say something for the monsoon.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji of Mysore, Pravin Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that you must tell some things about the mind for the monsoon.
They have sent good suggestions.
You may also have to enjoy hot packs, sweets, corn, along with tea in the rain.
But at the same time, the way the sun rays give life, the rain gives us life.
The village's water should be in the village, the city's water should be in the city, it should be our resolve, efforts should be made to stop the water.
And rain water stops and if it returns to the earth and recharges on the earth, then problems of the year are solved.
I always tell people that if Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace, if you go to Porbandar in Gujarat and if you go to see Mahatma Gandhi's house, then there is a tank in the geography within his house, two hundred years old, in which rain water is directly there There was a system of going there.
Porbandar is on the coast, but sweet water was kept in the house by collecting rain water, even at that time such care was done.
We can also do it.
We all should be in large quantities by the youth through the social organizations, the campaign for plantation, tree plantation in this rainy season.
And I suggest a suggestion and I have direct experience, it's a very successful experience.
This is my entire rural technology.
When you plant the plant, put an old soil clock in the bugle of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill water once a month, then it will also run.
I also keep telling the farmers, instead of planting a fence on the edge of your farm.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the rainy days the diseases spread a lot.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria start growing and cleaning becomes very important for this, sweetness becomes very important.
The request to drink pure water is necessary.
It is true that the disease will be far from us as far as we care.
Water should also be, rain should also be, but prevention of disease.
Countrymen, now we have launched three new schemes, especially for urban people.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the Amrit (AMRT) scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities life worth living.
In the same way, there should be such a country to equalize the world.
In the country, there should be such a smart city to equalize the world and on the other hand, a poor person from the country should also have his home to live. And the house in which there is electricity, water, toilets, nearby school is arranged.
In 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, we want to give home to the countrymen.
With these three things, a big plan has started.
I believe all these plans will work to bring about changes in urban life.
I myself are all connected to you by social media, many new ideas keep meeting me with people, good information is also available in relation to the government.
But sometimes a person sitting in a remote village, even touches our hearts.
You know, save a daughter from the government-biography program is going on.
But when the government's program makes a person, society, village, then how much its strength increases.
In the past, Sriman Sunil Jagalan ji, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village of Haryana, took him a very funny initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to the children.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
Most in Haryana.
But the Sarpanch daughter Bachao campaign of a small village of Haryana will turn this kind of turn, then the mind is very happy, and a new hope is going on.
So I express my happiness.
But I have also got inspiration from this incident and therefore I also urge you to post with your daughter, Seli with Daughter, with your daughter and post the cellie with Daughter.
Bachao daughter with her - Teach this idea by writing a tagline, writing the best line, it can be in any language. English, Hindi, your mother tongue, any language.
The very inspiring tagline I'll have, Selfie of your daughter and I'll retweet you.
We can all change this thing into public movement in a way, save daughter-daughter.
The work that Bhai Sunil started from village Bibipur in Haryana and we all move forward and I urge you to post the celliwithdogter.
So in this rain you all enjoy a lot of good wishes, rain.
Make our country green.
International Yoga Day is not for one day, you continue the practice of yoga.
You see, you'll see the advantage.
Make it a part of your life, surely.
Uncredible I India, you travel somewhere, keep sending the photo.
The country and the world will know how many diversity our country has.
One thought it was very low in regard to handicraft.
We have to reach the world, to reach India's features all around.
And we have a simple medium, we must reach.
My dear countrymen, just today, I will get the next time to talk about the next mind.
In the light and light environment, 130 million people used to listen to many things, repeated and sometimes their own things became inspiration for their own people.
You can imagine how it might have gone in the middle.
Perhaps, it wasn't a lifeless program
This program had life, self-sacrifice, mind had an attachment, heart was connected, and due to this, the time spent between me, that time felt very difficult.
I was doing something every moment and when I talk about the mind, I'm speaking, the word is probably mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, the male is yours, the supramental is yours.
feeling an emptyness
But this Sundai waited a lot
Well, finally got a chance
Many messages have come in the last few months in which people said that they are missing the mind .
Sometimes I think it's my journey to synthesis.
This is my vital journey of adultery
My calm dialogue with me was also part of the experience of my spiritual journey in a way .
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath
Most people have taken political meanings from it .
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not tell more things today, but I will do so much that the emptiness that was due to this short break of mind, in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, maybe he had given an opportunity to fill something.
The rest is your curiosity - I think sometimes I ' ll discuss it too .
Like people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your effort to force a positive thing, I feel constant in your point of view
The chits that come to mind, which get input, are completely different from the Routine government functioning.
In a way your letter also becomes the reason for inspiration for me and sometimes becomes the reason for energy .
Sometimes I do some of your words to cover my idea process.
If people keep the challenges facing the country and society, then they also tell solutions along with it.
If one writes for hygiene , he is displeasing for evil , but he appreciates the efforts of hygiene .
If someone discusses the environment then he feels pain, but at the same time he also tells what he has done - he also explains what he has seen and the imaginations that he has in his mind also pains.
It tells us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
Need to enforce those strengths and talents, to provide opportunity, implement them
The point of mind also shows that in the progress of the country, all 130 million people want to join with strength and activism and I will definitely say one thing that in the matter of mind, so many telephone cells come, so many messages come, but the element of complaint is very low, and someone asks for something, so one thing has not come in my mind in the last five years.
When I make these things analysis you can imagine how much joy comes to my heart, how much energy will I get
Actually, I'm not here - You brought me, you've just placed me and you gave me the chance to speak once again
Let ' s go forward with this feeling .
When the emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to political realm only, the politicians were not limited to the jail bars, the movement was not reduced.
In emergency, every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been snatched
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the big election campaign, from rich in our country to poor, everyone was happy to decide the future of our country in this festival.
When something close to us, we make its importance understimate, its Hamaging facts also disappear.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted, Sitty One Reore
This number may seem very common to us , but if according to the world , if we leave one China , then more people in India than any country in the world .
The voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, their number is more than the total population of the United States, about double
The number of total voters in India is more than the population of Europe
It introduces the vastness and broadness of our democracy .
2019 Lok Sabha election was the world's largest democratic election in history so far
You can imagine how large resources and human power must be needed to complete such elections
Millions of teachers, officers and employees were successful in election day and night
In order to successfully compensate this great citizen of democracy, about 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces performed their obligation, only 20 lakh policemen from different states also performed labor
As a result of the hard work of these people this time more voting was done than last time
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVMs (M) machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big
All this was done so that it could be ensured that no voter is deprived of his franchise
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only a woman voter was made police station
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
This polling station is located at a height of 15 , 000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh .
Apart from this, there is another fact that is proud of this election
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted as enthusiasm as men
Polling percentage of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact associated with this is that today the record in Parliament is 78 women MPs
I congratulate the Election Commission, and every person associated with the election process, very much and bow to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth many times, don't book the drop, I requested if we can give books instead of flowers in reception
Then sufficient are the people of the Book .
However, there was not enough time, but during the migration, I got an opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His stories contain the mood of the whole of India .
When I was reading the story of his name of intoxication, my mind went on economic inequalities in the society itself.
This story of amindar's son Goddess and poor family's beer learns that if you are not careful then it does not know when the effect of bad contact goes on.
The second story, who touched my heart, was Idgah, a child's sensitivity, pure love for his grandmother, so mature emotion at such a young age
4-5-year-old Hamid, when he comes to his grandmother with chicken from the fair, really, human sensitivity reaches his peak
The last line of this story is very emotional because there is a very great truth of life in it, the child Hamid played a part of the old Hamid, the elderly Amina, the girl became Amina.
This is the great story of the night of Poose .
The story found a living picture of the irony of a poor farmer ' s life .
Even after its crop is destroyed , the light farmers are happy because now they will not have to sleep in the field in the cold .
Although these stories are almost a century ago, their relevance still feels as much as possible.
After reading them, I felt a different kind of feeling
When talking about reading, in any media, I was reading about Kerala's Akshara Library
You wonder to know that this library is in a village in the midst of dense forests of Idukki.
P.V. Chinnathampi, who runs the primary school teacher PK Murlidharan and small tea shop, both of them have done tireless work for this library.
There was also a time when books were brought here by filling in the knot and loading on the back
Today, this library is showing everyone a new way with tribal children
Gujarat campaign in Gujarat was a successful use
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this campaign to read books
In today's digital world, at the time of Google Guru, I'll urge you to take some time and place the book in your Daily Routine.
You ' ll really enjoy it and write it on the Narendramodi App that all the listeners of the mind will also know about it .
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues that are not only a challenge for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your Comments on Narendramodi App and MyGov and I saw that many people wrote a lot about the problem of water
Pawan Gaurai of Belgavi (Belgavi), Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about the challenges related to water.
Water has a lot of importance in our culture
Give your blessings to the mother , like the mother . Perhaps you will rain upon us .
Many parts of the country are affected every year due to lack of water
You wonder if only 8 of the water received from the rainy season is saved in our country .
I believe, we will also solve this crisis with public participation, public strength, strength, strength, cooperation and resolve of one hundred and thirty million countrymen like other problems.
Considering the importance of water , the new water power ministry has been formed in the country .
This will make decisions on all matters relating to water .
A few days ago , I tried to separate something .
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs across the country to the village head
I wrote to the village heads that to save water, to save water, to save the drop- drop water of rain, they call the meeting of the village council and discuss the village with the villagers.
I am happy that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month , millions of people laboured in thousands of Panchayats .
People in the village-village resolved to accumulate one drop of water
Today, I want to tell you about a sarpanch in the talk of mind.
Listen, the Sarpanch of the Lupung Panchayat of Katkamsandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us all the message my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role for water conservation
From me, all the village heads, all the sarpanchs, best wishes for their activism
There are many Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the initiative of water conservation
In a way , the whole village has become an opportunity .
It seems that the people of the village, now in their village, have gathered in the competition to build water temples.
As I said, collective efforts can gain great positive results
There can be no formula for dealing with water crisis across the country
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in different ways
But everyone's goal is the same, and he's saving water, water conservation
The dryness lines in Punjab are being cured
This effort is getting rid of the problem of waterlogging
The construction of tank in Thimaipalli (Thimaipalli) of Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, there has been a major change from small ponds made in the fields
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20 thousand women came together to revive Nag river
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on the Rainwater Harvesting together.
I believe that many such efforts are being made and when we unite, firmly try, we can also impossible
When the people join, the water will survive
Today , through the point of mind , I am requesting 3 people from the countrymen .
My first request is such that the countrymen should give cleanliness the form of a public movement, in the same way start a public movement for water conservation.
We all together resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is the Prasad given to God, water is the form of Paras.
first used to say that iron becomes gold by touching each other .
I say, water is transparent and from across, water touches, new life is built
Start an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Explain about water related problems, as well as spread the ways of saving water
I urge the celebrities of different regions, especially for water conservation, to lead innovative campings
Be the film world, play world, be our companions of the media, people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations, people who are narratives, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awake society, add society, join society
You see, we'll see changes in front of your eyes
My second request from the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for the protection of water in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share those traditional methods of water conservation
If any of you have got an opportunity to go to the birthplace of Porbandar, Puja Bapu, then there is another house behind the house of Puja Bapu, there is 200 years old water tank and there is still water in it and there is a system to stop rain water, I always used to say that whatever Kirti temple goes, see the water tank of that water.
Let us inspire people to conserve water by making a list of more and more methods connected to water conservation
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShakti Hashtag
My dear countrymen, I also have to thank you for one thing and thank the people of the world.
On June 21, once again with the activation of Yoga Day, with the enthusiasm, three-three-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day
The awareness that has come to the official health here is increasing the significance of Yoga Day .
Everyone, in every corner of the world, if a yoga lover welcomes him when the sun comes out, then the sun is the whole journey of the sun.
In India, from Himalayan to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from A Gyms to the warm desert, from villages to cities, not only yoga was done everywhere, but it was collectively collected.
Presidents of many countries of the world, Prime Ministers, well-known personalities, general citizens showed me on the twitter how they celebrated yoga in their respective countries
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family
We all know that healthy and sensitive persons are needed to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures this .
Therefore, publicity of yoga is a great work of social service
Should not he be honored by recognising such service
In the year 2019, the announcement of Prime Ministers Awards to contribute excellently to Yoga's promotion and devolution was a matter of great satisfaction for me in myself.
This award has been given to organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have made significant contributions in the promotion of yoga
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, who has popularized Yoga throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses there or take the name of Italy's Ms. Antonietta Roi, who started all Yoga International and spread yoga throughout Europe
These are inspiring examples in itself .
If this is a matter related to yoga, can Indians stay behind in it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honored, for the last several decades, Yoga is dedicated
To connect with your ideas is a very important journey for me .
Let us meet, talk
Listen to your feelings, keep conscious, keep understanding
Sometimes try to live those feelings
Be your blessings
You're my inspiration, you're my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy talking about the responsibilities of life
Then , once next month , we ' ll meet again to talk about the mind .
Thank you all for my greatest
This season is also of heat on one side, so there is somewhere fun.
Talk of mind, April 2015
Talk of mind, December 2014
The special one-hour program has been organized and I have seen, it did not only have the program of government's evils, one thought and I believe, a way to get out of the problem, and due to this, the atmosphere of a good discussion has started. The government's responsibility has also been resented. They think they can not be indifferent now. I sometimes, I want to ask those youths drowned in drunkenness. Do you ever think you would have to feel a different life in the lump of two hours, four hours, but you will have to feel the problems, but you will have to feel the problems that you buy money from where
Have you ever thought
Imagine
If the money of these drugs goes to terrorists
If terrorists buy arms from these money
And a terrorist from those weapons will burn the bullets in my country's young man's chest
My country's soldiers will be martyred
Have you ever thought that a mother's red killer, loved the life of the mother of India, living for the country, the soldier's chest has been shot, is it not so
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their innovative progress with our children
What are you tired of Modi ji
One month is very long .
Many incidents happen in the country and the world .
You all celebrated Diwali with joy and enthusiasm .
There are festivals that keep filling the glimpse of life from time to time, poor, rich, rich, rich, rural, city, festival in everyone's life has its own importance.
Sometimes think that leave or. Logs are useless, people do not have to do anything. Our country is like this.
I talk about my mind last and today I say it is very important to change this thinking , our country is not so , the people of our country are not such .
Sometimes I think the country is very far ahead, the governments are far behind.
And when I feel that it is perhaps very important for governments to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I am seeing that these young people are committed to doing something or the other of India, relevant, looking for opportunities.
and is doing it in your own way .
I said last time, buy at least one khadi garment.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become a mineral . But I got information from the Khadi Bhandars that sales of nearly 100 per cent Hundred and Twenty five per cent increased in a week .
In a way , khadi was sold more than double in a week from 2 October to 1 week , compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I pray to the Indians .
Cleanliness . Someone can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of such mass movement .
There are many expectations, and should be.
And a good result is coming to me, cleaning is now being seen in two parts.
One is the old dirt, which is the means of dirt, what will the people sitting in the government do for it
There is a very big challenge but you cannot escape from the responsibility .
All governments have to take steps for this responsibility because the pressure of the public is going to increase.
and the media is also playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect that is very funny, enjoying and satisfying the mind.
We won ' t talk about the new dirt .
I have done a mail to Satna, Madhya Pradesh, some Sriman Bharat Gupta, they sent a mail to my migov.
He said his experience, he was going to visit his railway. He said that he used to go to the railway even earlier, this time also went to the railway, but I am seeing that people in every passenger.Relves keep eating, throwing paper and paper. Nobody threw it, not only did he find that there was a dustbin in the box, put garbage in it.
And when he saw that there was no arrangement in the Bhai railway , he himself collected his waste in the corner .
It was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharatji that he has delivered this information to me .
But I am seeing that the most effect has happened in small children .
Hundreds of families discuss that if our child eats chocolates now , then the paper takes place immediately .
I just saw someone in the social media that someone had written. Today's hero. And in today's hero, he gave a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone seems that our country, we will not be dirty.
We ' ll not make any difference to filth .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassment, then someone gets them to bite.
I consider it a good sign .
One good thing is also happening that those who come to meet me these days, people from all the areas of the society meet.
Some talk about cleanliness, talk about education, talk about social reform.
Someone is discussing that our family life is destructive .
I think , otherwise , if such a businessman comes first , he will talk to the Government about his own selfishness .
But I see a big change .
They talk less about their selfishness, talk more about taking some responsibility related to society.
These things that I see when I add, I notice that we are moving forward towards a very good change.
If my poor family is not sick , there will never be a financial crisis in his life .
He will work hard, earn, family will run.
And therefore direct relation of my cleanliness is with the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we can serve more and better than the poor or not , we cannot foully , even if the poor do good .
Even then , I have noticed that those who are working in this field are sending me the stories of their success .
But I found out two things from my Government .
After telling me what is the officers of H . . . ministry they felt that we should do something as well .
and the officers formed a plan .
Look how the changes in the government start , it is an example .
One thing he decided that if he wants to go to the specialist - abeld child then he has planned to give him a special scholarship by enjoying such a thousand good specialty - abeld child .
I congratulate all these officers of the department for their views .
I had an opportunity to go to Siachen in the past .
I spent in the midst of the dead soldiers for the country .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because of them, we are able to celebrate Diwali, so I went among them.
I realized how many difficulties he lives .
I salute the defence personnel of the country .
But today I have to say another pride .
The soldiers of our country work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamity , they are ready to do any courage to defend us .
I particularly enjoy these soldiers .
I got an opportunity now, I had organized a tea-water program from the soldiers of our country, young students, youths and women who came to play and play.
I got a new energy .
His enthusiasm, glory, I was seeing that our arrangements, facilities are very low compared to the countries, but instead of complaining, we were talking about doing something more than grief and enthusiasm.
For me in itself , the program of tea - drinking was very inspiring for these players .
To one thing I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to tell the mind and talk of my mind.
And I believe, the countrymen trust my words, my intentions.
But once again I want to repeat it from my side .
As far as black money is concerned, Black money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your master servant, this is the Article of Feath for me.
The money that the poor of India has gone out should come back, this is my committee.
Whatever the way, what the system is, there may be differences in opinion.
And naturally in democracy , but on the basis of my countrymen ' s understanding and knowledge I have , I assure you that we are on the right path .
Today nobody knows, neither do I know, nor do the government know, nor did you know the previous government know how much money is out.
Everyone keeps telling different figures in their own way .
I do not want to entangle those figures, my commitment is this, two rupees, five rupees, crores is, Arab is that whatever is good. It is the money of the poor of the country, should come back.
And I convince you , there will be no shortage of my efforts .
No correspondence will be taken .
Just keep me, your blessings.
Whatever I have to do for you, I will continue to do.
I rely on you .
I have a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
Although this kind of feeling was not me, I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers, sisters had expressed it.
He told me that you must discuss this matter in your mind .
I agree with this pain .
When I talk about the next mind, I will definitely discuss this intoxication, this drug, this drug mafia and the reason why India's young money can get a big crisis next time.
You have some experiences in this regard, you have some information, if you have saved children with this addiction, if you have some way to save, if you have played a good role, if you give me any such information, then you will bring about these good efforts to the countrymen, and we will all together create an environment in every family. Do not go on this way due to freshness, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am handling the topics in which the Government comes first to the court .
But how long will we keep things hidden
I ' m also daring . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were saying that suggest us, give us a message book, give it on Twitter, send an e-mail.
But there is a large section of the country, who do not have it or what they do.
Your point is correct .
This facility is not available to all .
So I tell you that if you want to say anything about my mind, then you listen to me on the village-village radio, then you will also send a message of mind, Akashwani, Parliament Marg, New Delhi If you give some suggestions, you will definitely reach me.
And I must take it seriously because active citizens are the biggest capital of development.
You write a letter, that means you are very active.
To talk about my mind , you should also talk about your mind .
Maybe you ' ll write a letter .
I'll try, then talk to you next month.
My effort will be, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, I will do it at 11 in the day.
So I ' m enhancing access to you .
Slowly the beginning of cold is going on .
There is a very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it very much .
My dear countrymen, today is a sacred festival of Vijayadashmi.
Several greetings of Vijayadashmi to all of you.
I will try, if possible, I will talk to you twice a month or twice a month.
In the mind of the future, I have also thought that whenever I talk, it will be Sunday and the time will be 11 in the morning, you will also be convenient and I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in bringing my mind to your mind.
Today, the festival of Vijayadashmi celebrates the festival is a festival of victory of goodness on evils.
But a gentleman of Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai sent me a mail, he said that in Vijayashmi we resolve to eliminate ten evils within us.
I thank him for his suggestion.
Everyone must think that defeating the more evils within themselves and defeating the evils, but as a nation, I think that on the holy festival of Vijayadasamy, we all resolved to get rid of the dirt and end the dirt and get victory on the festival of Vijayadasamy. We can do this resolution.
I had said one thing yesterday in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will clean themselves and upload their video to social media and they will invite nine people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, Khadi's talk comes very naturally.
You know that our scientists successfully used to reach Mars in at least spending, successfully.
Our strength is not less, only we have forgotten our strength.
Have forgotten yourself.
I mean, Swami Vivekanand Ji, who used to say one thing, remembers the same thing. Swami Vivekananda often used to say one thing.
Once she had gone to the child with Sherni, she had now grown up.
He said, hey, what are you doing
You're a lion.
They have made me big.
Look at my voice, look at the way of my conversation.
So the lion said that let me show you who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the well and told him with his own face - Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am also a lion, you are also a lion and as soon as the self-respect arose from inside him, he also started crying like that lion, the lion among the sheep.
The essence inside it got woken up.
Swami Vivekananda ji used to say this.
My countrymen, there is immense power within 100 million countrymen, there is immense potential.
We need to recognize ourselves.
There is a need to identify the strength within us and then as Swami Vivekanandaji had said, by taking that self-respect, we will go on with our correct identity, then we will be victorious and our nation will also be victorious, successful.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps that was a very emotional, big motivation of my life, that incident.
God has probably liked that family, but the boy is the responsibility of the whole nation.
Later, I was so emotionally tunted that I used to separately opportunistic for speciali abeld children in Gujarat.
Thousands of boys used to come, their parents used to come.
The atmosphere of such a belief was created and therefore I loved me, for the suggestions of Gautam Pal, which he has given, and I realized that I should share with you what I have suggested.
I also notice a story.
If you knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we do not stand ourselves, then those who show the way will not be found.
We will not get the finger holders.
We will have to start walking and I am confident that 100 million is sure to walk, will continue.
Many suggestions that come to me for a few days, people send big interesting suggestions.
Some people have said that when they start the small industry, the process of registration should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for it.
Some people have written to me and sent children to teach skill development from class VIII.
Someone has written to me that there should be a dust bean within every hundred meters, if you have to arrange cleaning.
Some people have written to me that polythene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I tell you from the front, if you send me any truth incident anywhere, which is positive, which inspires me, inspires the countrymen, if such truth incidents send me with evidence, then I will definitely talk about the mind, I will definitely reach the people of the country.
All this is the only intention to talk to me, come together and serve our Bharat Mata.
We take the country to new heights.
As soon as you come in mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came in my mind today.
Then when I meet, I will meet on Sunday, I will meet at 11 in the morning but I believe our journey will continue, your love will remain.
If you want to tell me something after listening to me, definitely get me, I would like it.
I liked to be the simple medium of the radio and the most things you talk today. I will reach far and wide.
I will reach poor home from poverty, because my country's strength is in the hut of poverty, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in mothers, sisters, young people, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
With your trust, the country will move forward.
I believe.
I trust in your power, so I trust in India's future.
Starting talking about the mind today
10 days ago, India-Matea lost their heroic sons
These paralyzed heroes, we spent ourselves in protecting hundreds of millions of Indians
The countrymen can sleep in peace, so these brave suppliers kept together night and day.
In the terrorist attack of Pulwama, after the martyrdom of the heroes, people across the country, and in the minds of people, there is an injury and resentment.
The sensitivities around the martyrs and their families have risen
In the defence of Indo-Mata, my salvation, all the brave supplements of the country, I bow down
Confronted with this challenge facing the country, we all have to forget casteism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger than ever before, stronger and decisive.
Our armed forces have always been introducing unique courage and magnitude .
To establish peace , where he has shown a wonderful ability , he has also worked to repudiate the attackers in his own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
The army has taken a resolution to destroy the terrorists and their helpers .
After the martyrdom of the heroic soldiers, the inspiring statements of his family through the media have given more force to the whole country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, also inspires us all the tongue that has been introduced in this hour of sadness.
They said , They will send their second sons to fight against enemies , and if they need to fight , they will go to fight .
The whole country is saluting Meena ji's indomitable courage of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu's wife of Jagatsingh Pur in Odisha
They have also decided to join their only son .
When the dead body of the martyr Vijay Shoreen , wrapped in the tricolor , reached Jharkhand , the innocent son said that I would also go to the army .
The word of this innocent today expresses the feeling of children and children of India
Similar feelings, our heroes are being seen in the houses of the martyrs.
Our single heroic martyr is not an exception in it, his family is not exception
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, is full of the story, inspiration of every family of the martyrs.
I will request the young-women to know what these families have shown, try to understand what they have shown.
For what happens, patriotism, what happens, we will not need to go towards the old events of history
In front of our eyes, these are live-going examples and this is the reason for inspiration for the future of India.
My dear countrymen, so long for freedom, all of us, who was waiting for the war memorial, she's going to end now
The curiosity of the countrymen about this, eagerness is very natural
Sri Omkar Shetty ji of Karnataka, Udupi on Narendra ModiApp, has expressed his happiness when the National Har Memorial is ready.
I was astonished and suffered that there was no national car memorial in India
A memorial where the virgins of the virgin soldiers who are looking for their lives to protect the nation can be kept alive.
I'm sure there must be a memorial in the country,
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been ready in such a short time
Tomorrow, i.e. on 25th February, we will deliver millions of countrymen to this national military memorial, our army
Country will make a small effort to repay its debt
Delhi's heart i.e. the place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present, just in front of him, this is a new memorial.
I believe it would be like going to a pilgrimage to the national military memorial for the countrymen .
National Military Memorial is a symbol of nation ' s gratefulness towards the soldiers who sacrificed the highest after independence .
The design of the memorial shows the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
Concept of the National Military Memorial, our Concentration Circles is focused on four cycles, where there is a picture of the journey from the birth of a soldier to martyrdom.
The flame of Amar Chakra is a symbol of martyrdom of the soldier
The second Circle is the gallantry chakra that shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers .
It ' s a gallery where the bravery of the soldiers on the walls has been wiped out
After this, the sacrifice cycle is it shows the sacrifice of Circle soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who sacrifice the highest sacrifice for the country are written in gold letters
After this, the guard shows the cycle, security.
This circle has a line of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and are convincing the citizens of the country that every moment the soldiers are deployed on the border and the countrymen are safe .
Together, the identity of the National Military Memorial will be made in a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, express their thanks, research them.
Here is the story of sacrifices that have made our lives to the country so that we can live and develop the country .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country.
In October last year, I also got the privilege of dedicating the country to the National Police Memorial
That too was a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our safety .
I hope you ' ll go to see the National Army Memorial and National Police Memorial
Whenever you go there you must shave your pictures on social media so that other people also get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this holy place, this memorial
My dear countrymen, your thousands of letters and comments to talk of mind, let me read through different means
This time when I was reading your commencement , I noticed a very interesting comment of the fire mask ji .
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda, then his age was only 25 years, it is a coincidence that Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also on March 3.
And they write further , these two personalities are completely from two different family backgrounds which enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand .
In a matter of mind , Birsa Munda and Jamshedji are like bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand .
These two great scholars have not extended the name of Jharkhand but the whole country .
The whole country is thankful for their contribution
Today, if our young men need any inspirational personality to guide, then that is Lord Birsa Munda
The British hiding, caught them very sweetly when they were sleeping
Do you know why they resorted to such a cowardly action
because the British , who had raised such a big kingdom , were afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had only shaken the English rule equipped with guns and guns from his traditional arrows and command.
Actually, when people get an inspiring leadership, then the collective will of the people on the strength of weapons is heavier.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of tribals .
They did all this in their little life .
In the dark life of the deprived and the desolate , shines like the sun .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed her at the age of 25
India's mother's son like Birsa Munda has happened in every part of the country
Perhaps any corner of India would have been such that nobody has contributed to this war of independence for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, valor and sacrifice did not reach the new generation
If, personality like Lord Birsa Munda made us understand our existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country big institutions
Jamshedji Tata was a vision in the right way, who not only saw the future of India but also laid its strong foundation
They knew well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is necessary for the future
Not only this , he also established many world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries .
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai Desai, was born on February 29
As you all know , this day comes only once in 4 years
Money of simple, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country
The record of presenting the highest budget in independent India is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai .
Morarji Desai led India efficiently in that difficult time, when the country's democratic ties were in danger
Morarji Bhai Desai shook himself in an agitation against the Emergency to protect democracy
For this , they had to pay a heavy price even in old age .
At that time the government arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
During his tenure only 44th Constitution Amendment was brought .
This is important because the 42nd amendment was brought during the Emergency, in which there were other provisions to reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, which used to violate our democratic values - they were returned.
Like the 44th Amendment , a provision of publication was made in the newspapers of the proceedings of Parliament and Assembly .
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored in this amendment also made provision that the fundamental-authorities found under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be violated even during the emergency.
For the first time it was arranged that the President will announce the Emergency on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and it was also decided that the period of emergency can not be extended more than six months at one time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was killed in 1975 by implementing the emergency, it can not be repeated in the future.
His invaluable contribution to maintain the greatness of Indian democracy, the coming generations will always remember
Once again I pay my tribute to such a great leader .
My dear countrymen, like every year, this time too there was a lot of eagerness among the people about the Padma Award.
Today we are heading towards a New India, in it we want to respect those people who are doing their job on the grass-root level expellably.
On the basis of their hard work, they are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways
In fact, they are true karmayogis, who live in public service, social service and above all, in the nation service.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who is this
In a way, I think it's a big success because these are those people who are not on T., Magaine or Sunday pages.
They are far from the world of glare, but these are people who do not care about their name, just believe in working on the ground level.
Yoga : He has won the message of Karmasu Kaushalam Gita in a way .
I want to tell you about some such people
You must have heard about the Daitari Nayak of Odisha, they are not said to be Janal Man of the Odisha, Daitari Nayak cut the mountain with his hands in his village and made the way to the canal for three kilometers, with his hard work, Irrigation and water problem ended forever
Take the Abdul Ghafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did wonderful work to revive the traditional disease painting of Kutch
They ' re doing a big job to bring this rare painting to the new generation
I gifted to former US President Barack Obama only to the Tree of art work made by Abdul Gaffur .
Among those who receive the Padma award, Shabbir Sayyid of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Maata
The way they spent their whole life in the service of the majesty , it is unique in themselves .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower victims and exploiters through the Kalangium movement in Tamil Nadu and started the community based small financial system.
Even at the age of 100 , he is training people around the world and has so far made one and a half thousand people a yoga teacher .
Famous by the name of Lady Taran in Jharkhand, Jamuna Tudu did adventurous work of taking iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites, not only saved 50 hectares of forests, but encouraged ten thousand women to unite trees and wildlife protection.
This is the pride of Jamuna ji ' s hard work that today the villagers plant 10 trees on the birth of every child and 10 trees on the marriage of the girl .
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, even though he himself is Divya, it is difficult to get an example of the work done for the upliftment of Divya women, by establishing an institution called Chakhu Women Sevakunj, they are engaged in the work of making blind children self-reliant.
Kisan uncle of Muzaffarpur of Bihar, i.e. the story of Princess Devi is very inspiring
He has presented an example to make women empowerment and farming profitable .
The farmer uncle added 300 women in his area to the Self-Delp Group and inspired them to make financially self-sufficient
He trained the women of the village with farming and other means of employment, the special thing is that they worked to connect Technology with agriculture and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time that 12 farmers have received the Padma awards in this year.
Normally , very few people associated with the agricultural world and very few people who do direct peasantry have come to the list of Padmashree .
This is the changing picture of India, in itself.
My dear countrymen, I want to talk to you about a heart touching experience that I've been feeling for the last few days.
Nowadays, wherever I am going in the country, my effort remains that Ayushman India's plan will meet some beneficiaries of PM-JA i.e. PM Public Health Scheme
He was treated with this scheme and he became a victim of accident who cares for his family by working hard and working, he got benefit from this scheme and he again became healthy, started living a new life
About twelve lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I found how much change was going on in the worst life .
If you all know any poor person who is unable to get treatment in the absence of money , tell him about this plan .
Different education boards across the country will start the process for the test of the tenth and twelfth class board in the next few weeks
All the students who examine, their parents and all Teachers are greeted by me.
A few days ago , a big event of discussion on the examination in Delhi was held at the Format of Town All .
Discussion on examination was one of its features that the various subjects related to the examination were discussed openly .
Many aspects that can certainly be beneficial for students .
All students, their teachers, parents can see the recording of this whole program on Houtube, so wish all my eam workers for the next exam
My beloved countrymen, India's talk and not the matter of festival can not happen
Normally there is no such day in our country, which does not have any importance, which has no festival
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture
A few days later the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivaratri is on Monday and when Shivaratri is on Monday, a special significance of it is filled in our mind and temple .
He discussed many subjects and his confidence was really inspiring .
During the conversation, when I was talking to a well-known young man, he said, "I am stage artistic, I am immigrant in entertainment programs, so I asked the same thing to whom do you immigrate"
So he said that I am the prime minister ' s immigrant
So I told them to look at you and I was very happy, so they did the entire immigrant of the way I talk about the mind, and the immigrant of the mind.
I am glad to hear that people not only listen to the mind but also remember it on many occasions .
I was really very impressed by the power of that divine young man
My dear countrymen, through the talk program of mind, you all have a unique experience for me
Through radio , I ' ll be in a way with millions of families every month .
Many times you talk to everyone, read your chits or listen to the ideas sent on your phone, I feel that you have considered me as part of your family.
It ' s a very pleasant feeling for me
Friends, election is the biggest festival of democracy
Next two months, we will be busy in all the elections
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Honouring the healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, all the feelings of our three months in the month of March, April and the whole month of May, I will start with the strength of your blessings once again with the strength of your blessings after the election and will start our dialogue through the mind and will talk to you for years.
Then once I thank you all very much
Dr. Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji of Sri Siddhaganga Math of Tumkur district in Karnataka was not among us
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service
Lord Basveswar has taught us Kayakve Kailash i.e. doing his obligations while doing hard work, the residence of Lord Shiva is like being in Kailash Dham.
His fame was as a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages
He was a social reformer
He put his whole life in the fact that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
Farmers should have welfare in every way, it was preferred in Swamiji's life
Siddhaganga monastery regularly organized animals and agricultural fairs .
I have sometimes been lucky to receive the blessings of the supreme God .
In the year 2007, our former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam went to Tumkur on the occasion of the Century Year Festival of Sri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for the worshipper Swamiji on this occasion .
n giveing, you receive appendence almighati will blows, all your actions. This poem of Dr. Kalam Sahib presents the mission of Sri Sri Shivkumar Swami's life and Siddhaganga monastery beautifully
Once again, I offer my reverence to such a great man
The Election Commission was established on January 25, which is celebrated as National Voter Day, National Others Day
Seeing the style on which elections are held in India , the people of the world are surprised and it is natural for every countrymen to be proud of the Election Commission .
There is no stone unturned in our country to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, is a registered voter - he gets an opportunity to vote
When they hear these things , it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission .
Keeping in mind that one voter, that voter gets an opportunity to use his franchise, for this, the entire team of EC employees goes to a far-reaching area and arranges for voting - and that is the sufficientness of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission to constantly try to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the states, all the security personnel, other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections
This year, the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time where the youth born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
There has been an opportunity to take responsibility for the country on their shoulders .
Now they ' re going to be part of the decision process in the country
It's time to connect dreams of ourselves, with dreams of the country
I urge the youth and the elders to register themselves as voters if they are eligible for voting .
It is my duty to vote together - these feelings should grow within us
For any reason in life, if you can not vote, then there should be a big pain
Sometimes you may see something wrong in the country , so you should be sorry .
I urge the country's well-known celebrities to make people aware of this by running a campaign, whether we all have a waiter registration, or voting on the day of voting.
I hope a large number of young voters will be registered as voters and their participation will further strengthen our democracy .
My dear countrymen, this great earth of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some wonderful, unforgettable works for humanity.
Our country is multipurpose
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style
On the birth anniversary of Netaji , I was very lucky to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the struggle for India ' s independence .
You know that many such rooms, buildings were closed since independence within the Red Fort.
The rooms of those closed Red Fort have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and I
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the aroma of our glorious history is settled
Talking about the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the museum, inspires us to go inside history
At this place, the British rule prosecuted the Indian mother's heroic sons Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillo and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, at the Kranti Temple, then the members of Netaji's family presented me a very good cap, cap
Never used to wear the same cap .
I kept the cap in the museum, so that the people coming there also look at that cap and take inspiration from patriotism.
In fact , the bravery and patriotism of his heroes is required to be repeated separately to the new generation .
Just a month ago on December 30 I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the right place, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is this tradition on August 15.
This was the opportunity to complete 75 years of the formation of Azad Hind government
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a heroic soldier and efficient organization .
A heroic soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom .
Come to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with desperate slogans
For many years, it has been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy about this, we can do this work
I remember the day when all the family of Netaji came to the Prime Minister's residence
We together spoke to Netaji and paid tribute to Netaji Subhash Bose .
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places connected with the great heroes of India in Delhi .
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or that revolution temple
If you come to Delhi then go to see these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, and that too is a matter of mind, I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered the radio as an important medium of joining people , in the same way Netaji also had a deep relationship with the radio and he also chose radio to communicate with the countrymen .
I was told that these radio stations, weekly news bulletins used to spread, which were in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu etc.
The programs to be broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the general public and their programmes also gave great strength to our warriors of freedom struggle .
A visual art museum has also been built in this revolutionary temple .
This has been an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive way .
There are 4 historical ehibitions in the museum and there are more than 3 century old 450 paintings and art works .
Excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloz Mukherjee have been performed in the museum.
And I will urge you to go there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
Now you might think there ' s talk of art here and I ' m talking to you about watching the best works of Gurudev Tagore
You have to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician .
But I would like to tell that Gurudev was also a painter .
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his works .
He believed that his painting seeer himself understood that painting, know the message given by him in painting from his own perspective
His paintings have also been displayed in European countries, Russia and in the US
I hope you will go to see their paintings in the revolutionary temple
My loved countrymen, India is the land of saints
Our saints have given the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and works
There were such a saint - saint Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on February 19
Saint Ravidas ji ' s dawn is very famous
Saint Ravidas ji gave greater messages through a few lines .
He said that there is a caste in caste, which can not join the utensils, Raidas man, unless the caste is snatched, the leaf below the leave and in the end nothing comes out under the leave, but the whole tree is over, just like that human beings have also been divided into castes and humans have not been there.
They used to say that if God is in reality in every human being, then it is not right to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Through his messages , Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his lifetime .
It would not be wrong to say that he has described the world as the real meaning of labour .
He used to say , if your mind and heart are holy in the Ganges in Kathauti , then Sakshata God resides in your heart .
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced the people of every section, every section, whether the Maharaja of Chittor and the queen or the Mirabai, all were their followers.
I once again bow down to Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on My Govt that I will highlight India's space program and aspects related to its future.
He also wants me to ask students to take interest in space programs and go away from the sky and think more than the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate the message given to your idea and especially for our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I got the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai
our space program contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country
We are proud of the fact that today the satellites and sounding records devoted by our students are reaching space
The Kalam set launched by our students on 24th January .
Sounding Rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made many records
As far as the country has been independent from 2014 to the space missile, almost the same space missile has started in the last four years.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft
We are soon going to register India's presence on the moon through the Hundryan-2 campaign
Our country is also using space technology to protect life.
Whether it is cyclone, or rail and road safety, all of them are getting great help from space technology.
NAID devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their safety as well as economic growth
We ' re using space technology to develop and improve government services
House for all i.e., about 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been lived in this scheme.
At the same time, about three and a half million properties were also jio-tag under MNREGA.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It contributes greatly to our better relations with many countries in the world
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also gifted development to our neighboring allies.
Through its extreme complex services, India today also launches not only developing countries but also satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars are always very attractive for children .
Our space Programme gives children a chance to think bigger and move ahead of the boundaries, which were considered impossible so far.
It is a promise to keep watching stars for our children as well as to inspire new stars to find.
My dear countrymen, I always say, who plays and plays this time in India, all the young and young players have come in front of the player.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games in India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our spots is strong , that is , when our base is strong , our youth will be able to perform the best of our capabilities in the country and the world .
This time players of every state have performed well at their own level in India.
The life of many players who win the medal is inspiring .
They live in a parking shade with their family
At the same time, the under-21 female captain of the Kabbadi team of Maharashtra is from Sonali Helvi Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali ' s skills .
Often it is seen that daughters do not get so much encouragement in sports like Kabbadi .
Despite this , Sonali chose the kabaddi and performed the best .
Asansol's 10-year-old innovative Shaw, play India is the youngest gold medal winner in Youth Games
Akshata Baswani Kamati, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka won gold medal in whightlitting
He credited his victory to his father , his father is a farmer in Belgaum .
When we are talking about the creation of India , it is only a new India of the will of young power .
These stories of Sports India are telling that not only does people of big cities contribute to the creation of New India, but youth and children coming from small towns, villages, towns, youth, youth-sporting talents, they also have a big contribution.
