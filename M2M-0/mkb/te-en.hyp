O my beloved country , worshippers .
All of you are many spectacles of Deepavali .
It is said that in this shine light brings happiness , health , prosperity in life , which shows good vision by destroying immune system .
Sahastra , Festival tourism is a special attraction of the world .
There are immense opportunities of Festival in the national festivals of India .
Therefore in encouragement of Festival Tourism in India the role of Indians living outside the country is important .
We decided that in my favorite country , Christian time we did something new to this canal in Manki Batt .
On seeing this many stories of social meditation have been recorded in social meditation .
This day our parents were in good profession .
She is actually Indian Lakshmi .
Ramesh Garh , your mother ' s parable .

Mughal ji got so much support from the hearing of this Indian Laxmi .
Many such stories are Shering .
You must read, get rid of it.
You should also share such things around you .
All these Indian Lakshmis have written a poet in the language of Kannada language in 17th century , my favorite country residents of the country , 17th century .
These emotions , those objects , Indian Lakshmis , now we are brought to everyone 's foundation there .
How important things , how important feelings , how excellent thoughts , poetry is in Kannada .
Because of the magnificence of these artificial magnificence our society is a strong identity , enthusiasm future .
My favorite country residents , 12 November , 2019 AD Sri Guru Nak Goddess is celebrated in the world 550 .
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India but also in the whole world .
In many countries of the world our Sikki brothers residents reside , they are completely unparalleled to the ideal ideal of Guru Nanak Goddess .
I can never forget the journey done by Vancour -LRB- Vancour -RRB- , Tehran Gurudwara .
I can tell you how much about Shri Gurunak God, but it has to have many episodes of Manki Baat.
They were standing at the highest place .
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the service done with emotional emotion is unparalleled .
They were opposite to social misconceptions like unconsciousness .
Sri Guru Nanak Dev had exhibited his message from far off places of the world .
Most of the journeys during their time are not one of them .
We went to many places , wherever we went , everybody has spent their minds with their silence , listening , simpleness .
Taking good , equal messages they went to all the directions in the north eastern west of the north , everywhere with the people , saints , saints .
It is believed that the well known saint of Assam Shankar Dev also got support from them .
They traveled to Holy Haridwar.
Guru Bagh is a sacred place of Gurudwara in Kashi .
It is said that Sri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also went to religious places like ' Rajgir ' , ' Gaya ' of Buddhism .

During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .

In one ' Udasi ' they also made big journeys to the countries of Islamic countries in which Saudi Arabia , Iraq and Afghanistan are also there .
They are bought in the minds of lakhs of people . those people have followed their messages with complete faith , they are still following today .
Some days Christians of approximately 85 countries have gone to Amritsar from Delhi .
There Amritsar Sir Golden Temple was visited , Guru Nanak Dev had presented to the glimpse of 550 .
All these were not only visiting Golden Temple , but also got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
Guru Nanak Goddess Garhwal 550 years of the light of his thoughts , ideals , ideals to bring in our life .
Then once I am praying to Guru Nanak God by folding the camp .
It is believed that my beloved brothers , October 31 you will definitely remember everyone .
Reading about the work style of Sardar Sahib , listening to their plan is so strong .
In 1921 to participate in the conference of Kangras in Ahmedabad everybody has to come to thousands of numbers from all over the country .
All the administrations were on the Sardar Patel .
They also used this contribution to shine the Netarvark of water supply in the city .
Whose lack of water was organised .
Not only this , if you have organised the things , shoes , shoes without thief at the conclusion place then you will be surprised .
They contacted the rails , Khadi bags were made .
At the same time Khadi Victoria also got shining .
For the role of Ulkhini utensils in the state our country has always been debted .
As if there is no chance of differences formed on the basis of Kullu , tradition they have done the main work of determining the primary hiccups .
We all know that a great Bhagirathi , historical work was organised by the first Home Shakh Mantra of India .
You know well that Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the division of India in 1947 our neighbour is situated on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Immediately after knowing this news of Sardar Patel they have taken difficult churches without old at all .
It is said that the brothers of Aryar , Arkat Ramswamy and Arkat Lakshmanaswamy of Arkat Lakshmanswamy were told that the flag hoisting flag hoisting flags with the people of Trevan Koor .
Immediately with his country Trivarna Patak had taken out the neighbouring neighbours of Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I believe that you will visit these beautiful islands , sea shores .
My favorite country residents , 31 October 2018 ' Sirdar Patel ' made in the memory of ' Statue of University ' has been discovered worldwide .
This is the highest statue of the world .
The ' State of Liberty ' of America is twice high .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .

My favorite country residents , Sardar Patel are sitting in the unit of the country .
Ikyata mantra is like our life culture . in the country with virtues like India we should strengthen the unity of unity in every way , in every way , in every market .
My beloved countrymen , our society is always aware of how much , aware of the unity of the country .
Seeing around us many such examples are found , in those examples they are constantly working to increase the mutual support of each other .
Any stories try to forget those situations according to their benefits in their own way .
How many types of words were spoken to increase the temperature in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different heavens .
Some Niwas , those who go to the great , only they are famous for their famous things .
We remember how responsible things are talking to us .
But all this happens five days , seven days , ten days , but as soon as judgment comes , a joyous , surprising change has been seen in the country .
On one side it has been done to increase the economy of two weeks , but on coming to Ramjanmabhoomi the government , political organizations , social institutions , civilizations , civilizations of all traditions , saints , saints , saints , saints .
Try to reduce temperature in the environment .
But I remember that day properly .
The dignity of judgment has been pridefully enjoyed . There is no chance of increasing temperature , hotness .
These things should always be kept in mind which gives us strength .
Those days symptoms , symptoms teach us .
This is an example of how much power gives the country to the country .
There is a big wound on the day of the country .
I also dedicate my attention to them today .
My beloved country , today the story of the house is listening to one far away from the story of every village , from north to south , from east to west , the roots of Hindustan are listening to a story .
Every person , every family , every village wants to tell his happiness related to cleanliness because the attempts of cleanliness are of hundred and thirty crore Hindus .
The fruits of these are also hundred thousand crores of Hindus .
There is a pleasant thrilling experience .
Not only to separate the garbage in it but also to organise it is very important task .
In it , removing garbage on 130 tonnes near Glacier , that is , how big service is there .
That is also a rare species of snow leopards of Ecosystem where there are rare animals like sheep , wheat colored bears .
We all know that the roots of clean water of these Siachen rivers , glaciers .
Therefore the work of cleaning here i . . people use rivers like Nubra , Shreek along with giving clean water to the lower places from here .
My beloved country , festival is a new Chaitanya in all our life .
Other Deepavali meaning mainly buying something new , it keeps happening less in the family .
I told one time to buy things available locally .
If we get necessary things in our village then we do not have to go to Talluka for them .
Once I told you many ruins of this Deepavali festival once .
For Deepavali we are of different kinds .
But sometimes salt starts coming out of carelessness .
Several ruins of me .
Blessed is many .
Manki Batt , September 2018 .
Seeing our soldiers , our soldiers , Indians are not proud to see our soldiers .
Any nation , any place , any religion , or any language every Indian is always ready to tell our soldiers , all their happiness , Madhuni .
All the Indians celebrated the traditional festival of 125 crores of Indians . 2016 the surgical Street done in 2016 .
During the war of negative war on our country in the telescope , our soldiers were given in the form of surgical strain .
How much capacity is hidden in us , how our soldiers keep protecting all the country , Manal .
In the youth of our country many days like Parakram Parvati reminds of the traditional heritage of our soldiers .
To keep our country peaceful , negativeness , such days encourage us .
I also participate in a program in Jodhpur of Rajasthan .
In the two world wars happening in twentyth century the soldiers of our country gave clean sacrifices for more than one lakh peace .
With the purpose of paying attention to peace it is a courage of our country soldiers .
India is also one of the countries sending soldiers in large numbers of peaceful Bhadrata teams of the state .
In decades our soldiers were playing role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet .
My favorite country Prajalara , sky carpets are unique .
On the 8th day of October we celebrate the air conditioning day .
In 1932 the very small air conditioning team of six steps , 19 soldiers etc . increased . This is one of the courageous , powerful air conditioning teams of 20th century .
In 1965 the enemies of enemies were also our flight team .
Who will tell about the independence of Bangladesh happening in 1971 .
In 1999 the air conditioning team has also played an important role in releasing Kargil from the ruins of the roads .
On the establishment of enemies in Tiger Hills by making a bomb in the night and night they also cut them soil .
If the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
It is unique to show them in comparison to all the natural species of carvings in the jungle from Tupa , air , floods , floods .
In the country generated eucalyptus i . . women , men are standing as an example .
Now our air conditioning team has also given the alternative of the Permanent Committee for women . August15 I prophesied this from the platform of Red Fort .
It is said that in the soldiers of India the support of the woman with the strength of man is also equal to the support of women .
As a result of the strength the woman has also become a member .
My favorite country Prajalara , some days Christian Ablash Tomi had fought with death for his life .
How to save him from the country of Yavat .
You know that Kada Abhilash Tomi is a very courageous authority .
Without using any kind of modern technique , only with the help of a small boat the Indian is the first Indian .
To participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern Indian Ocean he was moving ahead in the sea for the last eighty days but the temporary sea temporary storm brought him problems .
But these people of India had spent many days fighting with the sea .
He was the biggest example of adventurous , cultural , traditionalism . After rescued him in the sea for a few days I talked to him in phone .
Everybody knows how important is my favorite desert , October second honey for our country .
This year October is a speciality for both .
Since today we are celebrated by many programs of Mahatma Gandhi 150 Jayanti festivals worldwide .
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi gave the inspiration of Yavat worldwide .
In 1941 Gandhiji started writing some thoughts in the form of a positive program .
Later on in 1945 he made his thoughts everybody .
To save the rulers of the priests , villages , villages , students , cleanliness , education have kept their thoughts in front of the country .
It is also called Gandhi Charter Churter .
This is a special identity of his personality .
How important , important availability of this country has been understood everyone .
Then it seems as if thy suspicion is happening , thy absorption is melting .
This mantra of my favorite country Prajalara , Gandhi dynasty is still main .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , the power of shopping is increasing .
On going to buy anything we remember this mantra once again .
Because of shopping of this thing I give benefit to any Pauri in the country .
Whose heart is cheering happiness .
This is my belief that in the life of the poor , weaker person you can change greatly by putting your feet in his life .
It is said that if my favorite country Prajalara , cleanliness then freedom is available .
Although he does not know but India has come independence .
For example , in every context many people give support to the support of expensive production of expensive , expensive products .
All these expensive clothes are also not so difficult but they should be used everybody .
Loal Bahadur scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific sciences .
The ' Jai Jawan Kisan ' is a unique display of the great personality of the science of the science of the science of the science of the science .
The soldiers of his country , the soldiers of his country gave the midwives to the soldiers , the soldiers of the country .
It is common to speak about cleanliness while remembering my favorite country Prajala , these are our worshippers .
September fifteenth century has started a garden called ' Sanctuary ' .
Crores of people participate in this park . I also got the opportunity to give cleanliness to children in the Ambedakar school of Delhi .
Baba Saheb Abedkar himself installed the foundation of that school .
People of all the classes of the country participate in the suffering of this September fifteenth century .
Come on, let's hear a phone call..."
I am telling you special blessings of your phone call .
The ' Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention ' i . . Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Sanctuary ' , the pure mantras worldwide , experts of this hole come together and divide their own uses , experiences in this cleanliness condition .
With the beginning of the 150th Jayanti festival of Bapu on the second day of 2018 October this ' Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation ' is completed .
If you want to give freedom , peace , peace , justice to the people , then it is especially unnecessary .
In the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedakar many places have been done for the primary hiccups of lice .
Inspired by them, 'National Human Rights Commission' was established on October 12, 1993.
In some days NHRC has completed the breasts .
NHRC has not only saved human hakims but also worked to increase the honor of humans .
Prime minister of our Majijijijijijijijid , our favorite nature Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee George has clearly said that human hakkas are not traditional .
In the symbol of our national human handicrafts the ideal ideal ideal ideal ideal ideal of the time is ' Survey ' .
For human hakims NHRC has given an expansive opportunity to stop the ill effects of those hakims in which they have also played a role .
In this journey of breasts NHRC has made an ideal , a belief environment in the country .
I believe that for a healthy society , for the best democracy this is a big happiness .
In the national level along with human handicrafts the commission of human handicrafts of twenty six countries has also been established .
In the form of a society one has to try to understand human hakims , to understand human hakims , this is the basis of ' Sabka Sath , Sabka Vikas ' - everyone with the help of ' Absolutely ' .
In the month of my favorite country Prajalara , October , Jayprakash Narayan Garden is celebrated . In this month the festivals of Rajmata Vijayraja Sindhi dynasty start .
I will tell about them in Manki Baat , but I will definitely do this proposal . In the last Centre , Sirdar Saheb Jayanti , Aktober 31 . . . . . . . . . . .
This time also we try to make this ' Ren Fort University ' in every small and big cities , areas , villages .
The program of ' Ron For University ' is the best way to remember the Sardar Sahib .
All the efforts to kiss everything in the society through the ' Run For University ' of October 31 ' , to kiss all the places of the country with peace .
This is the righteousness which we give him .
In the context of these sacred festivals of my favorite country Prajalara , Navaratri , Durga Puja or Vijayashmi , many ruins of your heart are telling everyone with your heart .

With this I am expressing the devotion of science , education , students to you .
My beloved countrymen , labourers bring many hopes to our rails this rainy season .
Due to strong sun dry trees , plants , dry rivers .
But sometimes this rainy season also brings the floods of destroying , destroying .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains all are natural .
The dangers leaving behind them are unfortunate .
But on occurrence of dangers humanity meaning what we understand .
Everybody knows the soldiers of the soldiers of the security programs happening in Kerala .
They did not leave any opportunity to save those stuck in floods .
No matter how big role has been played in the attempts of help , protection , not a nice but armi , BSF , CSF , RAF , everybody .
I want to tell specially about the hard industry of NDRF . During such difficulties they helped so much .
Efforts made to keep the situations of NDRF , their committee , active decision to keep the situation in mind every Indian .
The festival of Ninnam is celebrated .
To come out very fast from this danger , especially the country , especially the state of Kerala to give strength to this festival , we pray for the archaeological development of the state of Kerala .
It is believed that the people of Kerala , the people of the country , the other places of the country have been associated with them , on the other hand all the people of the country .
My favorite country Prajalara , this time I see information about the information that came for Manki Baat this time I have come to me about one thing .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
From Ghaziabad , Kirti , Soni Patt , brother Pravin from Kerala , Dr . Swapn Berji from West Bengal , Akhilash Pande etc . from Katihar of Bihar , Nandra Modi Yadav , Maajid etc . are not able to speak me about various visions of life .
The world listening to the death of the sixteenth honey of August , the country has drowned in Shokasandra .
He is a great country which left the prime minister of fourteen years old .
If you want to say one thing then he went away from the royal palaces in the last teeth .
People considered him as the best parlor member , quiet architect , great , favorite leader .
Due to bringing suppression to the reproductive system the country of Atal Garden remains debted .
Due to the reason of the 91th state civilization done in 2003 our thanks always remain .
This survey has brought two main changes in the royal palaces of India .
First change is that in the number of midwives in the states the number of midwives in the state is fifteen percent .
The guests changed it .
That is why the vegetation of money was done .
Therefore the job has increased .
Because of the far-flung people like Atal Garden these conditions have started increasing healthy traditions in our royal culture .
Atal George is a true country .
In their administration changes were changed while entering the budget .
Initially according to the tradition of English parlor during the time of parlor in London , therefore in the evening the market was entered .
In 2001 ATDC changed the fifth time in the evening , in the morning 11th century .
In the same way once in the country you are watching the churches of the states , central soldiers of the country .
This is a good solution for delivery .
Healthy procedure , excellent procedure , providing good traditional tradition , continuous exercise , unsuccessful churches , etc . also give us excellent excellence to the guests .
The work of working in Lok Sabha is eighty percent , the work of the state is twenty and four percent .
These rainy seasons of parlor are always remembered in the form of social judgment , even more youths .
In these conclusions many important children useful for youth , backward classes have been adopted .
The decade of decades like SCT commission is also desired to make Ooty commission .
To ensure the rulers of the backward classes the country has fulfilled the contribution of making Orissa commission this time .
It has also given the authority of a state . social judgment which takes ahead .
That is why parlor has entered hard education by entering the parlor of the parlor .
According to this infected infected doctrines without less than teeth , training , twelve girls are done for those who do wrong .
After some days you will read in the newspapers , after information about a judgment place in Mandshoor of Madhya Pradesh only two months after information about two months in the girls .
Before that in Madhya Pradesh only five days after information in a judgment place in Kathani in Madhya Pradesh the iniquity of iniquities has fallen .
In Rajasthan also some such fast decisions have been taken there .
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the wrong things happening on women , girls .
On walking ahead for the country we can bring change in the life of poor , backward , sick , young people .
In the rainy season this time everyone has made an ideal ideal .
I tell thanksgiving thanks to all the parlors of the country in Bahrang .
My favorite country Prajalara , in these days crores of people are situated on Asia crickets happening in Jakarta .
Asia Crickets are going even more .
I am telling all the players ready for the country .
If India is fit then the future of India is built .
Together with this I want to see the best exhibition of other players as well .
Everybody 's national sports Festival is spectacular .
Besides this the country also reminds him with great pride , self-confidence .
In their memory September fifteenth honey engineers are celebrated .
The engineers of our country walking in their footsteps have cherished their existence in the world .
It's called 'Bhunga' in the kach.
This house has seen three earthquakes .
But if you see any harm at any place .
This house was built according to the environment here our ancestors .
It was said pride that it was told me that the engineers of that time were done according to the local conditions of that time , ordinary people were made such constructions to stay safe .
Now while celebrating engineers we should also think about our future .
Keep work shops at every place .
During changing we should learn some new things .
What should be taught to students .
Then we met .
In this meditation many places rains are coming properly .
Most of the rains at some places are also coming to the architects .
In some places people are waiting for rains due to no rains .
Humans brought immune system with nature .
That is why sometimes natural tiredness occurs on us .
Therefore the responsibility of natural lovers , nature has to be saved .
Twelve people in Thailand went to a cave for the tour of Junior football games , their coach .
Normally going to that cave, it takes some hours to get out.
But that day the decision of the method is different .
Not getting any way to come out they stayed near a small dip inside the cave .
Out of one , not in two days , but forty days .
On one side if they fight with danger , on the other hand Yavat has exhibited the values of human splendor of the world .
The people of the world prayed to come out safely .
Where the children were stuck , how many attempts were made to know that they were in any condition .
How to bring out the water if it is not possible to save them in the time of monsoon then it is impossible to bring them out .
Unfortunately they are safe as soon as they come to the ruins of safety , everyone has enjoyed the world .
But I considered how this protection program was done in the second sight .
The complete responsibility seen in every level is unique .
Government , children , parents , their family members , media , people of the country have also seen peaceful , courageously .
In this entire behavior a pocket of the Dhaiyaland river has also lost its lives .
If we work on our goal with peaceful , stable mind then it is enough .
For a few days Christianity the favorite poet of our country had left us .
Our Indians can also give strength to every monastery , inspiration .
This is the time to start art galleries .
The youth coming to July asks the most important part of their life where their eyes turn towards Kat - Africa from questions .
The students change from home to hospital .
The students come into the shadow of professors from the shadow of parents .
It is believed that my young friends keep on keeping their lives very happy , enthusiasm .
For the first time out of the house , go out of the city , separate from a fragile environment , this is the time you have to turn yourself into stuff .
How many youths leave their houses for the first time , come out to give a new direction to their life .
I told everyone that stay peaceful , spend life completely enjoy your mind in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , to mix friends , to mix those friends , to mix those friends which have to be done with very knowledge .
New epidemics , new languages .
The student of Ashram Chaudari of a Nirodh family of Madhya Pradesh had successfully crossed all the difficult competitions of his life .
Jodhpur AIMS Taluku was successful in the first attempt of MBBS test .
His father used to fulfil his family by working to collect garbage .
My favorite country Prajalara , some days Christians have attracted a architect associated with my eyes .
If we read inside then we try to bring change in the life of normal person using our youth technology .
In America once I am celebrated with Indian youths once in Sanjoj city called technology Hab .
I want to do something for the country by thinking how to use their everybody for India .
By using their professional experts both of them have been made a memorial ypnotise .
Apart from contacting the people of this village with Yavat world they have to give any advice , information about this , if they have to give information about it in their own mobile .
In a way in this Yap village attempts to bring digital opposite to the development works happening in the village by this Yap , doing tracking , making a market is easy .
In this Yap the phone diary of the village , archaeological department , Jabita , health center , information center .
If you want to know FACT race between the village officers of this Yap , then it is useful for their production Market flash .
If you are constantly discovering this thing then one thing will be understood that those youths are spending life in America , there life style , thoughts , thoughts , many years old ages have also been kept in mind the small things of their village .
That is why they can do something properly in the village .
Situated with their village , this relation with its corner , for any country it is natural in every Indian .
But sometimes because of time , far , situations , because of which a thin smoke gets stuck on it , but if someone has a small salt then all the things inside come out again .
Pandarpur is a sacred village of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
A fifteen , twenty days before Ashdakshi , Varkari i . . Tirthankaras , along with palanquins the pilgrimage of Pandirpur pilgrimage comes out on foot .

Innumerous meditations like Gyaneshwar , Namdev , Eknath , Ram Das , Tukaram etc . are still training common people in Maharashtra .
Their main folk music reservoirs are Bharud or Abhinga which we get the message of goodness , love , beauty .
Due to this the society is available to fight against the faith of the mood .
The power to see them wrong for the British rulers , Chaturya is in him .
The Englishmen try to stop the kingdom three times in twenty years .
This is not a small thing .
A interesting incident about a Tilak statue situated in Lokmanya Tilak , Ahmedabad is divided with the people of this country .
It is said that on the death of Lokmana Tilak George in 1920 August , Ahmadabad his memorial statue was refreshed .
Sirdar Baalbhai Patel Ahmedabad city has been selected as Mayar . along with this he has chosen Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmani Tilk Garden . This garden is named Britain .
Finally the statue was built . Sardar dynasty besides whom the statue was done with Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February , 1929 .
The most important thing is that in this garden in the council of that garden worshipped Bapu is that after coming to Sardar Patel a person of Ahmedabad city apart from his archaeological idol is also possible .
Because of the efforts of Lokmana Tilk Garden the tradition of social festivals started .
These social festivals along with traditional category , festival , social awareness , social awareness , equality in people have become an effective medium of moving ahead .
This is also known because of our old heritage , history standing in the history of our old heritage , how much favorite is in our youth .
Today in many cities we are seeing to worship the statues of Ganesha in almost every street .
Together with a team the worships of all the people living in that street are organized .
This is the unknown opportunity of our youth where they learn the qualities of nervous system , negligence etc .
Beautiful milk , developed fruits should be given to every Indian .
He also sacrificed his life with the self-confidence of breathing throughout the country .

Due to the reason of the mountainous area these fruits are not available properly .
The rails of Kapkot region have found out the way to increase the price -LRB- increasing rate -RRB- by selling these fruits directly in the market .
Because of the excess of iron minerals in all these fruits this iron elements are very beneficial for pregnant women .
All these rails in Munnar village have been built a government institution , where these biscuits were opened .

The price of science and technology is stable .
There is no price for them .
Every instrument does the same thing as we want .
But by the instrument we do any work depends on us .
Human goal is important here .
Science should also be used not only for human safety but also to climb the best peaks of human life .

The fourth honeymoon National Safety Day , therefore the chief minister told some precautions about Bhadrata in his Manki Bath program , to increase the chances of Bhadrata in people .
In daily life we are not unsuccessful about Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get Bhadrata at the time of dangers .
In them - because of lack of concentration - danger happens - one wrong harms - joy , joy , joy , joy , joy , joy , joy , joy , joy , joyousy , joy , joy , joyousy , joy , joyousy , joy , joy , joy , joyousy , joyousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousousous , .
By crossing that path all the times in our life can not be used .

That means.
But we should pay attention .
That is why not sit in the air , our ears are listened to precautions , but it is said that it is ' our desire ' .
We want to stay in every hole of life .
We should not think that this Bhadrata is not for us .
If we are unsuccessful for our Bhadrata then society Bhadrata is also under it .

My beloved countrymen, the fifth day of December, World Soil Day.
This contribution I want to tell some things with my brother , sister , sister .
The most important part of the earth is soil .
The symbol of eating is contained with this soil .
One way the whole food chain is covered with soil .
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life possible .
How to live the cost of animals .
Before this thing has been discussed in our culture . This is the reason that we are the best time for the importance of soil .
In our culture on one side of our culture , on the other side the natural attempts of devotion , observation , voluntary feelings , voluntary feelings have also been done . On the other hand some scientific methods have become part of our life .
Both of our soil devotion , scientific protection of soil , protection of soil are also important in the life of this country .
In our country the rails are tied with tradition , to show interest towards modern science , to encourage us all pride .
I have heard about the rails of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh , Tohu village , Bhoraj Black .
It is said that some rails of the village have considered the situation of poisoning with the best time to test their soil , some kind of red , microbes , microbes , microbes , microbes , microbes , microbes , microbes .
After that you will surprise to hear the results .
At the same time the soil also got shining in the soil .
If we want to think about the fruit then precaution should be precautionary to the earth . If we save our land , then we also know that the landmass saves us all .
All our resources of the country understand their soil even more properly , according to which the fruits were taken on ten crores of soil health cards .
We worship the mother of the earth but how bad the health of the earth becomes so bad whenever we think .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that due to the reason of more than necessary redness the earthquake gets harmed .
Global warming , changes in the environment , we all feel .
Sometimes before Deepavali the winters were coming in the winters . Now the winters coming slowly .
But as soon as winters we do not come out of the rage of all of us . This is the experience of all of us .
Because of this child talking about cleanliness by going to 30,40 houses everyday one gets rid of the excretion of Bahraang village of Kumahari village .
In the direction of increasing cleanliness the small child did how inspirational work .
There is no time to play cleanliness , there is no limit .
Children , elders , women , men are important for everyone cleanliness .
Everybody needs to do something for cleanliness .
Our Divya brother , Sodrimans are strong .
Sufficient , adventurous . can contact anything .
One can learn something from them every moment .
They are queening in every hole .
In any social problems in playing , in some social problems our brothers do not take anybody .
You will remember , in Rio Olympics our Divya players , unknown games have spent four times .

Before this festival on washing the whole house , cleaning the whole house , on the banks of the river , river , pond , worshipping rivers also clean very enthusiasm .
It is natural to consider everybody pride towards this great tradition of India .
But when I see the effect of words in ' mind ' then I am considered to be a hundred percent strong binding with the people of the country .
Take the example of Khadi , doing .

In all the girls of Khadi , handicrafts also the lower year of this year approximately nine percent old age has been registered .
In the middle of this youth , elders , children , elders , elders , women , all elders are also liked .
That is why I can imagine how much benefit is done for family members , many poor families .
Now, I think Khadi for fashion, Khadi for niceness, Khadi for fashion for all the two places of Khadi for transformation.
Not only bringing change in the life of the carbohydrate , but also the strength to bring them up with the breathing power , both are changing .
How to give the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .

After two days of my favorite country Prajalara , after two days we are celebrating the birthplace of Sadar Baalbhai Patel .
Everybody knows that the foundation of modern India was done by these .
How much of this can we learn from the extraordinary journey of India .
On 31 October 31 M . . Indira Gandhi had left this preservation .
And he said unto him , In doing counsel , he is good .
Sirdar Baalbhai Patel standing on all the sides of India .
Crores of Indian residents have been determined to bring India under a country , one state .
His decision has given him the power to face all the obstructions .
Where there is need of psychological importance worked with psychological problems .
Where the use of force is necessary it has been done .
They decided a goal that they were moving ahead with complete artificiality towards that very determination .
This program can be done everybody .
Everybody has imagined the country like that of equality .
I want to stay inspiration for all of them - we should not stop the difference between palms .
This story of Sirdar Garden is also inspirational , related to our New India dream .
Because of this their Jayanti is celebrated the fifth day of the country .
His support is unforgettable in giving a form of a unforgettable form to the country .
After my favorite country Prajalara , Deepavali Shells , with new conclusion , you will start again in your daily life .
All the people of my generation want to want all their dreams , ruins .
Through the sky you have spent three times while talking to everyone in your mind .
In such a situation the word in the mind is 36th .
These things have not been told in my mind .
In this mind I have sent the words of the four corners of the country .
Many of them inspire me .
Many people are like bringing changes in the government .
Some people are like the opposite opposite opposite to some social problems .
I take your time once in a month , half an hour but people keep reaching their words for words in ' mind ' for thirty days in a month .
That is why the journey of this three third heart is the journey of all the people of the country , feelings , feelings .
In such a short time I am telling thanks to all the people of the country to understand the common opinions of India .
Now three thirds have been completed therefore social scientists , university , researchers , media specialists have done its poison .
But such poisonous churches are very useful in the future in the mind . a new enthusiasm gives everything .
After that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths have come to me .
I have come in my sight how many people who want to use it in one place , how much happiness has come to me , how much happiness has come .
On the second time I told everyone in the mind about it seeing the photograph of ' Selphy with Dr . ' taking a surprise in Haryana .
Seeing that not only in India , Yavat has started a big garden named ' Selphie Wildlife Sanctuary ' in the world .
This is not just the subject of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self-confidence in every girl .
Everybody felt that parents should take selphy with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in herself , it is believed that she has its importance .
I am sitting in their tourism department for some days Christian Government of India .
It is said that if we go to India -LRB- unparalleled India -RRB- going to the journey then take photographs there .
Then lakhs of pictures coming to India from the mouth areas of India , in one way the work of tourism has remained very big .
I experienced by words in mind how big incidents can lift up a small accident .
On coming to the thought of three third three things many incidents were straight in my mind .
To walk in the right direction the country is always before .
It is said that every Pauru , along with Pauri Hitt , for the society of the society , for the progress of the country , something or the other .
This is my three ' Manas ' which is known , learned , learned from the people of the country .
This is the biggest energy of any country , the biggest energy .
I am worshipping all the people of the country with heart .
I am talking about Khadi once in my mind . Khadi is not a cloth , a thought .
Discounts are given in Khadi girls about two October . many people get less .
I want to increase this Khadi procedure in such a way that I want to increase it again .
Because of the increase in zeal of Khadi , in those working in Khadi Rang , the enthusiasm of thinking in a new cell in the government of India has also increased .
How to bring new technology , how to increase the energy of production , how to bring the handicrafts working with superstition , how to bring 20-20 , 25-25-30 years old tradition of old tradition .
The chances of many people have been produced .
Khadi and rural industries closed in the pumpor of Kashmir have started returning to the training center of rural industries . There is a lot of work in Kashmir to give this kind .
Now in the beginning of training centres it helps in making new generations , in the construction of new generations , in the construction of new things , in the middle of this big corporate institutions have been very happy to give me a lot of happiness .
People also began to choose expensive things while giving each other .
Some things naturally go forward and we all came into experience .
In the mind of my favorite country people , in the mind of Christian month we decided to celebrate cleanliness festival throughout the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti .
Our pride President George started this program .
Children , men , women , women , cities , villages , everybody has become part of the publicity .
As I say that we are able to conduct this procedure as if we are moving forward in front of our eyes .
Everybody adopted this proposal , helping it , giving support to successfully .
Therefore I told thanksgiving thanks to the presidents of the ornaments .
Along with them every class of the country is also considered to be their own work . Everybody has been celebrated with this procedure .
They , scientists , schools , art galleries , university , rails , officers , polices , girls , girls , boys , boys , girls , everybody has joined with it .
If these places are stiff then people are seen to be unable to swim .
It is very good that in the four days started the ' clean service ' more than fifty lakh people , more than forty thousand people have become part of this program .
Some people are constantly working with the goal of showing results .
This time we also considered new things - one side works , while taking precautions without running on the other side .
If you want to change cleanliness in a form , then it is also important for Bhavogue park .
This time many competitions have been done by the services of cleanliness .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have been made pictures .
The pictures of cleanliness have been put on their own imagination .
When we talk about cleanliness then I forgotten to tell them blessings of media .
We are seeing how much service of electronic media , Prince media , country in our country .
In this meditation someone told me about the youth of Bilal Dar of Srinagar .
If you want to make this Bild Dar of Sri Nagar archaeological Survey then you will rejoice that he is of Brand Ambassador i . . hero of Sini Rang .
Not only this .
Bill Dar has payed attention to his twelve-three years of age , last five years of cleanliness .
He is inspired to all those who are interested in cleanliness in the age .
I am giving many impressions of Bilal Dar .
We accept that my favorite country Prajalara , future history , last history .
This time Najiji Garden , Pandit Din Dayal Garden is also the year of the century .
Do not know what is the center of all these great men .
One common thing in everyone is that to live for the country , to do something for the country .
The mouth of Nanaji country has left the life of Rajiki dynasty , if they are celebrated in the work of rural life then it is natural to have the pride of their village program .
The president of India Majijijijijid President Abdulla Garden speaking with the youths of the country Najiji 's mouth related to the development of the country .
Like Mahatma Gandhi Garden Din Dayal meditation also used to talk about the person sitting in the last gallery of the society .
We also run for unity , one should move ahead .
We are normally telling the speciality of India in diversity .
We pride the diversity but sometimes you try to feel this diversity .
Deepavali is falling near Deepavali .
Everybody is a common thing to go to tourism .
But because of the painful thing , people do not see our country , do not know the opinions of the country .
Our country is filled with many varieties .
All these Mahabharatas have also been developed in the country .
Before starting this work , attempts have been made to understand India .
India has been trying to live in itself .
My self-confidence is that I have got the opportunity to go to maximum districts of India .
I got the opportunity to spend the night in more than four hundred districts .
I want to feel all the unparalleled power of this large India , our unparalleled power of India , not only in diversity .
One India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power of our country tourism .
My opinion is that you want to go out in your holidays , changes , changes , understand what should be understood , learn that with the purpose of learning .
View India inside you .
Your life will be rich with these experiences .
Your thought is huge .
There is cost of cost of experience .

Many things of my favorite country , one man , many things melt me .
My mind becomes victim of obstruction .
Leaves adverse effect on my mind .
No matter how much I am human like you .
Why is the Assamese say that while eating the mother of India their husbands are not heavenly .
In young age if the child becomes chest then how can we imagine the situation of his mind .
With the education of education of her hard industry for eleven months she gave her life to fulfill her husband dreams .
Although Nidi Dubey 's husband Mukhsh Dubey had forgotten the dead body working in the army .
His wife reached the army as well .
Every Indian is natural to have the pride of our mother 's strength , our pride towards these virtues .
I tell many ruins of these two brothers in the heart of these two brothers .
They gave new inspiration to the people of the fort of the country , new excitement .
These two brothers have many impressions .

O my beloved country , O ye sons of Sadar .
On the one hand, it is natural to worry about the country when hysterical news comes from some corner of India.
This is the country of the country of the country of Buddha Bhagwan , Gandhi 's birthplace of the country .
The ' Ahimsa Paramo Dharamshala ' . We came to say that we were listening to it for small time .
I also told from Red Fort - It is not associated with the name of beliefs that it is not associated with the traditional belief , royal thought Talluku , if a person is faithful , traditional faith .
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedakar , every person has all kinds of arrangements for getting justice .
It is believed that those who take the chatti in the hands , who take him in the Hinsar road , if they are a person , they are not able to support this country .
Our festivals are also filled with many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of some thousand years old cultural heritage , cultural traditions , historical incidents , historical incidents , everything is done daily with any festival in the year .
All our festivals also come according to nature .
Everything is related directly to nature .
The whole year of Jain society is celebrated .
The Jain society celebrates the festival of men in the month of Bhadrappa .
The festival of Purushu festival is held on the day of Akhri .
Actually this is a unique tradition .
The festival of the year is a symbol of forgiveness , ahimsa , Sneha .
My favorite country Prajalara , today everybody is celebrating the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi .
On coming to Ganesha Chaturthi it is natural to come to Bahrang - Ganesh Festival .

After independence they stand symbol of education , social awareness .

This festival tells social , cultural importance .
Onam festival shows the importance of cultural heritage of Kerala .
With the message of love and equilibrium in this festival new enthusiasm , new hope , new faith in the minds of people .
Now our festivals also change their attractions of tourism .
Durga festivals in Navaratri festivals , Bengali , Durga Puja festivals have changed their attractions in Gujarat .
Our other festivals also use to attract foreigners .
In that direction we should think what we can do .
In the tradition of these festivals ' Id-ul-Juha ' festival is celebrated in some days .
The ' Id-ul-uha ' of all the people of the country are many ruins , impressions .
Festival meaning faithful , faithful symbol .
Festivals should be made symbol of cleanliness in Navbharata country .
This is not new for us but it is important to convert it into a social habit .
The cleanliness meaning cleanliness is not only in the house but in the entire village , in the entire village , in the city , in the state , in our country clean , clean , clean fashion of our country .
My favorite country Prajalara , modern meanings are changing .
In these days how many acquaintances you are , how new your thoughts are so new , all of them have become a new corners , a new corners , a balance .
Therefore on the day of this festival everywhere the suitable soil of environment has started .
If you see the guests in the youth , then in every house the children are making soil of soil and its colors are asked .
Some vegetables are not colored , some colorful papers are put .
The media House also gives inspiration to the people giving training to the idols of the Ganges according to the environment at a height .
See how big changes have come .
Funny change.
Although I told that our country is filled with hundreds of marvellous thoughts .
Somebody has a lot of enjoyment by doing new voluntary activities .
Some engineer himself told me , he gave me some special kind of soil , mixing it , education to the people making soil .
After the worship if the idol is sucked in a small baket then the idol melts immediately in water .
I started the cleanliness of three three creams . October coming to it is completed two three times .
These parks are seen consequences of Talluku .
The construction of toilets reached about 39 to 67  .
It is said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahrang has been freed from excretion of excretion .
In the middle of Gujarat dangerous floods have come .
Many people lost their lives .
But after the increase of flood water a lot of odour is spread .
At such a time in Dhanera in Banaskanta district of Gujarat , Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind workers were cleaned by two guides , three mosques .
Everybody saved their sweat .
Trying to be dedicated to scientific emotional nature then our country can climb up with others .
Similarly Deepavali , Navaratri , Durga worshipped it .
Go to the nearby villages , go to the nearby villages but it is considered a glimpse .

'My beloved countrymen, 'Prince Prime Minister Jan Dhan John', Financial Inclusion, is discussed not only in India but also in the world's economic world.
On 2014 August 28th August I started this procedure with one of my mind .
On 28 August this ' Prime minister Jan Dhan John ' starts completion of three thirds .
The new families of thirty crore new families were opened by this .
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
He changed the habit of habit . he is going to the bank .
But now due to the environment of the evening he is also considered to be working for the needs of the children .
It is understood that in the days of coming if you want to do good work then money will work .
The poor now seeing the rubber card of his pocket , seeing himself like rich people . If there is crade card in the pocket then it is satisfied that there is card in my pocket .
It feels its pride .
In the main prime minister John the population of our poor people have become estimated about 65 thousand crore rupees in Bangkok .
Similarly this is their strength in the days of the poor .
Who has become expensive by the main prime minister John , they have also benefitted Bima .
On the occurrence of lice , if the main person dies in the family , then in some days he gets two lakh rupees .
January , insulins , rubber card , prime minister Mudra Point , ordinary people have been benefitted .
I will make complete attempts to reach them .
Due to such inspired incidents the media can also get complete benefit .

In rainy season the mind of man remains very paralysis .
Animals , birds , birds , medicinal herbs , nature , everybody becomes excited due to rains .
Due to changing weather changes are coming in environment . its effect is also very fast .
In the last few days due to the immense risk of natural risks in some places of Assam , north-eastern regions of India , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal .
The members of my friends of the midwives also reach that place .
State governments also provide best support to the problems of flood in their own methods .
In such a situation the citizens working with social institutions , cultural institutions , services are helping them properly .
The Government of India is happy to help their lives in such a time when the Government of India is able to help their lives .
Due to flood life becomes very unsuccessful .
Pulses , animals , civilizations , roads , electricity , information etc all are affected .
Especially when we have destroyed our brothers , fruits , fruits , they have made plans to do climate centres immediately for the companies , especially for fruits .
To face the situation of floods 24 hours Control Room Help Line works continuously 1078 .
People are also telling their problems .
Slowly we also do our work according to the information of this environment , we can save us from harms .
While making a word in ' Manas ' I am making more people of the country more than me .
I am very impressed by listening to your Chartered accounts .

Definitely the world researches on this thing .
All the decisions have been taken concentrated by the state , central governments .
What kind of weight should not be weighed in the lice is the result of the concentration of that concentration .
Whatever thing was before the jeeep T . . . , in today 's new situations how much of that price is all that you can know directly through your mobile phones in jeeep .
It has played an important role in increasing faith between the government , businessmen , businessmen .
It is said that all the midwives participating in this program , all the parts , central governments , state governments have told my heart .

If you want to say one way , this is a social collection park .
On the second time I am making the fort of all the people of the country easily to victory so big attempts .
Beloved country residents of my country , August i . . the month of Victoria .
In 1920 August the support of support started naturally we were listening to the small time .
On 9 August 1942 ' ueen India park ' started which is also called the revolution of August .
The independence of 15 August 1947 came to the country .
If seen in a way , all the incidents happening in the month of August are also tied mainly with the history of freedom fighting .
We should know what happened in August 9th December in 1942 .
The people of the country have been kissed with the independence of 1857 to 1942 for independence , which is the inspiration of the construction of India .
Lacs of Indians have run their life in the flow of garden with the mantra of ' Archaeology ' on Mahatma Gandhi ' .
Lacs of youths stopped their studies , leaving books .
Maha men like Lohia , Jai Prayag Narayan had played a big role in the park .
In 1920 AD the aim of support , in 1942 ueen India park , both of these also show us two forms of Mahatma Gandhi .
As a result of the support of support the progressive progressive progression has increased so fast in 1942 , Mahatma Gandhi has also given the mantra of ' Archaeology ' .
Once the history of India , I think that the first independence of India started in 1857 .
Then the initial freedom struggle was happening some corner in the country of 1942 .
This Sudigarh period has created an independence in the minds of the country .
Everybody has become responsible for the decision of doing something or the other .
This industry done in 1857 AD has reached the last stage of 1942 .
The garden of ueen India has changed so much that in the other five decades the English had to leave the country in 1947 .
1857 dynasty reached all the people of this independence park of 1942 .
Besides this in 1942 along with the five decades of 1947 all the people were decided with one mind , successfully to give freedom to the country .
These five storeys are like a thread .
Now I will meet you with a past .
We got freedom in 1947 .
Now 2017.
About fifty years have passed .
Governments came .
Arrangements have been made , marrow , increased .
Everybody tried in their own way to get out of the problems of the country .
If I have spent then the five dates of 2017 dynasty are also like that of the five dynasty .
Try to fulfil them .
Although from 1942 to 1947 the five decades of the country were miles for freedom .
These five , i . . 2017 AD to 2022 . should also be done for the future of India .
After five years we celebrate the freedom movement of the country .
Therefore we should make a strong alternative .
You should do our contribution year 2017 .
Every Indian , social institutions , local institutions , schools , art galleries , various institutions , everybody is also contacted for ' India ' .
Come , we are part of this cultural festival .
We are not where we are , therefore we are definitely in the online , therefore I am especially in the world , my youth friends , my youth friends , my young friends , their creative ways to come forward to give support to the creative ways of India .
Use of technology bring video , Posts , Blags , trade , new thoughts .
This procedure was a population .
In Narendramodi App also we are discovering ' ueen India ueen ' for young friends .
This queen is useful to introduce freedom fighters associated with the history of our country .
I believe that you will spread all the directions by making a proposal to this effort .
My favorite country residents , August 15th honeymoon the opportunity of speaking with the people of the country from the Red Fort .
In the Red Fort the voice of hundreds of old people resonates .
Try to give the form of words to the dreams . In the last three third three decades of the country I should talk about what things , advice is being given .
This time also I invited you to send your thoughts to MyGov or Narendramodi App.
In the last three third August I heard that my reproductive delivery takes a long time .
Therefore I decided that this time my progress was lessened .
Beloved people of my country , I proposed other things .
In the economy of India there is a social economic science .
We should never take it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not only enjoyable .
Our festivals , our festivals are also social cultural heritage .
But along with this our festival is also tied directly with the economic life of Pauri .
In some days Raksha Bandhan , birthplace , Vinayak Chauti , after that Chauti Chandra , Attached Chandra , Durga Puja , Deepavali .
Rakhi starts making Rakhi in small domestic industries in lakhs of families before Rakhi associated with economy .
The trade of thousands of people making Rakhis , Rakhis selling , making sweets , thousands of people daily trade is covered with a festival .
The families of our poor brother , brothers , brothers and sisters were spent due to which they were spent .
Not only the festival of lights but also the festival brought to the house .
Its relation is tied directly with the poor families making small soil .
But I want to talk about the economic arrangement of the poor people lying with those festivals , with which I want to talk about environment as well .
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are more unforgettable , active .
In the last month the best people have told me about environment .
125 years , 125 crore people of the country .
At the same time we say that for environment conservation environment friendly Ganesh i . . we worship the soil Ganapati .
I tell many acquaintances for the festivals of different festivals of all the country .
Beloved people of my country , education , economic , social area , playing games , playing games , playing the name of our girls , giving new goals to the country .
All the people of our country are also pride to see our girls .
For some days Christian women of our country have displayed unique games in the world competitions .

I enjoyed talking to them very much , but I have seen that they are not able to spend the world camp .
In their mouths also those depression , pressure has been seen .
If the players of India were smitten then we saw many sports to break on them with anger .
If you are not able to spend the match , then you have spent the heart of 125 crore people .
I told those players . Actually in our country youth , especially our girls .
On the second time I tell the youth of the country , especially our girls , my heartbeats , ruins .

Continuous awareness is important for the delivery therefore we should take care of the matters of distressing the delivery .
First of all in the matter related to delivery .

I want to give you a question .
Whether it is possible for us to become impossible in the country .
I had the opportunity to remind me of reminding the recognization of the recognization of the recognization of the recognization .
If I am the main minister in Gujarat then I decided to give books instead of flowers or welcomed with handicrafts .
Immediately I started giving those countries to the government .
Gradually it should become a part of our nature .
One flower dries up for a while .
Once we take it in hand , leave it again .
I am describing such stores which have historical value .
Last year when we went to London then British queen Elizabeth called me to eat .
The ruins made of cotton were shining in her eyes at the time of giving me .
On the day of his married lips the Mahatma Gandhi had given him the ruins of this hand , in the marriage of his marriage it remained .
The beauty of Mahatma Gandhi is surprising to take care of the houses of Elizabet queen .
Because of the smaller giving Mahatma Gandhi , she remained a historical object in her life .
I know that such good habits come at night .
There is complete transparentness .
It is necessary to discover the descriptions of the people registered in Egypt .

Sports play a unique role in the development of personality .
Sports are very important in the construction of the person .
There is no dearth of any part of our country .
If children liked in our families then give opportunity to the sports in the field .
By bringing water from the field of sports , it is not possible to convert the book worms by binding in the room .
Together with studies they should also encourage all the places in the school , art gallery , family members in the school .
In the context of Raboe Olympics all Indians should move forward in the direction of new dreams .

This sacred Ranjan is helpful in moving ahead of peace , unity , emotional way .
I told everyone again .
I am very happy to give it to many people .
Everybody has discovered enthusiasm to tell his things .
I could not read everything , I could not listen at least everybody 's message . All the messages came .
But I have seen contact that some attempts have been made to learn music , some attempts are trying to learn new things with the help of youth , some attempts are trying to learn new language .
Some are learning , some are learning dance , some are learning , some are also started writing poets .
Try to know about nature , to understand , to understand .
I want to listen to you as well .
That is , I am talking to Diksha Katil .
The habit of reading me was completely .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the struggle then I understood that how much to give freedom to India , how many sacrifices have to be given , all the freedom fighters spent in the jails .
I was influenced by the Kirti Singh in the young age .
Therefore I want to give a message to the youth about this matter .
To know about the history of our country , about our independence warriors , to know about their lives for the country , to show our youth very happy .
The number of great men lost their youth in the jail .
In the fight of freedom fight any great man spent in the jails , reading , writing etc . have done many big works .
We know that all the creations of India have also given a lot of power to India .
I went to see the Cellular Jail of Andaman - Nicobar .
The poets used to come on the walls .
He was bound in a small dark room .
O thou that lovers of freedom have experienced any thing
When I read the book of ' Savarkar Garden ' , I am interested to see Selur Jail .
There is also a light picture sound show, which is very inspirational.
I told the youth of the country that how many problems were experienced for freedom we got independence , how many difficulties were seen , seeing Sallar Jail , why do I want to go there .
If you are also possible , in a way definitely go to this pilgrimage related to our freedom fight .
The favorite people of my country , June is one Monday in 5 months .
If you want to say in another thing then back to basics .
If you want to see nature , increase the betel plaint .
Who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi Greek .
The Mahatma Gandhi guys often said, "One musst car out a World One will not see".
That is , we should also think about the world , take precaution .
You will keep on watching , the power of nature is that when a glass of water comes very tired then how fresh water comes on the mouth .
On getting tired properly opening the windows of the room , opening the doors , fresh air comes new care .
That is why the attempts of the world to kiss with 5 nature of June should also be given our own attempt .
The result of our ancestors protecting environment is now available .
It is said that physiotherapy is the cause of cleanliness in us .
It is a matter of coming to the door of Lord Buddha that the birth of Lord Buddha , his knowledge was achieved , his Mahapirvana was under one tree .
Reading , reading , cities , villages , tribals , everybody 's natural worship , natural love is a part of their social life .
But we need to contact this thing with modern descriptions , modern thoughts .
I am giving cobras from the states .
It is that in approximately all the states rains started , big plants start the program .
Plants are planted in crores .
Yoga is not only exercise .
Keeping in mind the daily yoga festival for two days I came to all the governments of the world , everybody in the world .
I declared some competitions related to yoga in the year of Christ .
Slowly the tasks move ahead in that direction .
It is a very interesting advice .
Mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , son , daughter , daughter , one three generations of yogasana should be done by putting yogasanas .
Today , today , today this beautiful yoga provides a new dimension to yoga . I am telling thanks to those who give this advice .
As soon as we got a good interesting experience through ' Selphie Wit Doter ' method .
These three waves of yogasanas give opportunity to the country , worldwide .
Where three waves they have done yoga , they have done yogasanas together , you must send me photographs of yogasanas .
In a way it should be called the prevalent health car .
Since then I have toured various kinds of efforts in India .
As soon as I returned I noticed what some were doing very minutely , where are the Modi going
If you hear this phone call then you will also understand it .
Modi Garu , I am seen in the middle of TV , Soshil media often that people are taking special care of cleanliness everywhere .
On Mumbai , Surat , Surat . people are considered to be a brightness of purifying the crowd .
The pure Talluku published from Kashi Ghat has become a garden with your inspiration . Your words are true .
Wherever I go somewhere the government will do the program of cleanliness of the government but in this society also has become a festival of cleanliness .
Five days before going , seven days before , ten days before , very big clean programs are organized .
Do not know all these things of the country as much as possible , do not take care of this thing , how much enjoyment you can imagine .
I am also telling all those who encourage this clean program .
Somebody gave me advice .
The advice of reality is very much .
I am not able to do it .
Modi Garu , when you want to decide your tourism , what kind of tourism do you want to call them ' Babu ' , how much is your cleanliness level
The treatment is very good but I should think .
But such a garden should be made . It is very good thing to give so many tonnes cleaning so many tonnes .
By doing this many people are saved from the diseases .
With the help of the state government , with the help of the presidents of the cities , the Government of India has decided to start a important program about the construction of vanity .
On June 5th day of the world environment day , about 4 thousand cities of the country are available to be useful in the form of liquid , fluid .
Both kinds of trees are available . One green colored diabetes , another blue colored diabetes .
All these work properly in the fields . fields are green , it is remembered that everything is remembered in thousands .
The other type of garbage , iron , iron , glass clothes , plastic , polythene , broken diabetes , rubber , metal etc . come into the dry area which has to be put in the instruments .
In the last few days you will hear . Versova beach has become a clean , beautiful Versova beach in Mumbai .
Together with approximately eight - nine weeks the city residents changed the form of this Varsova beach . thousands of tonnes were removed from that place then the Varsova beach became clean , beautiful .
Its full responsibility has been taken by Versova Residents Volunteer -LRB- VRV -RRB- .
Sri Afroz Shah was built in this work in October 2015 . slowly this program was changed very big , progressive .
In my favorite country Prajalara , last fifteen months of the last fifteen months , TV Channels , Soshil media , three third people are counting the government .
Three third creams have given me the responsibility of ' Prince Service ' .
Many symptoms , opinions have been done .
I accept all these processes as healthy information .
In every test all these three times have been tested .
Every part of the society has poisoned it .
There is an excellent process in delivery .
I am also telling blessings to all those who give climate , main food bakes .
On coming in the light of Lotu , Lopalu there is a chance of recovering them .
The thing is good , some good , bad , somebody learning the path from it , walk ahead with it in the evening .
Comprehensive examination strengthens the democracy .
For an unparalleled country , this treatment is necessary for a charming country .
This thing was written to me many families .
One person , one ordinary Pauru has increased this incident with my enthusiasm .
While sitting in such a big place I am observed to give such importance to the words in ' Manas ' while sitting at the big place , the princes of the president Greek , President Greek , Speaker Greek .
In one way a new cell has been given to the program of words in ' mind ' .
Some of our friends were also discussed with me while working on the book in this ' mind ' .
I am debted to Akbar .
Beloved people of my country , this time we keep on raining all the four corners of the country .
Come , we all walk ahead while loveing nature in this environment .
My generation is many blessed , thanksgiving .
Beloved people of my country , Namaskar .
Probably the habit of these problems , people have become habit of these problems .
Children 's carelessness , youths , elders etc things are coming in my sight .
If someone comes to cough while traveling in the bus , rail then immediately someone comes and gives some advice to do this .
It is giving advice , information that we are in our nature .
Many people try to give advice to reach me , many people do something in their life .
With the drinking of some good hand your intelligence , strength , capacity keep changing according to the situations .
Some people give advice to their advice at the place of working , the rest of them listen to them as a whole as a result of which they also give advice to everyone .
Not only this when I publish anything then it is very happy to remember such things .
After that many people have said that they have made some creative attempts to see the food of the country of Narendramodi Approximately four crore people of the country .
Some videos have also sent me .
There are roti banks at some places .
May is the establishment of one , Maharashtra , Gujarat state .
This contribution is many ruins of the people of these two states .
Both the states have made an effort to cross many new development peaks of the country .
In both the states the life of the great men is sufficient exercise , every kind of society of the society .
On the day of reminding these great men , on the day of the state freedom fighters i . . 2022 , we all our states , our country , all our society , our families , our families can be included .
To synthesis the plan should be made . walk ahead with the help of all the people .
On the second time these two states have many spectacles of me .
The rapidity of summer staying in the month of May , June in our country has to be felt this time in the month of April .
Therefore for talking to the mind this time I am consulting advice , maximum advices have been given advice to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also present in the proposal . Not only new but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that Balkani had kept water for the birds , Dabana , birds .
In many families small children also I have seen doing this work .
Once this work comes in the sight of them , if birds come ten times a day or if there is water in the bowl kept .
It gives us some sports but in reality it is a unique experience to bring the feeling of peace in the mind .
Although everybody knows about animal birds , natural life in our country but it is necessary to give strength to such efforts .
When I am the main minister of Gujarat then Danudi Bohra society of the society of the society came for hundred years .
They lived hundred three and three .
For the festivals of their hundred birthday Bohra society has run a very big garden to preserve the pinnacles by their Burani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
Approximately two thousand Bird Feders were sent to all the world .
This thing has also emerged in Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we become so unforgettable that people wearing pepper , milk , vegetables , Post Mann , in these summers somebody drinks good water in the gum .
Young friends , I want to talk to you also .
Sometimes in our youth many people like to spend life in contact John .
Mothers are also reproductive in a positive environment .
There are also different residents of this but most of the people living in contact John are seen .
Now the tests have been done , the methods to enjoy the cells .
The summer season remains good only after the summer season .
I want to tell how to tell your summers like a friend .
Some people definitely make useful , tell me that I am faithful .
If you want to go to unknown places , do not see , do not think .
Try new places , new experiences , new feelings .
I want to know why your interest is in these summer holidays .
Use new use .
The use should be positive . Keep you out of your contact zone .
We were of the comfortable families of the middle class .
What is the matter of those travellers , what do they go down at the station
In the evening go to the bush with your football , Waliball or some other sports .
If you play with those poor children , then see the joy of never enjoying life in that game .
If the children spending such life in the society get the chance of playing with you then how changes come in their life .
If you also go once then I can say with faith that I want to go again .
This experience teachs you a lot .
To reduce the technological distances , to reduce the borders , but its side effects changed so that six people living in one house are also in one room but it is also beautiful to imagine the distance between them .
Can you try to spend time with you away from technology
If we pay attention to the country full of many opinions then we get to learn something near us .
If you do not come to this , learn swimming , do not come to the best idol then try to give something to you .
Sometimes we feel the cost of small tasks that sometimes we can not learn some tasks .
You can learn the cost of walking but whenever you want to learn auto rickshaws .
You may have come to press the cycle , but sometimes try to walk the Trichakra vehicle while taking people .
You see , this new attempts , new experts not only give you happiness , but also your life standing in one condition can come out in it .
Keep in mind your friends .
I am telling my experience , we can not even imagine how much learning the world , how much it is possible to know .
New places , new cities , new cities , new villages , new places .
But if you are going anywhere before going , then try to see a gynaecologist like a gynaecologist , asking people , asking water , seeing those places is different .
Therefore you will get the opportunity to learn how much .
Mitra , this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity .
New waves get rid of the river nearby .
They do not need the river .
They began to believe digital consciousness .
Do you also believe , but do you ever think that you can get through this plan
Government of India has made a plan .
Are you going to load BHIM APP NOW DON.
Send it to each other .
If you do twenty people in a day then in the evening you will get two hundred rupees .
This plan is being implemented till 14th October .
In this way you will be helpful in making ' digital India ' .
New India becomes a copper .
And the holidays , and the sinners ,
Refresh - Organisation .
Normally there is a dry environment of virus culture in our country .
Now even if the red light went on cars , then the red light slipped in the brain could not be said very fast .
I am talking to Shiva Chaube from the main minister of Namaskar , Jabalpur of Madhya Pradesh .
I want to talk about the government's decision red bean light ban.
It seemed very proud to me .
Now my time was also very important .
I do not want to brick in the traffic jam . There is no alternative for each other .
For this decision I want to tell you thanksgiving thanks to my heart .
Through the decision of the government red light is a part of the arrangement .
In place of View . . in the country the importance of I . . is ' New India ' .
If IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMS
Every person has the importance , every person has importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crores of the country , if we accept all the importance of 125 crores of the country , then how big energy is done to realize the important dreams .
We should do this work together .
Beloved my country , we will always keep in mind our history , our culture , our traditional times .
Therefore we get strength , inspiration .
This year all our 125 crore people of our country celebrate thousands of people of Swami Ramayana .
Because of some reason we are not able to take so much , so little thinking that more than one century is thinking .
Think cosmetics .
Even if you want to come out of the society then how difficult is it .
How was that place before thousands
The queen of Ramayana had done very big fighting against the evil , description of the society , unconsciousness , species etc . during his time .
They have imagined all those who are unconscious by their self-confidence .
Before thousands he got permission to enter the house , to give them entry in the house .
To end the evil of the society of that time in every age it is our synonym to keep on running from our society .
Ramayanacharya is celebrating thousand Jayanti today , we are taking inspiration from him in the effort to make social unity of social unity .
The Government of India has released the memory of one Tarakhu Swami Ramayana dynasty to morrow .
I am telling the adventurous customs of Swami Ramayana .
Beloved people of my country , tomorrow is another speciality of Tarikh .
It is celebrated in many places in the world as a day of ' Shramiks ' .
When it came to pass on the day of Shramiks , when there was a church about Shramiks , it is natural to remember the guests of Babasaheb Ambedakar .
If I tell about Babasaheb Ambedakar , Swami Ramayana priests of Ramayana , the twelfth century of Karnataka , society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society .
In the twelfth century he had done deep thoughts on the subjects of hard works .
In Kannada Bash he said , Cave Kailash .
It means that you can get the cost of Shiva 's house with your industry .
That is , heaven is achieved by doing karma .
If you want to say in other words , Shrama Shiva .
It is natural to remember the Tangdi Garden while talking about meditations .
People of my favorite country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapuram .
All the followers of Buddha Lord Buddha celebrate festivals worldwide .
On the completion of Buddha on the completion of Wednesday it is my point of view to celebrate Vesak Day by the states .
This year it happens in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer Buddha Bhagwan in Sri Lanka .
There is a chance of reminding their memories .
My beloved country Prajalara , India always tried to move ahead with the mantra of ' Sab Ka Sath - Sabka Vikas ' .
In India ' Sabka Sath - Sabka Victoria ' is at times , which comes not only in India but also in the world heritage .
Especially our neighbouring countries also come to our countries .
You should have support with our neighbouring countries , development should happen to them .
Many uses are done .
May 5 India has been used in the south Asia museum .
This museum is very useful to fulfil the economic , economic , economic , economic , economic , economic , economic , economic .
Natural wildlife , television i . . electronic science i . . electronic science , technologists have helped this museum in the middle of people .
Beloved people of my country , sunshine is fast . protect them , save yourself .
Most of the family members of the country stay stuck in their children 's test .
In the families of those who have been tested the atmosphere of cosmetic environment , tests there is a lot of pressure in the family members .
At such a time I can say one thing , listen to what I told the students in the memory of Christ once .
In a historical war happening against unrighteousness Bangladesh has achieved victory over Bangladesh in a history war .
On such a day independent Bangladesh 's brother Pauruku , brothers , brothers in the Independence day , Bangladesh want to go forward in the progressive way .
Bangladesh is a strong , a good country , by making a hand with you , keeping peace in this Yavat area with you , to give complete support to India in the direction of development .
The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are the pride of giving partial heritage to our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the creation of our Guru Govindranath Tagore .
A interesting thing about Ravindranath Tagore is that in 1913 the best person who gave the book of Nobel Prize in 1913 , not only the Englishman gave him the title of ' Nighthood ' .
In 1919 when the British created Manhom in Jalianwala Bagh then Rabindranath Tagore is also one among the great men opposite to them .
This incident is the time of showing strong effect on the mind of a twelve children .
In the childhood while playing this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 if the twelveth century is lover of all of us , the Amarvir standing inspiration is Bhagt Singh .
Now three days Christ changed the 23th day of the month Bhagt Singh , he had climbed two friends Sukh Dev , Rajguru , English .
We all know that without the death of this incident Bhagt Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru three , without the death of India the happiness of the mother of India is left .
Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru are also kept in the story of the dedication of life .
Yavat British Empire was afraid of these three .
Although they were in jail , how they were concerned with them in light .
Therefore on changing the 24th month of March the training of 24th honey was done , March 23th honey was implemented .
Besides this their dead body was buried by bringing them to the Punjab region .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time there was a kind of impression in my body .
When the opportunity is available , then on going to Punjab , Bhagt Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , Rajguru , other statues of Batukeshwar Dattateshwar have been suggested to the youth of the country .
At that time it is called for freedom , its speed , its quantity is increasing .
On one side they started inspiring youths like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru .
The truth of Mahatma Gandhi had done the truth of the death of Mahatma Gandhi on the 10th April of 1917 .
This is the truth of Champaran truth centuries .
In the fighting of India Gandhi Waddam , Gandhi Garden style was known for the first time during the campaign .
Specially this incident is one miles in the entire journey of fighting for freedom fighting for freedom fighting .
During this time the magnificence of Champaran Satyagraha , Kheda Satyagraha , Ahmadabad 's mill carmits . in all these the opinions of Mahatma Gandhi Garden , behavior style of Talluku is seen strong .
In 1915 only two workings of a man returned to India .
The population of the population , Indian society , the power to know the society of the Indian society , with its own way the people of the British empire , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight , to fight .
If you know about Gandhi Garden during the time of Champaran truth that happened in one boy , then it is necessary to know how much the truth of the person starting normal life .
How to start normal life , how much industry , Gandhiji had done such a way from him .
All the big glimpse of listening to us like Rajendra Babu , Acharya Kripalani Garden were sent to Gandhi village at the same time .
In the working of people , how did it teach the color of freedom fighting .
A wonderful balance is in the working style of Gandhiji .
The wish of hundreds of old people to bring changes , attempts , attempts are the strong foundation of India , India .
There's a desire, a concept, a enthusiasm.
Beloved people of my country , we come out of our lives , seeing the works happening in the society with cosmetic society , seeing what happens around , if we try to understand , then the goal of the goal of the goal of the goal of the goal of the goals , the goal of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society .
It is also like a penance , like meditation , like a closed servant they do their work .
Everyday there are many people who serve patients by going to the hospital .
They are running along with blood donation .
Those who give food to food habits are somewhere .
Once it is seen in the form of social , incidents then it is known with such a big doubt .
All these are not celebrated with budget evening , government procedures , government money .
But you see the country sometimes . dream of hundreds of old crore people of the country ' New India ' seems to be synonymous before our eyes .
It is said that everybody should take care of the responsibility of Pauri religion .
Then the same New India starts a splendor .
On coming to India independence of 2022 Kalla India 75 years is remembered Bhagt Singh , Sukh Dev , Rajguru .
We fulfil the truth of Champaran .
Do we also participate in the journey from the kingdom to the kingdom of Suraj ' after regulating our life
In the last few months there is a month of such environment in our country , many big people have participated in the design of design , design .
After the rubbing of mouth many types of digital methods can be seen .
The beginning of Bhima Yap is only two and a half months , near one and a half crore people have loaded this Yap .
We have to move ahead to fight against the people of my country , black money , which are celebrated in water .
Can people of hundreds of old crore people of the country imagine that in this year two and a half thousand crores of digital Ladwa goddesses can celebrate .
We declared in the budget.
If this work done for the people of hundreds of old people of the country then they do not work for one year .
You can complete in six months .
We can do all these in daily life .
Because of this you can not imagine how much service of the country you can not imagine . black money , which can become a soldier in fighting against water .
In the last few days for making people aware of all these , many programs have been organised in the last few days .
In Yavad country such hundred programs have been contacted .
80-85 programs have been done .
The acquaintances made for businessmen were fifty thousand people .
Everybody has contacted this work forward .
First of all April 14 Dr . Baba Saheb Abedkar Jayanti dynasty ends this disorder fair .
On completion of hundred days a big program was celebrated .
The biggest drama is determined in it .
I believe that Dr . Babasaheb Ambedakar Jayanti is more time left with us , as much as possible Bhima Yap is published .
We polluted our part to reduce the movement of the river , not reducing behavior with mouth .
I am enjoying many kinds of advices when I asked advice every time in my favorite country residents , ' Manas ' .
But in the matter of cleanliness pills keep listening every time .
The girls reading the eleventh class sent a message by photographing from Deh Raa Dun . princes of the princes , chief minister Garu , your pride is my pride .
First of all you are many ruins to spend most of these so many times .
I want to talk to you in my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness .
I travel everyday on a river polluted by putting a lot of garbage .
Our house comes on the Rispna bridge of that river .
I recognize it properly .
I want to dream of anger in the minds of hundreds of old people .
Once anger starts , unsatisfaction starts , if we feel jealousy then we apply something to do the unconsciousness .
Approximately , active part is very important , whose importance is so much .
But cleanliness is always covered with a habit than ever .
I believe that in the country , in children , students , students , youths awakening in the youth this feeling is a good result .
We know that we have eaten in our house , in comparison to social food we also put food in our teaspoon .
After putting everything in the spoon it becomes difficult to eat .
In which half of them can not be put in the stomach , leaving there .
Do you ever think how much harm we are doing by leaving these holes
If you do not leave by sneezing like this , somebody can fill the stomach of the lice sometimes think .
It is not a matter of knowing it .
It is said that in our houses when small children eat as much as they eat .
But such a thing is good for family also .
They made some mobile yps .
In every state of our country such people will be seen at some places .
We should not leave our lives as much as we can eat , as much as we can eat , it gives sufficiency .
Look , change these paths are there .
Those who take precautions towards body , health they always tell that keep some empty stomach in the stomach , keep some empty in the glass .
Therefore April is the 7th day of the world health day .
Ayurveda University has been decided to be the goal of ' University Health Committee ' meaning ' everyone ' .
This time the 7th April of the ICDS has been paid attention to the depression of the world health day .
According to one estimate people above 35 crores of people are suffering from mental depression .
The danger is that in those around us also we like to talk about this thing as well .
The person suffering from depression also does not talk about it because that person also becomes ashamed to discuss about it .
I want to tell the people of the country that there is no relief from depression .
On making a mental environment one starts getting rid of it .
First mantra is that instead of suppression x - ray is necessary .
Tell your friends , parents , parents , parents , students to tell you what is your mind .
Sometimes children living in the guest house are so difficult because of loneliness .
The beauty of our country is that we are mixed in big families of the elderly families of the elderly families therefore there is no shape of depression .
You believe they're the first step towards depression.
This is the best alternative .
This depression occurs because of physical , mental diseases .
As diabetes is the root of all kinds of diseases , as well , depression is also not standing , not taking adventurous , not taking adventurous decision , all the ability to take decisions .
There is also another method .
On meeting others , when someone has served , you can easily make the weight of your mind easy .
June 21th day is the third international yoga day .
Some lakhs of people in comparison to social yoga daily give you even today .
If there is any advice about this third international yoga day in your mind , then send your advice to me through your mobile option , suggest ways .
How many pasts , poetic creations related to yoga can you make it easy for people .
How much church has come about health therefore I told that mothers , brothers also have told me this time .
In the last few days the Government of India has taken a big decision .
The number of industries situated in our country is increasing everyday in the category of working their participation has to be welcomed .
Along with this there are special responsibilities for women .
Apart from the responsibilities of family they also have to participate in economic responsibilities because of which sometimes or even then the children born .
That is why the Government of India has taken a big decision .
This work is that women who are all those who are pregnant , during pregnancy , at the time of pregnancy , at the time of pregnancy 12 weeks of pregnancy have now increased for 26 weeks .
In this matter two three countries of the world are before us .
Technology has become a part of diversity in our life .
Flowers develop .
Gardens , forests are filled with greenery .
The climate of birds touches the mind .
Besides flowers teeth are also seen shining in the sun from the branches of trees .
In summers mango fruits coming properly start appearing in the spring of mango .
Yellow mustard flowers in fields increase the estimation of rails .
The flowers of red pearls give the message of Holi .
The poet Amir Khus Road has described how much more on these moments changing the weather .
He said such : The flowers of mustard , as if they were cut off from the gardens , as if they were cut off .
When the nature is happy , when the environment is pleasant then man also enjoys that environment .
Festivals like Panchami , Maha Shivaratri , Holi etc . fill the colors of joy in the life of man .
In the environment full of love , superstition , humanity we are telling the ' Falguna ' of our last month . New month is ready to welcome ' Chaitra ' .
This two months is the season of the season of Kadapa .
In Shobha Jalan i . . Narendramodi Ape , many people do not want to use the use of AIDS therefore you want to give some information about the use of 104 museums .
Blessed is your blessedness to remember the example of the pride of India .
If you want to discover poverty , then you want to get rid of diseases , knowledge , knowledge , information , technology , science they have achieved the place which is possible through science .
2017 February 15th February is a glorious day in the life of Indians .
Our country has done such an important work to lift up the head with the pride of the world .
In the last some time they completed many unparalleled uses in AIDS -LRB- Isro -RRB- successfully .
After the successful uses of ' Mars machine ' , ' Mangalya ' etc . in the space of the world record in the space of space for some days .
Once the history created by sending 104 museums in space has remained India as the first country .
It is a matter of enjoying the use of 38th successfully .
This is not only ' Isro ' but also a historical special work of India .
This space program running with less expensive expensive expensive expensive expensive expensive expensive expensive expensively changed into a unique world .
The scientists of India have displayed this victory with the heart of the whole world .
Brother Manulara , these 104 museums are main in India 's museum cartosat 2 .
How beneficial are the pictures taken from this calculation , wildlife meditation , museums , economic estimations , urban development plans etc .
Especially my brethren should use the corner of water in the country where the corner of my brethren is , how should it be used , what is the main things to keep in mind , then cartosat 2 is helpful for us .
While going to our cataract some pictures have been sent .
It started its work only .
It is a matter of enjoyment that all this program has been done by our youth scientists , women scientists .
This strong partner of youth , women , women is a pride in the victory of the victory of Isro .
I am telling the scientists of Isro scientists of all the people of the country .
For people , for the services of the country , for the use of space science everyday new records are also included .
Our scientists , their entire bundle we told how many acquaintances are less .
Shobha George has also been given another question related to Bhadrata of India .
In this matter India has also proved the second important success of India .
There is no big church about this thing but it has been seen on this main thing .
In the protection also India Balistic interference centres have been tested successfully .
Interceptive technology their tuberculosis has recognized the tuberculosis of enemies from a height of 100 kilometres near the earth , Kuppukulchi Vijay .
Our Indian scientists have seen this .
Moreover its energy is such that if there is any tuberculosis to attack India from a distance of 2000 kms , then the power to destroy it in space is under our tuberculosis .
On seeing new technology , we enjoy some new victory of science .
In the journey of human life Taluku developed jewellery has played a very important role .
Special knowledge , everybody does not let their jewellery be like a jewellery .
That is why gynaecology becomes the cause of new research .
Nobody gets peace from their questions .
If we discover the journey of human life Taluku for thousands of years , then we can tell anything that this human life is not so much for the journey of Talluku development .
The same is impossible .
Everything , creation rules , human mind keeps trying continuously to know the mind .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
It is said that when we talk about my favorite youth , science , scientists , scientists , scientists , scientists , scientists , scientists have said that many times in our youth science has increased the attraction of science in our youth .
Many scientists of the country are important .
Today scientists become the cause of a permanent change in the lifestyle of the coming generation .
Mahatma Gandhi's words are no science droped from the sky in a perfect form.
The science should always take care of the needs of ordinary people , how can it be used naturally , what method is useful for them , because it is the most beneficial for the common man .
To identify such creatives , to exhibit their information , to give them information , how to produce such creative activities to people , how to produce them at a height , how to use them , how much important work they have done .
I saw a discovery of this .
In 2005 maximum rains came in Mumbai .
It means that in the society , in the society , in the country , this kind of role is very good .
Our society also becomes very sensitive in the direction of technology .
All the arrangements are also walking in the direction of technology .
In one way technology has become a different part of our life .
In the last few days design is very strong .
Gradually people leaving the river move towards digital consciousness .
Digital Ladwa Devi is also growing very fast in India .
Especially youngsters are habitual to celebrate their digital phones from their mobile phones .
I think this is a clean signal .
Some days Christ has received heavy massage for ' Laki Grahk John ' , ' DG - trade John ' in our country .
Through these two methods an attempt has been made to convert the rivers of India into a proposal .
In this plan more than 100 Khatadars have got a gift according to one lakh rupees .
More than four thousand traders got priority according to fifty thousand traders .
Or if I ask this poisonous description of old age also then I am also enjoying to know that besides fifteen years of age besides fifteen years of age .
It is said that Sri Anand George from Mysore has received a thousand rupees in Lakki Grah Yoga .
And I found a thousand rupees , and the poor elders of that poor , and gave her a thousand rupees .
Every journey keeps telling about digital related things .
How enthusiasm things are encouraged , others also encouraging .
The worshipping of Maharashtra is also done in the form of a young friend , card , i . . . in his family how much enjoyment is being done in his family , how much enjoyment is done with his friends .
It is said that how much priceless to come to lakhs of rupees , he has also encouraged it by taking it a garden , others also .
In my sight , everybody related to this work is a new opposite team of this country .
One way you're clean soldiers.
April is a dragon of 14 crores of rupees .
There are 40,45 days near it .
Can you do some work keeping in mind Baba Saheb Ambedakar
Some days Christmas Baba Saheb Ambedakar had taken 125th Jayanti .
Remember them you also learn to load at least 125 BHIM APP Down .
This time give special importance to Baba Saheb Ambedakar Jayanti , BHIM APP , both .
Therefore I told that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb .
Going home , connecting everyone with 125 crores of hands include BHIM APP .
The effect of this park running for the last two-three months is that how successful in many villages , many villages , many cities .
Beloved my country residents , our country 's economy is a big pillar of agriculture .
The economy of the villages strengthens the economic disease of the country .
Now I want to tell you something fun .
Our brothers , brothers and sisters filled our cereals .
This seventh year in our country cereals have been produced in the record level with rail work .
Our rails have told all the old records that all the signals have been told .
This time fruits have been planted in the fields , it seems as if the festivals of Pangal , Baisakhi are celebrated everyday .
This year about two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country .
This time more than the Namoda Akhri record named our rails is 8  more emotional .
This is so much successful .
I am specially impressing the rails of the country .
Because they kept in mind the poor people apart from traditional fruits , various kinds of pulses have been cooked because the poor gives most proteins only with pulses .
Keeping in mind the need of rails in the country two hundred ninety lakh hectares of land has enjoyed me very much fun .
This is not only the product of various kinds of pulses , but also the great service of the poor people of my country .
My prayer , all my hearing , how the rails of my country have produced the record of pulses by lifting up my eyes . Therefore my brothers and sisters were specially adventurous .
Beloved people of my country , the government of our country , through the society , institutions , everybody is doing some work in the direction of cleanliness .
In one way everyone seems to be behaving in a form related to cleanliness in some form .
Government is also constantly trying .
Six houses made toil pits empty , they were healed .
Twin Pitt toilets have been opened , then the rulers have seen the methods of using these toilets again .
How do we clean other cleans , this toilet can also be cleaned as well .
Because it is natural to attract the attention of the people of the country when a ruler of AIDS cleanses their own toilets .
It is also proved .
Six members are filled in five storeys of the family of the family .
After that the garbage can be changed easily into another pit .
In six to twelve months the sword reaching the toilet goes completely .
The way the government takes this precaution , other people also use such beforehand .
In the government also clean bird festivals are continuously happening in different parts .
In the first bird of March , with the ' mother and child welfare minister Shakh ' they are also going to give massage to this clean program .
We welcomed the exhibition of our Divya players in Rio Parlimpics .
This glorious activity of Divya friends is pride .
Often one has to learn from them something or the other .
What is the matter related to play , space related to space women of our country do not take anybody .
While putting steps they are moving ahead . increasing the country with their victory .
In the ' Asia Ragbi Senses Trophy ' happening between this the women players of our country were conducted .
All of them are my heartbeats .
March 8th honey is also celebrated throughout the world on the day of women .
Increase the mirror towards them . Beti Bachao - Beti Padao ' has moved fast .
This is not only a government program .
A social meditation , January has become a program .
In the last two decades this program attracts the heart of the common people .
This problem of all the four sides of the country has thought that people have changed their thinking about the behavior of the people coming from generation to generation .
As soon as the child is born , how much joy comes to know about the architects .
In a way the growth of girls is because of their social support .
Tamilnadu state can stop child marriages through a special program in Kadalur district of Tamilnadu state .
Till now about 175 girls can stop marriages .
The district administration department has opened the banks of girls on 55-60 thousand near the part of the district administration .
In the districts of Jammu Kashmir along with the construction of the districts along with the construction of the districts along with the construction of the district administration of the districts along with the construction of the district administration of the district administration of the district administration of the district administration of the district administration of the district administration of the district administration of the district administration of education of educations etc .
In order to read girls in Madhya Pradesh the program to go to the village , home is being done by the name of ' Har Ghar Dastak ' .
In Rajasthan the program of ' Apna Bacha ' , Apna Vidyadhar ' program was organised , the girls who returned to the school , encouraged them to read them again .
It is said that ' Beti Bachao - Beti Padao ' has also been converted into many forms .
This park has become a whole of a province .
New thoughts are kissed with it .
It is changing according to the needs of the province .
I got the opportunity to speak something or the other with you sometimes through the program of words in my country residents .
You are also active .
How do I know from you .
What happens , in villages , poor people are coming in mind .
I am  debted to you for this support .
Manki Bath , August 2019 .
Today our country is enjoying rains on one side .
On the other hand on the corner of Hindustan some festival , fair Deepavali is celebrated .
Probably our ancestors , in any situation the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society .
Till this time we celebrated many festivals .
The birthplace of Shri Krishna festival has been done in the same Hindustan .
It is such a person who spends thousands of years , even if every festival takes a new opportunity , then somebody thinks that it is taking new energy .
Today if I talk to you then thinking about two important monasteries .
One of the Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohammad , one of the other , Charkhadhari Mohan .
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohammad left the seashore of Yamuna , and went to the seashore of Gujarat , and dwelt in the city of Dwarkah , and came to the shore of the sea shore , and spent the last hours of life in Delhi .
Sudarshan Chakradhara Mohantain had completely used his intelligence , his intelligence , his capacity to stop war , to stop war , to stop war .
At this very same time India is in the arrangement of another big festival .
This church is done not only in India but also in the whole world .
I am talking about Mahatma Gandhi's 150 gambling.
He was served to the trains becoming victims of safety in the Champaranya .
To remove many misconceptions related to blood pressure they have themselves served the patients of blood pressure .
Through the service itself stands as an example of his life .
We can understand this thing directly from the life of Bapuji .
Mahatma Gandhi was mainly the person , society , humans , humans .
Finiks Farm of African , Talstoy Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardha , all places , in a special way the society of society , committee Mobelization was capable of them .
It is necessary to bring all these feelings of society , society , society community community community community community communications in our business life .
If you want to tell the truth then this is the reality of Mahatma Gandhi , true work .
We were contacted with people in the society , connected with all the classes , together with all the ages , the village city is a woman , or the society associated with everyone , I can try to do something as a person .
The cost of the cost of my generation is good .
Community is our strength .
In the programs happening in this 150 January year there is also no social , service .
Our woman is Mandali Ladys Club .
We did the work of Ladies club in modern times , but together with the challenge of Ladies club everyone would mix some service program .
We can do too much.
To divide the books , to divide the poor , to know such 130 crores of Indians , 130 crores of Indians can start 130 crores .
There is no harm in the mind - if you are able to take good adventurous , good adventurous , absolutely absolutely absolutely unconscious .
That too peaceful happiness - if it is for a unique joy .
My beloved country , I went to Daan of Gujarat for a few months .
In the fight of freedom fight the ' s salt truth ' is a very important monastery .
I participate in the beginning of a modern museum given to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi .
Through this others also write three four things while expressing your feelings along with those photographs .
During coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been organised .
But in this context I want to participate with you a interesting thing .
Venice Binenale is a famous art exhibition where the artists of the world are included .
This time an interesting exhibition was organized with Gandhi's memories in the Indian building of Venice Biennale.
In this Haripura Panels are specially interesting .
The incident of Kangras in Haripura of Gujarat , in which the history of Subhas Chandrabos student is remembered to you .
This is a beautiful past of Art Panel.
Before the Haripura council of Kangras in 1937 - 38 Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan art Bhawan was invited to Princepal Nandal Boss .
Gandhiji had displayed the exhibition of his Art Wildlife Sanctuary in this council .
Art work which shows our state is this Nandal Boss .
There is a special identity of the state .
This Boss has administered itself along with the artistic state .
The villages nearby Nandal Bos Haripura , in the end the rural life of India has been prepared by showing the life of India .
There was a great church in Venice about this priceless art process.
I want some contact with the symbol Hindustan along with the 150 birth anniversary of Gandhiji .
Do something for the country , society , others .
The same is the straight , real genetic activity of Bapu .
This time it starts from 11 September .
During this time we came out of our houses and offered the work of Mahatma Gandhi with hard work .
But houses , streets , streets , but streets , but art gallery but cleanliness should be organised in all the public places .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
I told how hundred crores of people of the country while talking to Agricultural Fort , how encouraged the enthusiasm , energy , how did I work to get rid of excretion from excretion in Bahrang areas .
We're all together to stop Single Use Plastic's man.
In this procedure all the classes of the society are enthusiasm .
Through this money remains , in environmental protection the role of its part is fulfilled .
This time apart from dedicated to India released from the excretion of Bahrang Museum in the context of celebrating 250 jewellery of October Babaji , not only did the foundation of plastic opposite opposite opposite opposite .
I am making a jewellery with all the classes of the society , every village , every city residents .
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated to free India from plastic tree .
All the Municipality , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , private organizations , all the organizations , everybody 's information that plastic plantation should be done properly .
If this plastic test is done at one place then how should it be left properly then how to display the arrangement of displaying diamonds I am publishing all the corporate sectors .
It can be recycled .
It can be used in fuel .
Today I want to tell a very important thing with a culture .
Food is very important in our culture .
As much as we were also included in science .
In ' Nutrition Abhyan ' the nutrition of modern scientific methods of the country is becoming popular .
People fight with malnutrition in new interesting methods .
Once a thing came in my eyes .
In Nasik a big garden named corn filled with pink .
In which in the days of fruits anganwari services of anganwari are conserved cereals from people .
This corn is used to make hot food for women , children .
In this the person donating donation becomes a member of the society .
This shape is celebrated for the first time while feeding the children .
Drink is not food but honey food .
Gujarat has done a thought in 2010 . Why should not it be necessary to give complementary food to children by giving complementary food to children
This is very important , it can be participated everybody .
People in many states eat food .
Service , joyfulness is a unique view .
Scientists . By many such small methods our country can take the effect of fighting with malnutrition .
Today proper information , poor people , snakes are also becoming a victim of malnutrition .
The whole country is celebrated in the form of ' malnutrition development ' in the month of September .
This time when I think about ' Manki Baat ' then it seems as if there are many questions about this thing .
In the last few weeks I went where I met my people about ' Man Wes Wild' .
I did not imagine that the chance of establishing the youth hearts of the world come in my life .
But what happened .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
When I came to the main minister George then I am asking about some thing that international yoga Divas talked with someone in the world about yoga for five minutes .
Those who do not discuss yoga with me in the big ground of the world . I am telling about this thing about the whole world .
Discovery channel has planned this program in 165 countries in their language .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate , clean environment in our country .
But another interesting thing is that some people are talking to me , Modi , say that you are talking to Hindi , Bir Grals do not Hindi .
After this do the cost of adventure .
Then what has been done to shoot again .
It is questioned very difficult .
Look , there is no secret in it .
Many people have this question in mind . Okay , I tell this secret now .
Actually this is not secret .
Actually technology has been fully used in the conference happening with Bear Grals .
As soon as I told anything that it was done in English , because of being parallel to it a small card lens has been kept in the ears .
Therefore if I talk in Hindi then because of listening to him in English the discussion of technology is successful .
After this show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to the places of nature , wild animals , living places .
What is nature
You will stay watching .
Your internal also becomes big .
On 15 August I heard you on the Red Fort . at least 15 places in the three three places of India , 15 places of India become completely tourist center .
You go, see, study, take family, spend some time there.
Your thought is very big .
Children of my favorite country , environment safety , care i . . conservation of conservation is seen naturally .
In the last month I have been able to release the population of tigers in the country .
You know how many tigers in India .
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred sixty and seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the corners .
In 2010 a tiger was conducted in St . Peters Burg of Russia .
In it information about reducing the number of tigers , taking a contact .
The number of tigers in the world of 2022 is doubled .
But this is now new India . We fulfill the goals quickly .
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 .
Not only tigers in India but also the number of wildlife reserves , community reserves has increased .
While releasing the tigers I also recognized the lions of Gujarat .
When I responsibilities there I kept reducing the residence of lions in the jungles .
Their number was decreasing .
We took many churches together in Gir.
In 2007 the decision of making women gardens there .
To increase the tourists we gradually gradually gradually .
When we talk about natural , wild animals then the preservation of preservation is done .
But along with protection you should think about taking this church towards Karna .
Therefore it is not necessary to save forests , trees , wild animals , but they should also give proper environment to increase in proper way .
How can my beloved country residents , how can we forget the historical science of Swami Vivekananda in 1893 .
You will remember that my favorite country residents , 29 August is celebrated as a national festival .
In this context we start ' Fit India Movement ' throughout our country .
Keep yourself fit and make the country fit .
All their descriptions are now told .
Watch 29 August .
The entire plastic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic .
To get rid of plastic we should keep all the houses , houses together with mind at all places .
I know about this thing that in Soshil media .
Come , let us move ahead with a new alternative , new energy .
I'm waiting for your suggestions, for your words.
Come , let us all come forward to the dreams of freedom fighting India , Gandhi dreams of India , Gandhi dreams .
Manki Bath - speaks in mind .
O my favorite country , Namaskar .
On 26 January 26th day we celebrated all the country with enthusiasm .
The authority of the country , the authority of the country , the authority of the people of the country , democracy of the country , all these are like a festival of our country . This is the responsibility of the preservation of the preservation of the preservation of the preservation .
But now the responsibility of people in our country , how deep , how deep , how deep is it not happening .
To morrow 30 January our worshipped Bapuji is the pilgrimage .
On 30 January 30 in the morning two minutes silently , we pay tribute to the martyrs sacrificed for the country .
This natural way is necessary in the society , country .
In any two minutes there is also support of balance , contact , martyrs .
In our country a natural surprising surprising surprising strength is pronounced .
I am impossible for all his family members who were honored with various books in the morning .
In these books there are many types of services like Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , Param Vishwit Service , Vishwit Service etc .
If we understand their virtue , adventurous activities properly then we also get inspiration from pride besides pride .
On 26 January 26th January while staying with honour , enthusiasm on one side we were standing in the security of our army soldiers in Kashmir .
I am publishing all these virgins in Adarpuram .
My youth , everyone knows well , I keep talking in my mind continuously .
All the months of January , February , March , April are tested in every family .
There are two children in the house , that test is done on everyone at home .
This is the right time to speak to their students , their students , their teachers , because I went somewhere , whom I got this test very big problem .
The family , students , students are seen mixing everybody . a big unique mental environment is seen in every house .
Seeing them I want to pay attention to the thought that came in my mind .
I got a telephone message from creation.
Listen , what is the creation , what I want to tell you , during tests , in our house , in our society a fearful environment is monthd .
Due to this the students become unsuccessful inspiration .
Those who want to be enjoyed are beneficial .
Therefore my goal is to consider a festival like a festival . tests .
On the occasion of festival , festival the best enthusiasm in us comes out .
Our society also expresses during the festival .
What is the best .
Festival removes the test of environment .
Therefore I told all the parents that you change all these three-four months in the time of enthusiasm .
Actually , from Kanyakumari to Kashmir , Varuku form of Kach , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh tests for these three-four months .
That's why I call 'smile moore, score moore' with all of you.
If you are inspired then all the doors are closed . the matter does not come inside , it does not come out .
You do not even say anything .
It is inside that why came to remember that you came out of sword .
Therefore , the important medicine to increase memory is that which is relaxed .
Through my self-confidence I say that if we are stressed then we forget our things , but when relaxation is done then how many things do we remember .
That's why 'A Happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet' is the main thing.
Sometimes it is said that we can not see proper tests .
It is not a life test .
How do you live , how do you want to live , how does not test everything .
Apart from tests given by mouth book in clas room many more tests have been faced in your life , therefore keep on coming out with the guides of life .
J.
Abdul Kalan is an important example of all our eyes .
He wanted to reach the airways .
Not found .
Somebody has sent a question to me . During this time I see the biggest challenges that electricity has become the center of test .
That is why I want to know your thoughts about the future of education , its future .
It is said that in their question there is a pocket but Rurcha Garhwal has also been able to know my opinion .
Tell yourself , do you have a family doctor to show so much of your family .
You see his experience , knowledge , how much he uses .
The ' Rucha Garhwal ' has also been described as ' President ' .
This is a big mental war .
The speciality of the life of many good players is that they competition with themselves .

Whether it does not happen to everyone but it is my experience .

Your concentration increases .
Freshness increases in you .
The capacity of your entire capacity increases properly .

The species of heat about the heat of the sun are so natural .
Other than this , due to the presence of ill effects in the last two years , the effect of every kind of water has been seen on the places standing .

I know that in some days tests start happening .
Everybody asks how to get ready to tests .
How many times come , how much scorpion I want to say something .
You should decide your goal for yourself .
While playing cricket I kept many estimations on me , how much would I expect from me .
Some estimations of time have been named even more .
Then how important is it necessary for me to find out some solution .

I am constantly trying to conduct those goals .
My sight has been fulfilled slowly on the ball .
Good luck.
You should make your future .
I believe that these things of Sachin Garden are definitely useful for you .
Why should we not keep our spectacle with us
Where we reached , how far we came .
Do not stick in the number of such numbers .
Make a goal of more than one important goal of life . journey with a dream .
Therefore if a huge , high dream is chosen then tests become a joyous festival .
In them healthy mind remains in the body of healthy body .
If this thing is done 365 days our church should be according to our dreams , and cultural meditation .
The information done specially is that you should sleep regularly , we should wake up early in the morning , we should get up from sleep .
Reach the entry of the test centres , other things before the appointed time .
Do not do this .
I believe you do this .
Otherwise , in order to keep the foundation of victory in life the root causes to keep the foundation of victory .
There is a strong foundation from regular symptoms .
They do not feel well , they do the work of working in the morning in the evening , how long time they do the work of running in the afternoon .
Not only this , our daily routine also becomes unsuccessful .
Therefore we should not see everything small .

I am ready to test my tests , what is my experience now .
It has been seen that these tests like problems occurring before life .
Therefore if you are calm , eating nutritious food , sleeping properly then your brain can remember proper peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute , see a very important store , even more important for you , see the store of your good memory again .
Vishwanathan enjoyed really important thing .
How much he sits in the international church competitions , how much concentration you will be able to discover .

If the question is not understood then sometimes the question seems difficult .
Therefore tests of competition .
Do not worry , do your energy without bending .
I told all my young friends .
At the same time , keep in mind one thing - there are many chances of this country .
Decid whatever you want to do in life , do not take it forever .
You run .
You do not forget about this world maternal children .
Trees - you also have the right to stay here as if you are marble of mountains .
You have to take care of it , unconscious feeling , meditation .
With these symptoms you will be excellent in all the tests .
You want to do victory in every matter .

Manki Baat , June 2019 .
O my beloved countrymen , worshippers .
Sometimes we inspire ourselves .
How can you imagine how I spend time in the middle .
On Sunday , last Sunday I felt as if I had lost something at 11 o'clock .
It seems sure .
Probably this is not a permanent program .
It seemed as if life was living in this program , mind was luxurious , heart was luxurious , hence this program was very difficult for me .
But this Sudai had waited very much .
It is said that in the last few months many messages came . people also say that ' Manki Baat ' is being displayed .
I am very good when I read them , when I hear them .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in so many acquaintances that many people were questioned that it was your hiccup .
You can do your curiosity .
I also want to divide those feelings with you .
But if they talk then the form of ' Manki Baat ' changes .
In how many acquaintances , in the contribution of Jaypjayal , even more polio I am Baaldera .
Many people were discovered in it .
It's my turn, I'm the chance to spend with me.
Everything is now said that in the valleys of Kedar the light made in my mind because of the small breakfast coming in the ' Manki Baat ' .
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
I can not say that when I do . but definitely do .
Because you have that right on me .
In the matter of Kedar how people have seen hypnotise some positive things , I have spent many times in your words .
Sometimes my thoughts also keep on talking to you .
People , the problems related to the country , society , social problems , challenges are also being brought in my sight .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , then attempts to express their wrath towards pollution are also exhibited for cleanliness .
That is , how the results of problems are seen in your words in the society of society .
The country of ' Manki Bath' is like a fare of the society's anger.
It is known by this that there is no lack of strength , strength , talent situated in the country .
It is necessary to give a chance to fulfil those strengths , talents by giving a chance , it is necessary to do the work .
It is another matter that in the development of the country 130 crore people are participating actively , successfully .
When I am analyzing such things , how much joy comes in my mind then you can imagine how much energy is available .
Actually I did not come , you brought me , sitting . You gave me the opportunity to speak again .
With this feeling we moved ahead the tradition of ' Manman Ki Baat ' .
There was an acquaintance in everyone 's mind .
Therefore the country has given so many acquaintances for the protection of democracy apart from its own self-confidence .
Probably in any country of the world people there have not only put Ooty for the democracy of their rest , authority , authority , necessity , not only for the democracy of this country .
Today how many so many acquaintances of Praswamy , very big so many acquaintances have been done in our country today everybody has been able to decide the future of our country with happiness in this festival .
When we have something, we'll underestimate it, we'll also ignore its admiring facts.
This number can seem to us something ordinary but if we leave one China in the world , then more people of any country of the rest of the world have been discovered today .
But how many people were put in the number of civilizations in 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America , almost double .
The total number of Ooty in India is more than the population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness of our democracy.
The number of civilizations in 2019 is now the biggest preservation of the world in history .
In such a situation you can imagine how big level human power , arrangements are needed .
It is possible if lakhs of students , rulers , workers work day and night .
To fulfil this greatness of Praswamy about three lakh Paramilitary teams have been responsible for their responsibilities , 20 lakh police workers of various states have also been distressed in the pride .
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting has been done more than this time .
On the whole of the country 10 lakh police stations , approximately 40 lakhs of E . . -LRB- E . . . -RRB- machines , 17 lakhs -LRB- VVPAT -RRB- , how big arrangements can you imagine .
It has also been done that no opportunity has come to use its Ooty .
A police station has been built for only one woman Ooty in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh .
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place of the world is in India .
This is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul - Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh .
Not only this , there is more chance of pride in this so many so many acquaintances .
Probably for the first time in history women also participate in Ooting as enthusiasm as compared to men .
The quantity of women , men , men is approximately equal .
Although enthusiasm is really that today 78 -LRB- 78 percent -RRB- women are employees in parlor .
My beloved countrymen , I say that ' Book ' is not ' Book ' , you have heard many times .
In welcome - welcome we pray to give books instead of flowers .
Such books are being given at many places .
In the midst of this the book of ' Premchand ' has been given the book of ' Premchand ' .
It was good for me .
If you do not get long time , I got the opportunity to read many stories again .
In their stories the entertainment of the whole of India reflects .
While reading the story of ' Shasha ' which he had married my sight towards the economy of the society .
When I was young then I remembered how many nights spent in the churches .
It is said that if the son of Jamindar is not aware of this story of this story of Ishwari , poor family then it is known that when the effect of badness occurs .
The second story of my heart is ' Idgah ' , a child ' s heart ' s heart , he loved his mother ' s heart , and loved him in his young age .
It is said that taking 4 . years from Hamid contact with my mother , really human heartbeat is considered to be the pride of human heartbeat .
The last pancreas of this story does not feel so much , small Hamid parlor plays the old Hamid parlor - old Amina , Amina has become small sin .
In the same way ' Puskey Rat ' is a miraculous story .
In this story a painting of painful life is seen .
It is happy that if its fruit has been destroyed then it is not necessary to sleep as if it is not necessary to sleep at night in the winters shivering .
Actually these stories are old for a century , today it seems appropriate to contact .
After reading these I felt a special experience .

If this library is in a village of dense forests -LRB- Idukki -RRB- then you will not be surprised .

Manki Batt , November 2018 .
On the third day of 2014 October , Vijayashmi Festival started the Manki Bath program . This ' Manki Bath ' started a journey connected with us .
We - this Manki Bath Dharawahi journey completes fifty bags with these .
That is why this is our golden Jubuli Episod i . . this is the golden year of Manki Bath .
This time the phones coming from all of you have also been published the contribution of this golden festival .
Anshu Kumar , Amar Kumar , Patna , Vikas Yadav of Delhi .
It is said that all the weeks , people say that you are more technological technology , social media media media , mobile ypnotise .
But why did you choose radio to meet people
Tell me a story.
This was in 1998 .
I am a member of the Indian population party while working in Himachal Pradesh .
The cost of ' India ' is known as ' Bombay ' .
I do not understand .
Then said Anna , Behold , as soon as radio listen to the radio , the same thing has been discussed in radio .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee George came forward , told that on that day the atmosphere test has been done . This procedure has been done in radio .
I was estimated the power of radio .
After giving me prime minister it is natural to return my attention towards the most powerful medium .
Fed Back coming in this survey is very interesting .
How much expansive discussion has also been done about the puja .
This is the best example of social , positive feelings in all our country 's minds .
Because of the program of Manki Bath some people have also divided their experiences as well .
People are coming forward to the big height for the society . This changes .
I am very happy to change radio more favorite to the people because of the Manki Bath program .
The northern , online expansions , phones , phones , all these are clearly visible .
Modi comes , goes , but this country remains stable . our culture remains long .
All these small stories of 130 crores of country are alive forever .
All these give new inspiration to this country , with new enthusiasm the highest peaks of this country .
My experiences also participate with water with your everyone .
After that slowly this thing moves towards a change while buying houses , social meditation , Watspep .
Teaching all the houses standing at all , sometimes the prime minister of phones also give that country to the prime minister in phones .
The cost of the small village of Haryana , not only in the country but also in the country and abroad the power to participate for any government can come forever .
Many times Manki Baat is also a victim of laughter but in my mind all the people of 130 crore people of the country are always there .
All of them are my heart .
Manki Bath is not the word of the government , it is the word of the society .
Manki Bath is a sympathetic India, a reliable India's word.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glorious glorious gloriousness of the eleventh mankind is that besides a prime minister you are asking a nearby man i . . Praswamy meaning this is the same .
If you want to say easy peace then there is nothing to make your question .
I am very easy work .
Every time people come in front of Manki Batt .
People participate their thoughts in May , Nrandra Modi Mobile Yap . One tol French November is also 180017800 .
People who photographed this November record their message with their throat .
Before the beginning of Manki Baat I try to read more north , more expansions themselves .
I hear many phone calls myself .
Do not fall near the Manki Bath program , in the time of traveling I read how silently .
Every moment all the people of my country stay in my mind therefore anybody reading north , their feelings become part of my thoughts .
This north is not just the piece of crown .
Actually I mouth the name of the village , person etc .
I am blessed everybody participating in Manki Baat , examples , emotional , excitement , excitement of my country .
Without reading their north , expansions the number of those who send Uttaranchal , Vishakhapattanam is in lakhs .
There is also an attempt to bring unparalleled Uttaranchal , information related to information . I am the sky , Afghan .
Blessed is also telling all my partners in radio , far away , rest of T . . Chhanals , social meditation .
Because of their hard work Manki Baat reaches most people .
The program of every Manki Bath program of the sky is being published in many languages .
Some people are also listening to the voice of Manki Baat with the same heaven nearby Modi throat in the province language .
Similarly they become the model of Nrandra Modi for thirty minutes .
You all want to listen to the program of Manki Bath in your language .
It is believed that everybody has done less conservation about themselves , or the archaeological exhibition about the archaeological exhibition happening about the water .
But many things proposed in Manki Baat have changed media in their own things .
In many things like cleanliness , road safety , drugs free India , self-confidence , drugs , drugs etc have done the work of moving forward in a new way .
If you do not support then my journey of this Manki Bath was incomplete .
Thanks to many things for your phone call .
If you want to tell the truth then there is no secret near me .
Our old things of our own life do not stop us , it is easy to understand anybody in front of us .
Sometimes our bird sanctuary gives the biggest sports to the conference .
It is my first priority to understand anything instead of confessing , not confessing , instead of every activity .
I am trying to speak with various programs or social meditation .
I keep trying to understand that they do , think .
The youths questioned that it was very good .
Water reservoirs in multi-tasking .
If we pay attention to the surroundings of us , social Entrepreneurship Aina , Stops , sports , or any other kind of changes in the society .
By making a question , doing adventurous adventurous adventurous games .
If we bring youth thoughts on the ground , give them freedom to express them then they can bring changes in the country . They are also doing this .
I want to talk about the kingdom coming on 26 November i . . on 26 November i . . on 26 November i . . on 26 November .
It is said that today very special , because we are asking the state today in the year of 25th century .
Blessed are many blessed for your information .
All these Mahamahals have given us such an expansive , expansive state .
With an extraordinary speed the shore built by the Veerta State is also an example of Tim management cool , producing .
It also inspires us to complete our responsibilities during record .
The confluence of important parts of the country is that the people of this state should not be able to stay safe , the person of the country also has worked everybody in those who have been able to give a state .
The responsibility of Hakullu , responsibility has been described in our state that is the speciality of our state .
In the life of the country these two members take the country ahead .
I recognized , in 2010 when 60 years of the state of India was completed , we swimming on the elephant of the state in Gujarat .
To increase the best position of the state in youth , it is an attempt to identify the estimation of the state .
In the year 2020 we complete fifty years in the form of a Ganesha . in 2022 we complete fifty five feet after coming to our independence .
If my favorite country Prajalara , state council , then the root of the state standing in the center of the state is unforgettable with the Mahabharata .
It is said that Praswamyam Babasaheb is in Narnarayan . Praswamyam of India has not come out from outside .
What is the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .
India fast ' - this is the main mantra of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedakar .
On the other hand the worshippers of Babasaheb Ambedakar Garden are the shrines of hearing .
Guru Nanak Dev had always been associated with the category of the people .
For the society he has seen the way of truth , action , service , mercy , self-confidence .
In the coming year Guru Nanak Dev celebrates the 550th Jayanti festival of the country . This festival spreads not only in the country but in the whole world .
All the state governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival honourably .
Similarly Guru Nak Garden 550 Jayant festivals are celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train is also run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak .
When I participated in a conference related to this then I remembered Lakh Pat Shah Gurudwara .
Due to the earthquake of Gujarat coming in 2001 this Gurudwara also got injured rapidly .
But along with the state government , local people this Gurudwara refreshed the archaeological exhibition is a example of this .
The Government of India has taken a big decision to make Kartarpur Karidar therefore the sacred place of Guru Nanak situated in Kartarpur of Pakistan can easily be seen .
Come , let us move ahead this journey .
Bat , October 2018 .
On 31th October 31th honey we all have the favorite surprising surdar Bhai Patel Jayant .
Like every year on that day also the youth of the country is ready to participate in the ' Run ' running for the unity of unity .
Now the weather is also pleasant .
Everybody is also impossible to participate in a large number of ' Runnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny ' .
Before coming independence six and a half months ago , on 27 January , 1947 the international journalist of the world famous international journalist ' Time magazine ' has discovered a collection on the journalists .
This journal has given a pattern of India in its Lid Street .
But it is not like India watching it .
It is the part of India divided into many parts .
There were approximately 550 national institutions in the country .
The interest of the British of India decreased but they wanted to go by making India pieces of pieces .
Time magazine has also discovered other stores of the life of man in his business .
He told how he was organised in the floods coming in Ahmedabad in 1920 , how Bardoli had discovered the guidance of truth .
Sirdar Patel has fulfilled the unforgettable task of making the country absolutely unforgettable .
All these India tied with Akyata Sutra , seeing our Bharatma , we remind us directly of the Sirdar Bhai Patel Patel .
Situated on the Narmada river in Gujarat this statue is double the height of America 's State of Liberty .
This is the biggest idol of the world .
Every Indian is now proud that the biggest statue of the world is in our country .
Till now the Sadar Patel dynasty surrounded by the earth now increases the sight of the sky .
It is natural to see this statue of every Indian Indian .
It is believed that people of every part of India consider this place as the most favorite place of this statue .
My beloved brothers , my beloved brothers , we celebrated all our country 's ' Infantry Day ' .
I am worshipping all the parts of Indian Army .
I am also selecting their adventurous games for our soldiers .
But why do all the people of our country celebrate this ' Infantry Day '
On this day our Indian soldiers saved Kashmir valley from the churches kept on the grass of Kashmir .
This historical incident also has direct relation with Sardar Valbh Bhai Patel .
I read an important Indian Army Talluku old interval -LRB- culture -RRB- once .
In this conference the field Marshal Sam Manexhaw , he remembered the days of his calculation .
At that time soldiers started fighting in Kashmir in October 1947 .
It is not possible to see the soldiers of Kashmir to send a team to Kashmir that in one conclusion the soldiers of Sadar Bhai Patel have also been reminded that in this conclusion the soldiers of Kashmir have also been able to fight their soldiers in Kashmir .
Who does not like the cost of my favorite country , sports .
Sports , strength , efficiency , capacity - all these are important .
These are a sports for a sports .
These four properties are so important for the construction of any country .
In the youth of the country all these qualities are there , that country is not only economic , science , technology but also flexes its victory in the campaign .
It is that I had discovered two times .
The Asian Para Games occurring in the first Jakarta got the opportunity to meet our para athletes in 2018 .
In this sports the entire India has increased the pride of our parathlets created by recording 72 pounds of India .
These parts have got the point of meeting their own personalities .
Similarly , the chances of meeting the summer yutholmpics occurring in Argentina were found to be 2018 .
You're happy to know that our youth in Youth Colimpics 2018 exhibited their everybody more than that.
In these competitions our country has spent three times apart from the thirteen decades of our country .
This time in Asia Cricket also our country keeps in mind that your country has cherished its everybody .
In some minutes how many times I used it as much as possible , see how much more important things like this .
India is not only in playing games but also in the form of imagination of India new records of India .
To spend life from the orthodox temple he did works like swimming in Dhabbal situated on the roads of Delhi .
That is why Narayan is participating in the international competitions , golden plates of India .
Not only this , see the capacity of increasing in India sports .
Nevertheless in Judo , Senior Level , Junior Level there was no alternative in both the Olympics .
But in the European Olympics the history of Tababi Devi has created the history of silver .
Sixteen youths stay in a village of Tababi Devi Manipur .
If the father goes to the cool , then the mother ' s fish was sold .
Many times there was no money for eating in their house .
In such a situation also the courage of Tababai Devi is not less .
The history has created history by gaining neck for the country .
Every youth , he is the identity of India .
My favorite country Prajalara , your everyone is remembered , we started FIFA in 2017 World Cup successfully .
The most successful tourism has given the world of Yavat .
FIFA Under17 World Cup also created a new Orissa in the number of viewers.
More than twelve lakh audiences from the stadiums of different places of the country enjoying the football competitions , encouraged the youth players .
This year the males of India have got the point of view of running in Bhubaneswar on 2018 .
Haki Wildlife Sanctuary starts from 28 November to 16 December .
Indians playing any kind of sports or some sports are definitely interesting i . . jewellery .
There is a golden history of India in Haki sports .
The mantra of Haki Mantra is known about the meditation of Major Meditation of the world .
After that Balvindar Singh Senior , Leslie Claudius -LRB- Leslie Claudius -RRB- , Mohammad Shahid , Udham Singh has decided a very big journey .
Now our team India players give inspiration to the new waves of the new waves with their industry , with their industry .
Seeing the exciting competitions is a good opportunity for the players .
You can go to Bhubaneswar and see the hockey matches , enjoy your players .
To organise my favorite country Prajalara , social programs many people are coming forward cleanly . They also stand inspiration to all the people of the country .
We can see this heritage of every place in our traditional society coming to thousands of centuries .
But in this new age , new waves are coming forward to do these tasks with new enthusiasm , new enthusiasm , new enthusiasm .
Its name is ' 4 ' society ' . My vow , IT , Electronic उद्योग of the country , they do not make their employees social programs , therefore they have done this portal .
Seeing the enthusiasm , excitement , excitement , excitement of this program all Indians become pride .
The journey from IT to society , not me , we , not jealousy , walking from ourselves is in it .
Some children read , some elders read .
If some attention is paid attention to cleanliness then some rails are helping .
There is no self-confidence behind all these . only the feeling of devotion , self-confidence .
A young man learned himself wheelchair basketball to help Divyang's wheelchair basketball.
Mission mode activity meaning this zeal is this dedicated feeling .
Definitely pride .
I am not ' I ' which gives inspiration to all of us .
My beloved brother-in-law , this time I see all your informations for ' Manki Baat ' , then from Pondicherry a interesting expanse of Sri Manish Mahabharata has been seen .
It is said that in his male Gau , how important examples of life along with the traditional traditions of Bharati giri , Acharya , nature you should say in the program of Manki Bath .
Mansh Garu , such things I am impossible to propose you before the balls of Manshi Garhwal .
To see our pride culture , past , this is the best opportunity to inspire us to see the past . This is the world , especially the western countries are celebrated to save environment .
Our India also faces this problem .
For its results we should look at once in us so that we should see our history , contacts once again .
Especially our tribal life style should be understood . It is in the culture of our tribal culture .
Our tribal brothers worshipped trees , trees , trees , fruits and goddesses .
The tribals living in Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh Garhwal region of Madhya Pradesh , Arjun trees are worshipped properly .
In the desert area like Rajasthan the society of Vishnu society has seen us how to conserve environment .
Especially in the case of protection of trees they are simple to make their lives soldiers but one tree does not even harm .
It is believed that Mishmi Tegs of Arunachal Pradesh are associated with tigers .
The tigers are considered to be their own guests .
In Nagaland also tigers are considered to be the protection of forests .
In the middle of India the nails of India stop fishing in some places of Kethan river in Briding Season .
Adivasis make their houses natural substances . along with being strong they also do good for procedure .
In south India the smoke living in the unparalleled areas of Nilgiri Peeth in southern India is made with small objects found in a traditional place .
It is true that my beloved brother Sodrimanula , tribal tribes believe that they will live peacefully , but nobody will harm their natural forests , they will not be afraid to fight for the guests .
In my favorite country Prajalara , Manki Baat we say that people doing extraordinary works for the society , institutions .
Seeing small , it is very deep effect on those tasks .
I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab for some days .
A common routine working in difficulty is married to the son of Gurubachan Singh .
Before this marriage Gurubachan dynasty married the parents of the parents of the parents , but I was a shirt .
But hearing the brother of a normal night asking Gurubachan all you will also be surprised . That is the true strength of our society .
Sri Gurubachan Singh 's family has kept an example before us .
I read another small village near Nabha of Punjab about Kallar Majra .
Why did this village of Kallar Majra come to the churches , the rest of the people there instead of burning in the field of corn , they are covered inside the soil , for which how much technology is necessary .
The brother Gurubachan Singh is my impression .
To keep the people of Kallar Majra clean , to keep the environment clean all the people trying to make their beauty clean .
You are walking ahead the true responsibilities of Indian tradition .
On mixing drops , chocolate , small precautions , good works , social works , always play an important role in making environment .
In life , heart , in me , in thy , in every cell of the world , peace has been established everywhere .
The 11th November coming to India is special because the first World War of India was completed on November 1111 .
The war was completed after the completion of war , when the loss of heavy loss occurring was completed one century .
First world war is an important incident of India .
If we want to say properly then we have no relation with Asla war .
Even then our soldiers fought with so much virtue , how big role was played , maximum sacrifices were given .
On the coming of war Indian soldiers see the world .
In the rare places , in the poisonous situations also our soldiers have seen their beauty .
The only purpose behind all these is to establish peace again .
The world has seen the destruction of the world in the first World War .
According to estimates approximately one fort soldiers , other forts people lost their lives .
That is why the world knows how important the peace is .
In the past the meaning of peace has changed .
This is peace , synonym meaning not only war .
From intensity to change in the environment , economic development has to change the social judgment .
Repeated person is the true signal of progressive peace .
My favorite country , our north-eastern states are different .
The natural beauty of this place is estimated . people here are the most part of the people here .
This award given for the best polio making in this hole is like association in that hole .
Besides this our Sikkim has spent this archaeologically crossing fifty naminated rulers from twenty five countries .
For this I told many impressions to the people of Sikkim .
My favorite country Prajalara , October .
There are many changes in the environment also .
Along with this the environment of festivals has also come . Dhan opening , Deepavali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat . if you want to say one way then the month of November .
All these festivals of the country are many ruins of all these festivals .
I want to all of you , not only your health in these festivals but also keep in mind your health .
These festivals also give opportunity to make new decisions .
Because of a museum you want to move ahead in life , do not want to make a strong contribution of these festivals a chance .
In the development of the country your growth is a major part .
As much as you have developed the country as much as possible .
All of you are many ruins of me .
