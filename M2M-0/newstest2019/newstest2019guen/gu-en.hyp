For the bunch of Somnath temple and ordinary Indians how can the Darbaric language of Sultan Mahmood Gazni of Khalnayak be Sanskrit

Nowadays Shri Somnath Trust honored Dr . Gautam Patel and Dr . Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit then Sanskrit was only a folk language that it was the language of the so-called upper classic Brahmins only , it was natural to have such a easy question .
The Pundit Glam of Mumbai was reminded of Dastagier Prince .
Reservoirs can also understand that the 87-year-old Pandits speaking in such simple Sanskrit are still giving the last form of lighting the Sanskrit scripture of the sacred uran .

Not only reading in the school of Solapur itself , but today they are included in the great Sanskrit scholars of the country counted as the fingers .
While living a simple life Panditji does not seek to give details of Sanskrit in America or other countries in order to make his marketing .
The royal prince of Thailand is the pundit of Sanskrit .
Sanskrit appears suddenly there itself .

According to the calculations of the year 2011 , Sanskrit is now being the mother tongue of only 24,821 people of the country , we have kept Sanskrit in a similar state of sight .
Nehru Thakki had also spoken of Sanskrit with great respect in the Bandharan Sabha too .
