1000 farmers arrive in High Court in front of Bullet Train, Dream Project for Development of Gujarat
For the Central Government's Dream Project Bullet Train, a High Court has been filed before the farmers of Gujarat to acquire land.
During the hearing of the petition, 1,000 farmers have no right to acquire their land by offering sacrifices to the State Government.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Central Government that if the Central Government does not respond to land acquisition on the 26th of this month, the Court will order the final.
The High Court has also redressed the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court.

On behalf of the farmers, Advocate Anand Yagyake had said that for the country's most expensive project of 1 lakh 10 thousand crore connected with more than one state, the central government does not respond to it for more than three months, it does not even follow the guidelines of the company.

Black melting is being done to seize land due to new conditional lands.
If the land is not harvested then it will be confiscated.
The Central Government is not responding to the High Court by ordering the Supreme Court on 10th August.

Internationally, China seeks to make UAN an international currency at the level of euro, yen and pounds, including dollars.
India and Russia are exploring possibilities to make this deal in rupee and rubble by looking at the potential for economic sanctions from the US.
International Desk: India and Russia today have agreed on the S-400 Defence Missile System between the US-backed regimes.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia will be meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
On the way to sanction S-400 Deals, it is engaged in extracting the route between the two countries from US Dollars to US Dollars for payment of the deal.
Friends, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupee and rubble in view of the potential for economic sanctions from the US.
US ban on China's Deal
It may be mentioned that in September, Russia had dealt with S-400 missiles with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to ban China.
Due to this restriction, the purchase of Missile was almost impossible by using US dollars for China.
However, during the last few years, China tried to raise its Currency Uan as an international posture rather than a dollar.
After this initiative, China has been consistently trying to make UAN an international currency equivalent to euro, yen and pounds, including dollars.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of US dollars in international trade.
China wants to make Yuan an international posture
The Mega Defence Deal of USD 5 billion can be imposed on US CATSA (Countering American Advertising Thru Sections- CATSA).
Last month, the US banned the purchase of S-400 missile systems on China.
India and Russia had already started setting up an alternative mechanism for this deal.
Earlier, the US ban on the INS Chakra's repair deal, which was leased from Russia, led to an estimated 2 billion US dollar deal between India and Russia.
Economic analyst claims that India should use Rupee-Ruble Exchange as an international posture to come out of such a situation.
It is worth mentioning that all the defence deals with Russia so far have been made through dollars.
Why is the Cutsa Act of America
President Donald Trump in August, in view of this modern defence missile system in Russia, approved the CATSA Act to prevent Russia from acting against US interests at international level.
It may be mentioned that the US Act has been prepared keeping in view the Russian activities.
This includes attacks on Russian side by attacking Ukraine on Cremia in 2014, participation in the Syrian civil war and the 2016 US Presidential election.

Was he shocked by reading the scriptures
How can a definite language of Sultan Mahmud Ghazni of such a Ghazni contributing to the ordinary Indian and the Somnath temple be Sanskrit
In fact, the research by Professor Shanti Pandey, the historian of Delhi University, has shown that the Rajbhasha of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
Recently, Shri Somnath Trust felicitated Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit, when Sanskrit was only a folklore of the so-called hierarchy, it was natural to have such a simple question.
The Pandit Ghulam Dastagiri of Mumbai was remembered.
The 87-year-old pundits who spoke in a simple Sanskrit script are still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the holy uran before the publication.
The word sacred uran is Sanskrit from his point of view.
u Ran means the sound of the preacher on earth.
Not only this, he is among the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country who have studied in Solapur's school today.
However, while leading a life of simplicity Panditji does not seek to describe himself as a pundit of Sanskrit in the United States or other countries for his marketing.
The princess of Thailand is a pundit of Sanskrit.
Sanskrit teaches itself there.
To learn Sanskrit from America, eager ones have to go to Bone University in Germany.
In India not only in Banaras Hindu University but in most of the universities Ph . . of Sanskrit also it is written in the language of the state .
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati but it should be remembered that education was imparted only through Sanskrit medium in Texasila and Nalanda Universities.
Sanskrit has been preached in Afghanistan. Shanta Pandey has said that not only was sheer Sanskrit language of Ghazni's Sultan, she also noted that she had also written her financing books in Sanskrit.
He has also noted the significance of the uran in Sanskrit on Mahmud Suratran and that Panini, the creator of Sanskrit lecture, resides in Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru has said that in the philosophy of Maru Hind, a large version of Sanskrit Language has been descended from Sanskrit by Afghan and the Pushtu Language of Readers in Shakti and Sustainable Shakti.
Today, everyone accepts that not only Indian languages but Indo-European languages have also emerged from Sanskrit.
Dr. Ambedkar and other members of the Muslim and South Indian Constituent Assembly proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
On the 13th September , 1949 in the constituent assembly of English against Hindi , when there were discussions about the national language then among the proponents of Sanskrit were the deputy foreign minister Dr . . . Keskar and Nazaruddin Ahmed .
Considering that day's discussion and the report published in the National Herald of 11 September 1949, the bullying of Sanskrit language is estimated.
Even today, we have not been able to decide any national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, occupy the position of official language in our Constitution and not national language.
As per the population calculations of 2011, Sanskrit has now been the mother tongue of only 24,821 people of the country.
Prime Minister Nehru also spoke of Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly with great respect.
In his epic, the Sanskrit has been narrated and the world's scholars have narrated the importance of Sanskrit: Sir Williams Jones in the Saal of 1874 said, "How ancient is the Sanskrit language, knowing God, its creation is amazing.
It is full of Greek language, more wives than Latin and more than that.
Nehru adds: "I don't know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language i. e.
Now as a member of the Sanskrit language prayer or as a Member of Parliament, Union Minister Smriti ubin Irani has been the only language to swear.
We need to revive the years of Sanskrit and make it a living and folklore.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived, then Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is a matter of pride if we make a serious effort to make it a folk-speaking or rather than a symbolic effort.
