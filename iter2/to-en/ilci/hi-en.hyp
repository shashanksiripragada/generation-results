Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat is therefore a mixture of both in language .
This is called ' kutchi ' .
Well it is ' bidding ' , it is not its own script .
If you have to write Kutchi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have taken place and the entire city has collapsed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the path from where we had come then we will have to take a full month 's holiday and on the other hand we will open schools in Bombay .
So what to do  Now by calling the fast buses of Gujarat Taa Taa Taa Taa will travel in the railways .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad the big train of broad gauge will reach Bombay .
The tourism industry which is considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and increasing terrorist threats in South Asia tourism has reached a deep push .
With the point of view of tourism a considerable reduction has been achieved in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan being included among the major states of the country these days .
The latest figures released by the Rajasthan government show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 natives and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 domestic and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana holiday makers says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
From the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With respect to tourism the recent years have passed best for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , bawaris , forest everything is that old for the tourists to enjoy .
In the area of tourism all the governments talk about working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan along with foreign lady tourists have also stained the image of this state at an international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in the state but it has remained confined to paper only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) is an example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of boosting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , traffic , boating etc to the tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The RTDC deficit in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that even in the last five years forty percent of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also bringing it a big loss .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attracted towards this train .
Despite reducing the fare this could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village made by RTDC this number decreased to 217 this year .
In the midst of all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth of the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Shahi Train .
This railway is continuously benefitting .
Last year, RTDC got a profit of Rs 9.5 crore from this train.
With this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see worries in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the heart of man , he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by settling the modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
The dream he had dreamt of is glad to see him progressing day by day .
His joy was also seen at the time of the opening of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Embay Valley started and today Embay Valley has been able to make its place as a great city .
In this city spread in more than 10 , 000 acres only hotels , houses and other facilities have been built on 9  land .
Trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available on 91 percent land .
Several industrialists came forward to build their own houses in this city built for millionaires and today there are about 800 families living in this city .
At first , industrialists and monks bought their ashes here in the form of holiday home but now they have made it their first home and from here they are going to Mumbai for work .
Behind the Ambe Valley itself is the Koyarigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this area .
In the western Siang district the ruins of Likawali are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple excavation of lotus and goddesses has been obtained which are mostly in a fragmented state .
Malini Than is an important place in this area .
At this place a decorated idol of Goddess Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the glory of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the period of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was believed to be far - off .
The tribes here used to worship Goddess .
Human sacrifice was also offered here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are situated in the middle of the Dibang and Divang rivers .
According to the stories prevailing here this place is the old Vidarbha , where once king Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmakunda is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , a famous place in the Lohit district .
The tribes of Deegaru , Mishmi etc . here guide the travellers .
These people themselves have great faith in the Kunda .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimage places of Arunachal , the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The relics of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their story .
Surrounded by pucca caves of bathing , pucca stairs and another pond and the relics of wide roads are still singing silently of its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from four hours through jeep from North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant mountainous place hypnotise the tourists .
This is the charming place where emergency lives .
It used to take several days to reach here before the jeep path was made .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premierezes , walnuts , wild currents , strawberries and rasberries disturb the tourists .
Apples and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of about 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of emergency people .
With their tireless hard work , the emergency people have made it their heaven .
The cultivation of rice is very good here .
This place is a ' rice reserve ' .
This ten - miles long plateau is a living example of their hard work and their efficiency in cultivation .
Their irrigation needs are met by the Kali river .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley by four folds .
In the middle of the snowclad mountain range of the left hand the sight emerging on the horizontal horizon falls on a slight redness .
There is a lot of cold in the air .
Along with the pricking coolness in the environment one also feels the moisture .
A layer of wood can be seen below the legs with the sound of garbage .
There is softness in the atmosphere and there is nothing more visible because of the shadow of the sunrise .
Eyes remain red on the redness of the east .
I feel like sitting on a bench lying in a balcony .
On applying the hand the smooth layer of the palm glitters with the sound of a slight rash and the hand separates from the shock by the feeling of coolness .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this spent most of the time in Geneva or nearby .
The densely populated population on either side of the thin stream of Balakati river is spread on very high slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Rhone valley , on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the crawling trains on it have begun to clear .
The distance of 300 kms and half an hour journey of half an hour from the car is halfway parallel to the Geneva lake and half a rock river coming from the east side meet in the Geneva lake near the city named Montreu which is called Deccemon -LRB- Lock Lama -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake .
From there the lake moves towards the west after becoming a river again .
On the right side across the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk we reach the mountainous path of the north except this highway from the acquaintance of the left side .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southward the sun of Aprahan is giving a lot of sunshine to all the fans .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of ice is less here - approximately not less .
As they move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite heavy snow being frozen on both sides of the road there is no special coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
On this curved hilly road after covering a journey of about 20 kms we reach a small village named Thel .
Halet - There are big multi - storeyed bungalows with slopy roofs , fully wooden .
In the basement made of cement concrete of this three storied bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , ladri etc . along with parking of trains .
Valay is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes of grapes .
37  of the entire cantonment is cultivated by grapes .
In the villages settled on both sides of the Ron valley the gardens of grapes provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking wineards of grapes , touring them , getting night rest in the villages there and taking them to the factories of grapes wine testing is an integral part of tourism business here .
In a small town named Aigle there is a huge museum of grapes made in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to get artificial bookings done .
Once again we pass through the midst of the same jungle after being buried with the cavalry .
Mind becomes even more distressed by the pricking questions of children throughout the way up to three - four kms .
Suddenly at a turn , the scene brings about dramatic and charming changes .
Right in front , on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful herd of houses is settled .
On the flat slope from above the village people are skiing in the snow .
Above the skiing slope till the top of the mountain the dense forest of cedar is spread .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining due to the fall of the direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same silence is resting .
From the peak of the mountain all around to the valley the kingdom of Dhawal snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a large roundabout in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Luckerabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from the fact that here there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for the stay of 1500 , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
So far 65 sleeves of hot water have been found in Lukarabad .
4 million litres -LRB- up to 51 o ' clock -RRB- coming out of these , the whole town of water is reached in about 30 small and big thermal pools , some pools are within five star hotels and others are according to the pockets of people of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
A thick layer of ice is shining above the roof of the houses in blooming sunshine .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the preserved places in the form of the heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxis , that is why there is no checking .
The journey is continuing , the region is second , but the mountains are the same , the trees are the same , the rough winds are there .
He is the moisture all over the body .
Surmai light is the same in the rainy season .
As soon as the plan for the Darjeeling tour was confirmed , the first thing to do was to take a look at Karsingh .
Curseong is a small town in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunny jungles .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we moved towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning itself the tea gardens welcome the people moving towards it while smiling .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens hypnotise the mind for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of forests , and on the other side deep green trench .
Sometimes jungles and tea gardens were seen here .
There was a greenery empire all around .
Once upon a time I was stunned to see these natural jungles or to the tea planted by man .
Both of them were drawing towards themselves .
The beautiful forest was as beautiful as the tea garden .
If you would have seen the roads on the way then the creation looks marvellous .
The snake ' s snake moved and the circular path was passing .
The time had passed .
If not , the jungle and the tea garden .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance , a hilly house , etc . appeared very dense .
It was cursing .
Staying at one place here we made a program to roam around the whole day .
So we set out on a tour of Karsingh with a car .
First dire park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests .
The vehicle had to be left very low to reach up to the top climb i . . deer park .
Despite the beauty of Kurseong , it has not yet been known as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the path amidst the sunshine trees was giving us courage .
The next place was the Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at the height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to jump and die from here .
At present , it is equipped with a park and a restaurant .
There is a ladder like dome here , from the height of which on observing the whole city beautiful scenes are present .
In the tea gardens nearby women were eager to break the tea garden running fast with baskets on their backs .
Cursing is a museum outside the city , but on that day we could not go there , because it seemed necessary to tour the free environment of tea gardens .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a matter of great concern that if it was raining then how would we roam 
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed the blooming sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining .
On moving a little more below from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The view of waterfalls amidst rocks here is spectacular .
We found in Rock Garden that waterfalls are decorated in the kingdom of stones and rocks then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is rich with stones .
Both of these places are located very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
After getting up with the support of the car we saw a familiar loop in Darjeeling .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was still smooth .
But as soon as we moved towards Monastery , where did we come down , we began to shine .
In the evening there was a plan to roam and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling television trains enhance the beauty of the journey .
Travelling from Darjeeling to Dhauladhar to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake here and a temporary break in the garden .
From this route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but the movement of forests and waterfalls is there .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forest - waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam Darjeeling in the shade of coolness , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me with itself .
A small journey of my recent past was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither abroad nor outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , a ship of water or some royal train or a city like a pink city or a Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come to the fore .
The place I am going to talk about is just ready four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come here has really turned into a jungle .
not only for those who go there , but also for those who stay there .
In my ears my guide resonates with the words of Ram Babu Meena : ' We couldn ' t even imagine before that we could live in the forest like this .
Fifty percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt so many locals didn ' t even get a job at the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajbgarh , used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He has turned his own speech into a new colour .
Sahiba ' is the prediction of Aman Bagh .
There no one calls you from English utterance .
Aman garden is indeed a sanctuary with peace and comfort .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you to the nearby areas .
In the royal style of Rajasthan how many people would have toured Bhangarh of the past , why should I go away , some of the people of Jaipur would probably have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman garden big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there with a strong heart , but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had gone to Bhangarh by wandering .
This time suddenly I reached there at the feast of my foreign guests , then it seemed as if those who want to spend a magnificent holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Aman Garden .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
It was built in nineteen , hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Garden charms you .
As soon as you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it takes you to know that divine peace has been paid attention here .
In the wrist , the mantra of Mangalachara is pronounced lively .
We had reached the slope in the evening and decided to set up a garden .
My host Jackie , who has been a gentleman , suddenly said , This is interesting . 
All are inspired by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic it was not surprising that Aman Garden had also received prizes recently .
The manager set out our programme for the morning .
First of all , a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey to Bhangarh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
He saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
Such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience for Jackie .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are million dollars precious moments .
The way of saying goodbye to Aman Bagh was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they sent us away .
Now we understood why the tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing Tribal Life .
Is this right .
Undoubtedly this is not the same in many states and tourists also show great interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks time and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places where there has not been much development and where time has not had any special effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Also where old tourist sites etc . are present .
Besides this , attention is also given to serving the Traditional uiz .
Actually , the purpose of such tours is to make the tourists aware of the ways and ways of living of that place .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without being disturbed .
Yes , it is very important that along with giving a lot of time in less expense and comfort these tours definitely keep a demand of patience with you .
This is the reason that for enjoying these it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching any foreign destination bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior officers of the military , children etc get discount on them , then there is an arrangement of discount for two people as well .
However , it is cheaper to buy tickets in advance , so it is better to do bus tour in the last moments than plan a little before .
Please know about the round trip rather than the ticket .
They are cheap .
The rules regarding baggage are very strict , therefore inquire about the size and weight of the goods .
It may not be that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or you have to pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensation of insurance or loss from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , take it .
Because they fit in the rack over the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus you will have the responsibility of luggage on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the Biji season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat option will be with you .
While choosing the seat take care of the confirmation .
If there are more shocks in the previous seat , it is not conferable to read in the next seats .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now it ' s a trick .
If you are both in a hurry to grab , then sit on the corner seat and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in bus then keep this in mind while sucking the seat , because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identification by bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get enough information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can find a new passenger in your place and you have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if Rome did not see in Europe , he could not see anything .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of those old cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .
This is the reason that its impression is seen on Western Civilization .
Rome settled on the Taibre river is a pilgrimage for the followers of Roman Catholic religion because the residence of the chief  Pope ' of this religion is in Rome itself .
Ancient Rome was settled on seven hills .

This magnificent statue will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on Capitalline is also a different identity of this building .
A church , museum and ancient temple are also built in  Capitalline Complex ' .
The symbol of Rome is colosium .
The construction of this huge arena was done in 80 AD and 50 , 000 spectators could sit together .
Gladiators i . . swordmen used to show their feats in the colosseum .
They competed not only among themselves but also with wild animals .
These terrible fights , whether by other swords or by animals , continued until one of the fighters died .
In ancient Rome there used to be many ' forums ' .
Lets say that places of meeting are called forums in Rome .
All the activities like social , religious , economic , political etc used to take place here .
Among these the most famous forum was Romanam and the remains of Raj Bhavan , temples and pillars are present even today .

Pathian . This wonderful ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
In the middle of its huge dome there is an open space of 30 feet .
Because of this place devotees felt as if their prayers are directly reaching the gods .
Inside the temple idols of deities are made all around .
By the way , in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome but Villa Borgis is unmatched .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see it .
Definitely go to the museum built here also , because on missing this you will miss the opportunity to face the best sculpture .
The statues built here are unique and seem so alive as if they are speaking now .
Here on the bed of Napoleon ' s first sister Paulin , who was married to Borgis royal family , an idol lying on the bed seems so lively that you will not be able to see it lonely for a while .
The special attraction of Rome is its fountains .
There are approximately 300 such buildings in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevy Fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come back to Rome then he should put a coin in the fountain along with this wish .
It is believed that by doing this the desire is surely fulfilled .
The journey to this ancient city will not be complete until you see ' Vatican City ' .
Since the sixth century this place has been the residence of the highest religious head  Pope ' of the followers of Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome itself , but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
You must see the famous St . Peter 's Church , St . Peter 's Square , Fountains , Museum etc . of Vatican City .
Of course they will show you the view of a different world and will always give you the feeling of remembering .

Located in the capital of Goa Panjim , Ginger Hotel makes this journey of the western shore excellent .
Taking full enjoyment of cycling , river cruise , cold sea breeze and world famous Goan dishes on the roads of Goa the Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option .
If seen on today 's date then for Maldives the fare of the cheapest per person from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Mala then you can also get hotels on a little rent but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
C cruise proves beneficial here .
In the first week of December , Louis Cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise for the Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems the Louis cruise has postponed its services , but they are expected to start again from October .
On Louis cruise ship MV Aquamarin you can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per person per night .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two grow older children below 15 years of age are absolutely free .
And what else is required .
The cruise fares include tea and snacks , all food .
Enjoyment of every time together .
After reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a plane stands in front of you while roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel like a toy .
But this twin oteral plane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent for roaming like Maldives in Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- .
When it gets up in the air , running like a speed boat on the surface of the water , it is not known .
You don ' t have the experience of flying aeroplanes all over the flight .
Each time your eyes remain strong below the window - watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
How clear everything looks .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Tros Maldives is one of them having twenty c planes .
If you want you can roam around for an hour in about four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or you can hire the entire sea plane for a long time -LRB- provided the pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go to any island beyond Male Island then the journey of Sea Plane will be necessary because this is the only way of traveling between different islands .
And that ' s a journey that might never end up with you .
Sea Plane takes the journey from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavilevaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovereign shop of the capital in Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the salesmen were listening very carefully to the speech given by Mohammad Nasheed to the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen one day before the Maldives .
Saying sincerely I have not seen any Hindustani listening to the speeches of the presidents or the prime minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of an unmatched creation of this earth , it was so serious that it was imperative .
Many people might have understood the meeting done by the cabinet of Maldives in October to be a boon , but going to Maldives it feels as if the nature ' s wrath snatches it from us then how bad will the world be .
There is something similar in its beauty .
In that small country it was as if it was not so beautiful .
Returning from that stroll of the market towards Jetty for going back to its cruise , when eyes went in the water of the sea along with the bushes of the road then we realized how far people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of the lamppost floating fish in depths of several metres were visible with all its colours .
This was part of the sea which was very close to the city .
You will find yourself lucky even if you can see a few centimetres clean in the sea or river waters adjacent to any city of India .
M . V . , while returning to Aquamarin , was roaming around for two hours in the evening in the garland .
Coral reef -LRB- Muga rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will find muga rocks on the stones on the graves .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
We were not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security personnel far and wide .
Interestingly we were pulling photographs of gardens and verandahs just fifty metres away by stretching our hands inside the gate of his bungalow .
Can you think of a leader ' s house in India 
It was also known that Presidents sometimes reach their office two blocks ahead crossing the roads on foot .
Everything about the Maldives was going to be overwhelmed .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
Ilham was supposed to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of the Trass Maldives while roaming around the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near the garland then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing above .
So many pictures he had seen .
But it was not supposed to be a ride the next day .
We were about to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the Tros Maldives ' C plane .
Watching hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres was unforgettable .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a breathtaking flight with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel on Rangali Island it seemed as if we had reached some other world .
In a world that had nothing to do with any outside world .
It was not like this that it was difficult to get the beauty or luxury out there .
There can be a stroll on the Konarrad as well as a battery operated car .
The view of water life on both sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was amazing .
Right now we could not even comfort ourselves with the nature around us , it was unimaginable that we reached such a place .
Several metres below the stairs while descending into the sea water we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides crossing the mirrors we could see unique types of small fish , corals , snorekelling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating and drinking on decorated tables there was extremely exciting in itself .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch on this island in sea plane from Male is 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no intention of returning from there .
We were ready to shed our passports in water .
But he knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we returned with the same expectation that at some point of time fate will definitely bring here .
For many days he was planning to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Since childhood Wildlife was fond of , I thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour after the biking of Pegong Lake ahead of Khardungla Pass in 2006 .
In the early hours of December 27 we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the excitement that had come out of the fog shook our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
Fog from above and bad road in front .
Sometimes it seemed that he had fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o ' clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
There was no special programme on that day , despite being cold we went to roam on the edge of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum which was near Dhangri Gate , 2 kilometres away from extremely difficult .
From there we went down to roam around Ramnagar .
It was late in the evening .
It was decided from Delhi that if I see a lion roaming around in the jungle then I kept looking at the lions all night .
Suddenly I heard a tremendous roar in the midst of the depths of the night , and the dogs who began to bark after that did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first suggestion came to roam around Kaladhungi and Corbett Fall .
Kaladungi is 30 km away , while Carbet Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
It was twelve o'clock in the morning while returning .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this pocket only .
On reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged for singing in the number one site Bijrani there .
On asking about number one it was told that Grasland is more there and tigers come towards it to prevent cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the forest inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , whose long teeth were .
I did a lot of photography .
Meanwhile the guide started tracking the tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of whom have died recently .
At many places we also saw marks of their claws , but I was sad because of not seeing Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
I had a tiger ride in my mind .
Then I remembered one of Haldwani ' s old friends .
I telephoned him like that .
I told him I had come to Carbet .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
His words pierced like arrows .
I said softly , No .
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a safari inside .
