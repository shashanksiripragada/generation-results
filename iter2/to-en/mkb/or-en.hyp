The most remarkable thing about Gurudev Rabindranath was that he was not only the first person in Asia to win the Nobel Prize in 1913, the British distinguished him from the Night Ups and in 1919, when the British had distributed victory in Jallianwala Bagh, Rabindranath was one of those individuals and the greatest persons who laid down their lives against the British Government and a small child in 12 years of age.
The vision of Jallivanawala Bagh massacre in the minds of a small child playing in rocky conditions awakened a new inspiration and in 1919 the 12-year-old boy, Bhagwad, was an inspiration for us as Shahid Bhagat Singh.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, Bhagsingh, his friend, Sukhdev and the princely princely state, was thrown out by the British Government and everyone knows that the event of 23rd March was the emotion of serving Mother India at the mouth of Bhagwan Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, which was the emotion of serving Mother India.
He dedicated all the dreams of life to the service of Mother India.
And these three brave martyrs are a source of inspiration today.
We cannot describe the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.

Once there was anger and dissatisfaction, we should start doing something against cleanliness.
It is a good fact that Gayatri is propagating his anger, suggesting to me and also saying that he has failed many times.
I know some youngsters who have launched this kind of campaign.
We cannot understand such an incident even in our vicinity, even if we are hesitant to talk about it openly.
He who feels depression does not say anything to himself because he remembers himself ashamed.

I urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country, and those who have received the awards under this scheme of DG-Dhan Business, to take the leadership of this movement, whether it is Rashtriya Khel or Ambassador.

Sometimes we don't see the experiment with the right vision.
However, it is a question of life-threatening.
The test that you are going to give is an experiment of your reading year after year.
This is not an experiment of your life.

Therefore, when we are burdened with this number, we are forced to follow the right path.

A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have made rapid strides in start-ups.
This digital event is a golden opportunity.
Our youngsters, with new emotions and thoughts, with new technologies and new systems, should emphasize the importance of this field but we have to be associated with the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.

Once again they have acknowledged this challenge and I believe that the resolutions of 125 crore Indians, all inclusive efforts will give a new strength to this nation.
However, the scam is so huge that we do not leave the bad habits of some people even now.
Some people still feel that the money of this scam, this black money, the money paid by this account, the money paid by this bank, will come back to the system once again.
They are looking for BAIN to save their wealth.
It is a matter of sadness that they also preferred the way to use the poor.
Some people are trying to save the wealth by misleading the poor, by encouraging them to deposit the money in their accounts or by doing any work by them.
A lot of laws have been enacted for Benami Property and there will be a lot of trouble in the system.

We will carry forward this struggle to free the country from corruption and black money.
The people from far flung areas will realise that the Indian public life is the fate of the festival and it is natural.
It is the festival of lighting the lamps of the candlesticks, the darkness of the evildoers, the darkness of the individuals, the light of the candlesticks.
One thing we all know very well that if we go to any place of India, if we go to the houses of the richest of the rich, if we go to the doorsteps of the poorest of the poor then on the occasion of Deepavali, every family gets to see the cleanliness drive.
I mean to say that the festival of light is going to inspire the people of the world to move from darkness to light.
When we are celebrating the candlestick, somebody is standing in the wilderness, somebody is protecting the environment in the peak country of Himalaya, somebody is protecting the industry.
Apart from this, I would like to say that along with the army officers and the soldiers, their families also sacrifice their lives.
In a way, the entire Armed Forces are getting very good messages and I also want to give you an appy.

I bow down to all these brave soldiers and pay my tributes to them.
The citizens of Kashmir are fully aware of the anti-national power and after knowing the truth, they have broken themselves away from such people and gone out on the path of peace.
However, I would also like to say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country is also very much valued.
This time, very few people would know how these disabled persons have demonstrated their power in the Paralympics.
Not only that, I was surprised to know that among the Divyang people who stayed in the fourth position in the run up to the fourth position and did not receive any medal, they also took less than the gold medal winners among the general category competitors.
Congratulations to all those who have done this work, best wishes to those who have tried to do this.

In some cases, it has happened that the performance of our sportspersons has not reached that level and only two medals have been received in the medal list.
However, it is also true that for the first time in many sports, India's players have performed well for the first time when they saw the reality of not getting medals.
Something like this happened with the combination of Shani Mirza and Rohan Bopana in Tennis.
Many sportspersons are like Aditya Ashoka, Uttanal, Atanu Das, who have a good performance.
But, my dear countrymen, we have to do a great deal.
And if we do what we have to do, we shall be troubled again.
I have made an announcement about the formation of a committee.

Lord Ganesh breach destruction.
Therefore, we will build glasses that will create destruction.
We always have to learn something from the saints, from the saints, from the sages, from the great men.
I also congratulate all the stakeholders for their contribution in the foreign policy of the country.

You can imagine that an ordinary teacher, an adult lady with a pension money, is giving 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers to get rid of smoke and gas connections.
And with the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, there is hope and strength for the future of my country.
Those who try to create unrest in Kashmir by placing these small children in front of them will have to be accountable for sometime or the other.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, full of diversity.

I cannot mention all the states, but they are capable of congratulating them.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
