Man Ki Batt , October 2019 .
My beloved country , bow down .
Everybody has many ruins in the contribution of Deepavali .
It is said that the light in this world brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys antagonism and visions.
Festival tourism is a special attraction of the world .
In our country there is an unparalleled opportunity of festivals in national festivals .
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My beloved countrymen, we have decided to do something new for this Deepavali in Mann Ki Baat.
On seeing such a thing in social stories counted in social meditations have been displayed .
This day our brethren are in good professions.
She is really Indian Lakshmi .
Ramsh Garu , and your mother ' s wife is my blessing .

My beloved countrymen , 17th century famous Kavaitri Sanchi had written a poem in the Kannada language at that time .
These emotions , those substances , Indian Lakshmans , now we say that the foundation of all we have been done there .
How important things , how important emotions , how important thoughts are poet in Kannada .
Because of the magnificence of these artificial magnificence our society is the future of our society .
My beloved countrymen, on 12 November 2019, Shri Guru Nanak Devji will celebrate the 550th light festival of Guru Nanak Devji all over the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not in India but in the whole world .
Our brothers and sisters of Sikkim reside in many countries of the world , they are completely unparalleled for the museum of Guru Nanak Devji .
I have never forgotten the journey that I have done to the Gurudwara of Vancouver .
How can I tell you about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, but it has to be a lot of episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the place of service .
It is believed that Guru Nanak Devgarh was invaluable service done with emotional emotions .
They were opposite to social misconceptions like unconsciousness .
Shri Guru Nanak Devgarh has displayed his message from far off places of the world .
They were one of those who traveled more during their time .
They went to many places, wherever they went, they spent their hearts with their silence, humility and simplicity.
Taking good , equal messages they went to all directions in the north - east west , everywhere people , saints , sages .
It is believed that the famous Sadhu Shankar Dev of Assam also got support from them .
They traveled the sacred Haridwar .
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
Sri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Rajgir, Gaya of Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev had traveled Sri Lanka .
During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During one Udasi, Guru Nanak Dev visited the neighbouring areas of Kashmir in the north.
They traveled to Uzbekistan , there also worshipped .
In Udasi, he also travelled heights to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They have bought in the minds of lakhs of people and those people have followed their teachings with complete devotion , today they are following .
Approximately 85 countries Raibar had gone to Amritsar from Delhi .
The Golden Temple of Amritsar is visited there , Guru Nanak Devji is present in the year 550 .
All these residents there not only visit Golden Temple , but also have the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji is my best wish to bring his thoughts and ideals into our lives.
Then once I bowed my head and prayed to Guru Nanak Devji .
It is believed that my beloved brotherhoodrimanala , October 31 you will definitely remember all .
If you read about Sardar Saheb style , then it is known how strong their planning is .
In order to participate in the Kangras Summit in Ahmedabad in 1921, thousands of people from all over the country have to come here.
All the administrations of Samadhishwar were on Sardar Patel .
He also used the issue to illuminate the network of water supply in the city.
Who has been built without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be surprised to know that every person's things, shoes, shoes were not stolen in the meeting place.
They contacted with rails , made minerals .
At the same time the victory of Khadi was also shining .
For playing the role of Ulkhani in the state the Sardar Patel of our country has always been dependent .
As if there is no chance of diversity occurring on the basis of Kullu , tradition they have done the main work of determining primary hiccups .
We all know that a great Bhagirathi , historical program was organised by the Sadar Ballabhbhai Patel Institute of India .
You know very well that the group of some islands is Lakshadweep .
After the division of India in 1947 the sight of our neighbouring country is on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Immediately after knowing this news of Sardar Patel he took difficult churches without losing time .
Brothers and sisters of Priyaar, Arcot Ramswamy, and Arcot Lakshmanswamy etc. told them: "Travel Core is the first ever Trivandrum in Lakshadweep.
Immediately with his country Trivarna Patna had discovered all the neighbours of Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I believe that these beautiful islands and sea shores will be visited by you.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity, a reminder of Sardar Patel on October 31, 2018, has been dedicated to the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is twice higher than the Statue of Liberty of America .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
On an average, about eight and a half thousand people visited the Statue of Unity.
Sardar Ballabhbhai Patel has declared his belief , devotion of his mind , besides this there are many attractive centres like Cocts Garden , Batter Flight Garden , Jangil Safari , Children New Jersey Park , Ekta Nursery etc .
Everyday there is a new opportunity for the people and the convenience of the tourists is being provided to the people of many villages in their homes.
We are witness to how a place developed in a year as a world famous tourist area .
People come here from the country and abroad .
The government has played its role .
Brothers and sisters, Time Magazine in the midst of this cannot be proud of any Hindustani in terms of the importance of the Statue of Unity in 100 major tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that all of you will take some time to see the Statue of Unity in your invaluable time.
Every Indian who wants to travel in tourism, stays there for at least 15 tourist destinations in India.
Brothers and sisters, you know that from 2014 every year we are celebrating 31st October as the International Day of Importance.
Today, we intend to save our country's unity and integrity in such situations.
On 31 October again arrangements are being done for Ran Far University .
We have been looking at the last five years - not only in Delhi but also in hundreds of cities of India, in central areas, in states, in district centres, in smaller tour three cities, a large number of women residents, villagers, children, young people, elderly people, Divyangs and everybody in large numbers.
That is why in today 's time we are seeing an interest in people on Marathon .
Run Fort University is also a special opportunity .
Running mind , brain is beneficial for body .
Therefore, not only the body but also the mind and culture to bring India to new heights for the unity of India.
Therefore you are in any city where you can know about the Ran Fort University nearby .
I believe that on 31st October India will definitely participate in the race for your fitness.
My beloved country residents , Sardar Patel sit in the Ikta Sutra .
The AICTAM mantra is like our life culture and in the country with diversities like India, we have to strengthen the mantra of AICTA in every way, in every turn, in every museum.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been conscious and conscious to fulfil the shared values of the country.
If we see around us then many such examples are found , in those examples they are seen continuously working to increase mutuality .
Organisations try to make those situations according to their own benefits in their own way .
How many types of words were spoken to increase the temperature in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some scholars , important guests are not only known for their famous people who talk about themselves .
We remember how responsible things are talking .
But all these five days , seven days , ten days are going on , but on coming to judgment a pleasant , surprising change has seen the country .
On one hand it has been done to increase the excitement of two weeks , but on coming to Ramjanmabhoomi the government , political birds , social institutions , all the traditions of the society , society , society , society , society , society , society , society , everybody has been exhibited with excellence .
Try to reduce stress in the environment .
But those days I remember very well now .
The dignity of the courts has been acknowledged with pride, where there is no scope for enhancing excitement and heat.
These things should always be kept in mind that they give us strength .
Those days those symptoms , do us symptoms .
It is an example of this that how much energy gives the country to the country .
On the day of a big injury to the country .
I also dedicate my faith today .
My beloved countrymen, today we have heard a story from afar off the shores of the house that every village tells a story from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from the east to the corners of Hindustan that is a clean story.
Every person , every family , every village wants to tell his pleasant experiences related to cleanliness because the efforts of cleanliness are hundred thirty crore Hindustan .
Their fruits are also hundred crore Hindustan .
There is an experience of making a pleasant thrill .
Not only to separate the garbage in it , this arrangement is also very important .
In it , to remove garbage on 130 tonnes around glacier , this is the biggest service there .
That is also the place of Ecosystem living in rare species of snow leopards where there are rare animals like Siachen species , wheat colored bears .
We all know that these Siachen rivers are the source of clean water, glaciers.
Therefore, the work of clean gardening here means that people can use rivers like Nubra , Shyoke to clean water from here .
My dear countrymen, the festival is a new consciousness in all our lives.
Otherwise Deepavali meaning specially buying some new object , more reduction in the family of the family .
I told you once that we should try to buy locally available things .
If we get important things in our village then for them we do not have to go to Taluka .
Once again I tell you many blessings of this Deepavali festival .
We are a variety of towers for Deepavali .
But sometimes salt gets stuck by carelessness .
My many hustle-bustles .
Blessed are many others .
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Nobody is proud to see our soldiers , our armed forces .
Any species , any place , any religion , or any language is always ready to tell our soldiers , their happiness , Madhuni .
All 125 crore Indians celebrated the occasion and recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016.
Our soldiers were given in the form of surgical strike on our country while fighting against our country , their unparalleled ways .
How much capacity is hidden in us , our soldiers keep protecting their lives by cutting their lives .
Special days like Parakram Parv reminds us of traditional traditions like that of our soldiers in the youth of our country .
We are encouraged to maintain the balance and ethics of our country by Tadwar.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, where the land belongs.
In the two world wars happening in the twentieth century our country soldiers gave clean sacrifices for more than one lakh peace .
With the purpose of running in Shantibat it is a courage of our country soldiers .
India is also one of the largest number of soldiers sent to various peacekeeping teams of the United States.
In the decades our soldiers play an role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet .
My beloved country , the sky is unique .
On the 8th day of October we celebrate the day of air conditioned team .
In 1932 , an extremely small air conditioned team of six stairs , 19 soldiers etc . grew , which was one of the brave and powerful air conditioners of our team in the twenty first century .
In 1965 the enemies of the enemies had also given the pocket of our flight .
Who knows about the independence of Bangladesh done in 1971 .
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from Chorbat in 1999.
On the establishment of enemies in Tiger Hills night and night bombs made them soil .
The support of the archaeological support , seed structure is so much thanksgiving to the country because of the works of the warriors of our air services .
The hustle-bustle of the forests from storm , air , floods is unique in meeting all the opposite opposite opposite nature , in helping the people of the country .
Gender equity in the country i . . in producing equality of women , men they stand as an example .
Now our Air Force has made an alternative to womens Short Service Commission as well as the Permanent Commission and I have made this announcement from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15.
India can now be proud of the strength of women with male power in the armed forces of India.
The powerful woman is now also becoming adventurous .
My beloved country , for some days creatory of our boating team has fighted with death for his life .
How to save him from the country of Javat 
You know that Kada Abhilash Tomi is a very courageous authority .
Without using any modern technique, he was the first Indian to surround the world with the help of a small boat.
To participate in Golden Globe Race in the southern Indian ocean he is moving ahead in the sea for the last eighty days , but the terrible sea storm brought him distress .
But this team of India was spent fighting with many days in the sea .
He is an extremely big example of adventure, consolidation, he added that after a few days he was brought to the ocean and brought back to the ocean, I talked to him in the phone.
My beloved Despair, how important is the second day of October for our country 
This year October is a speciality of both .
From today onwards, we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi through a series of programmes across the world.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have given the inspiration of the world .
In 1941 Gandhi Guru Constructive Programme started writing some thoughts in the form of positive program .
Then in 1945 when freedom fighting in 1945 he prepared the support of his thoughts .
Puja Bapu rails , villages , workers have given their thoughts in front of the people of the country for protection against many things like cleanliness , education .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is a special identity of his personality .
Bapu has understood everyone to understand how important , important opportunity of the country .
Then as thy doubt is being refreshed , thou feels as if thou melt .
This magnificence of my beloved country , the guide of Gandhiji is still special .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , shopping power is increasing .
When we go to buy something then one moment remembers the worshipped Bapu , we remember this mantra once .
Because of shopping these things I give benefit to any pool in the country .
Who has enjoyed happiness in Mughals .
This is his message . I believe that in the life of the poorest , weakest person you can bring a great change in your life .
It is said Gandhiji that my beloved country people , cleanliness will get freedom from cleanliness .
Although he does not know but India has come to India .
For example , in special cases many people have helped the workers by buying Khadi , fishing products .
All these Khadi clothes are also so difficult , but they are not made , they are used each other .
On seeing extremely listening from outside , there were determinations like mountain from inside , Lal Bahadur Shastri .
The ' Jai Jawan Jai Kisan ' is an exhibition of the great personality of the scientific science .
And he gave a mantra to the soldiers of the country , and to the soldiers of the country , and to the soldiers of the country .
My beloved countrymen, it is common to talk about cleanliness while remembering the worshipped Bapu.
September fifteen ' Cleanliness ' started a garden .
Millions of people participated in this programme and I also got the opportunity to pay homage to the children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself founded the foundation of that school .
People of all classes of the country participate in the contribution of this September on fifteenth September .
Come on, let's have a phone call.
Gunnu of your phone call tells you special blessings.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) is one of the worlds most sanitation mantras, experts from all over the world come together and share their experiments and experiences in this Sanitation Convention.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded with the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu on the second day of October, 2018.
Shoot , hypnotise , bored people want to give freedom , peace , justice , it is specially important .
Several chattis have been done for the primary hiccups in the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
Inspired by this, on October 12, 1993, 'National Human Rights Commission' (NHRC) was established.
In a few days NHRC has been completed .
NHRC has not only saved human rights but has also worked to increase our pride.
Prime Minister, our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji clearly stated that human rights are not paradise for us.
In the symbol of our national human hakims the ideal museum of Vaishali is unparalleled .
NHRC has given a very expansive opportunity for human hiccups with which the role of hiccups has also been played to stop the use of these hiccups .
In this journey of feet NHRC has made a belief , one belief environment in the country .
I believe this is a very optimistic event for a healthy society, for the best democracy.
In the national level along with the work of humans in the national level the commission of humans of twenty six countries has also been established .
An attempt has to be made to understand the human rights as a society and to bring them into the jurisdiction this is the basis of the idea of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' - 'development for all'.
In the month of October , in the month of October , the Jayanti of Jai Narayan ji is the Jayanti of Rajmata Vijayraj Scindia .
I will describe them in the Mann Ki Baat but I will surely propose this proposition . In the last few days on October 31st October the ' Rann Fort University ' is being organised in every small and big cities of India .
This time also we make this ' Ran Fort University ' in every small cities , places , villages .
The program called ' Run Fort University ' is the best way to remember Sardar Sahib .
In the society by 31 November 31 ' Ranfar University ' everywhere in the society , all the places of the country we will give strength to all our efforts to kiss the society of the country .
This is the same devotion that we give him .
My beloved countrymen , Navratri , Durga Puja or Vijay Dashmi tell you many congratulations to all of you on the occasion of these sacred festivals .
Thanks.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Yavat India is celebrated with sacred protection festival of India .
This sacred festival is many blessings for all the people of the country .
Situated amidst brothers and sisters this festival of security is a symbol of belief that love is on each other .
This festival also provides a big example of social natural beauty .
The entire atmosphere is filled with elephants , horses , palanquin Shri Krishna Jai , Govind , Govind .
Bhagini Chinmai , Bhavti culture - question .
Friends, on the day of Shravan Purnima, along with Raksha Bandhan, we also celebrate the Sanskrit Language Day.
I would also like to congratulate all the people who have been decorating this great legacy and providing it to the common people.
Every language has its own grandeur .
The ancient language of the world is Tamil language which is a matter of pride for all the people of the country .
It is science , technology , agriculture science , health science , scientific scientific scientific science , gynaecology , management , economy , environment .
People living in Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka state also speak in culture language .
His Jayanti is celebrated daily throughout the country .
It is said that the meditation of coming to all the students of the country has told the ruins of the day of the year .
At the same time science , education , students have been impossible for you .
My beloved countrymen, this rainy season brings many hopes to our farmers to work hard.
The dried trees , plants , dried rivers take the opportunity of dried rivers .
But sometimes this rainy season also brings the floods that give destruction , destruction .
At some places less rains , at some places more than some places rains are natural .
The risks leaving behind them are unfortunate .
But on occurrence of danger humanity meaning what we understand .
We all know that the soldiers of the warriors running in Kerala are the soldiers of the warriors .
They did n't leave anything in protecting those stuck in floods .
But Air Force, not nice, army, but BSF, CISF, RAF, everybody has played a very big role in helping, protective efforts.
I would like to especially mention the hard work done by NDRF and help them in such difficult times.
The efforts made by NDRF to keep their competence, their competence and steady decisions are a matter of concern for every Indian.
Ninnam Festival .
In order to come out quickly from this danger the country , specially Kerala state has given this opportunity to give strength to the state of Kerala , we pray that the resurrection of the state of Kerala is fast .
I believe that all the people of the country are with the people of Kerala , the people of the country , the whole country , the whole country is with them .
My beloved countrymen , this time I see the informations coming for Mann Ki Baat that I have come to know about one thing .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Soni Pat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar etc.
On the sixteenth day of August the world heard the news of the death of Atal dynasty , the country is drowned in the Shokadra of the country .
For the fourteenth year is the chief captain of the country , which hath left the eleventh day .
In one way he went away from the royal palaces of the past .
People have given him the best parlor , easy archaeologically , greatly , beloved leader .
Due to the reason of bringing the public life in the birthplace the country of Atal Giri has fallen .
Our thanks to Atal Ji for the 91st Constitution Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment brought two major changes in the Indian royal palaces .
First change is that in the number of midwives in the states the number of midwives is fifteen percent percent .
Atal guide changed it .
Therefore the vegetation of money became Adada .
Therefore the program has increased .
Due to the point of view of ultrasound these conditions have started increasing healthy traditions in our royal culture .
Atal guide is a true country .
Change has been changed while entering the budget in their administration .
Initially according to the tradition of the British the time of parlor in London used to enter the market in the evening .
In 2001 Atal guru changed the time of five in the evening to eleven in the morning .
In the same way you are watching the churches of the states , central centres once in the country .
It is a good option for delivery .
Healthy democracy , best democracy , providing good traditions , continuously working to strengthen democracy , consciousness , etc . all give us the best devotion to Atal Ji .
The work of Lok Sabha is eighteen percent , the work of the state government has remained seventy four percent .
The Monsoon Session of Parliament reminds us of social justice and development of youth forever.
Several important children have been adopted in these events for the use of youth and backward classes.
The decade of decades like SCT commission is also a desire to choose the commission of Organisation .
In order to ensure the powers of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled its resolve to appoint an Open Commission.
It has also given the power of a state . social judgment which takes ahead .
That is why the parlor of parlor has entered difficult training by entering the parlor .
According to this the iniquities who do illusions not only less training , in twelve girls in the twelve girls are executed .
A few days ago, you might have read in the journals, a judge in Mandshaur, Madhya Pradesh, after only two months of interrogation, sentenced two offenders to death in the case of adultery.
Initially, in a court in Kathani in Madhya Pradesh, after just five days of inquiry, the guilty were executed.
Even in Rajasthan the judges there have taken some such fast decisions .
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness occurring on women , girls .
When we move forward for the country's independence, we can bring about change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the deprived.
In the rainy season everybody has kept an ideal ideal .
I am telling thanks to all the parlors of the country .
My beloved country , these days the eyes of crores of people are on Asia creeds happening in Jakarta .
Asia creeks are even more happening .
I tell all the sports meditations meditation for the country .
If India is fit then India will have a bright future.
I would like to say that in the Asians once again I would like to see the best exhibition of other games as well .
Everyone 's national sports are spectacular in the day of the year .
Besides this the country also remembers him with great pride , spirituality .
In his memory September is celebrated as the fifteenth honey of the engineers .
The engineers of our country running in their steps have published their identity in the world .
It is called 'bhug' in the coach .
This house has seen three earthquakes .
But at some places you will see any harm occurring .
Our ancestors of this house have been built according to the environment here according to the environment here .
It has been said pride that after listening to me what I felt , centuries before that time the engineers of that time , according to the local situations , the normal people living safely were such constructions .
Now when we are celebrating the engineers destination then we should also think about our future .
Keep work shops at every place .
During changing time we learn any new things .
What should be taught to the students 
Then meet .
In the midst of this there are many places rains very well .
At some places maximum rains are also coming to the architects .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of no rains .
Natural opposite to nature is human .
That is why sometimes nature comes on us .
Therefore the responsibility of protecting nature lovers , nature is our responsibility .
Twelve Junior football players in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour .
Normally it takes a few hours to go into that cave , come out .
But the decision of that day is another way .
The way to come out was not found that they were near a small dip inside the cave .
Not in one or two days , but in one or eight days the same way was left .
On one side if they fight with obstruction , on the other hand the human species of the world has exhibited the values of human species .
World worldwide people prayed to take out these children safely .
Those children were stuck where they were in any condition , to know how many possible attempts were made .
How to take out the water if it is not possible to save them in time then it is impossible to bring them out for rainy season .
Unfortunately they have enjoyed everybody in the world as soon as they are safe .
But how this protection program was done all that I considered the other point of view .
The responsibilities found in every level are marvellous .
The government , children , parents , their family members , media , people of the country , everybody has also been observed marvellously .
In this entire behavior one of the Jawans of Dhai Land had also lost their lives .
It is enough to work on our goal with cosmetic , stable mind .
The favorite poet of our country had left us off for a few days .
Our Indians can also inspire the energy of Neeraj Ji every time.
This is the time of the beginning of the art galleries .
The youngsters who come to Jalpai take steps in the most important part of their life where they turn from their point of view to cut-off.
The meditation of students changes from home to hospital .
The students come into the shadow of professor from the shadow of parents .
I believe that my young friends keep enjoying their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
This is the time when you have to become capable of getting out of the house for the first time, going out of the city, separating from a fragile atmosphere.
How many youths come out to give a new direction to their life for the first time .
Everybody has to say that stay calm , spend life , enjoy your mind completely in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , mixing friends , keeping those friends standing so much that it is very knowledgeable .
New experts , new languages learn new languages .
Asram Chaudari of an eminent family of Madhya Pradesh has achieved success by crossing all the difficult competitions of his life.
Jodhpur has conducted victory in the first attempt of MBBS test .
His father used to fulfil his family by doing the work of gathering the garbage .
My beloved country , for a few days creatory attracted a news that two youngsters associated with my point of view .
If we read inside then we try to bring change in the life of a normal person using our youth technology , creatively .
I am discussing with Indian youth once in the city of Sanjoj called Technology Hub in America .
I want them to think about how they can use everybody for India and do something for the country.
Use of their professional experts both of them have made a memorial ypnotise .
Besides connecting the people of that village with the world they have to give any advice , information and information , they have made it available in their own mobile .
In a way, this Yap Village has been trying to bring digital revolution and it is easy to record, track and monitor the development works being carried out in the village.
In this Yap, there are phone directories, news department, awareness programmes, health centres and information centres in the village.
In order to know the FACT ratio among the rural features of the YAP, Market Place will be used for their production.
If you look at this thing very carefully then it is understood that those youngsters are leading their lives in America, in the midst of thoughts and thoughts, even if they leave India, they will also remember the smaller things in their village and understand the challenges.
That is why they can do anything properly in the village .
Located in their village , with their roots this relation , for the country there is a very natural in every Indian .
But sometimes because of time , distant situations , on which a thin dust gets named . but if some small salt is touched then all the internal things come up again .
Pandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
One fifteen , twenty days before Akadashi i . . pilgrims , pilgrimages along with pilgrimages go out on foot for pilgrimage .
This journey is called War . In which lakhs of devotees participate .
Gyaneshwar , Tukaram etc important saints keep the feet in the palanquin , Vithal , Vithal , while dancing , while dancing , walking on foot on foot .
Pilgrims or Vithoba or Pandurang reach there for visiting Vithal Bhagwan .
Vithal Bhagwan protects the lice , bends , victims by doing good .
Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana people have unparalleled faith , devotion .
Going to Vithhoba Temple in Pandarpur, the glory, beauty, spiritual joy is a special experience.
If possible then I want to feel the experience of Pandarpur once .
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ram Das, Tukaram etc. are still imparting training to the common people in Maharashtra.
Their famous folk music Bharud or Abhang we get the message of Sadbhav , love , beauty through them .
Because of this the society of foolish beliefs is available to fight against the society .
The power to see their wrong rulers of the British rulers is in him .
The English Tilk meaning as much as they were afraid , in twenty years he tried to ignore Rajdroh three times .
This is not a small thing .
An interesting incident about a Tilak statue located in Lokmanya Tilak , Ahmedabad is participating with the people of the country .
He said that when Lokmanya Tilak Guru died on 1920 August, 1920, his memorial in Ahmedabad should be dedicated to him.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was counted as the Mary of Ahmedabad city . Venthane his world famous idol Victoria Garden has been selected for the memorial of the world . This garden is known as Britain Maharani .
Finally the idol was built . Sardar Gadh that idol was made with whom the idol was made with the Guru of Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February 1929 .
The most important thing is that in this accident the worshipping Bapu in his progressive council is that after coming to Sardar Patel the idol of Tilk Ji was also possible because of his architecture .
Due to the efforts of Lokman Tilk Giri the tradition of community Ganesh Festival started .
This collective Ganesh Festival has become an effective medium for promoting traditional faith, festivals, social goodness, collectivity, equality among the people.
Our old heritage , history standing in the history of our ancient heritage , these are also known by such a place in our youth .
Today in many cities approximately in every street we see to worship the idols of Ganesh .
Pujas are organized by mixing one team in that street .
This is a unique opportunity for our youth where they can learn the qualities of nervousness, construction etc.
Giving good milk , development fruits every Indian .

Due to the reason of the hilly area this fruit is not available properly .
It has been found that the rails of Kapkot region have found the way to increase the price of selling these fruits directly in the market .
Because of the excess of iron minerals in all these fruits this iron element is very beneficial for pregnant women .
In Munar village all these rails have made a government institute , where the factory made these biscuits open .
The Government has also contributed to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).
Now apart from approximately fifty anganwari centres of Bageshwar district apart from Almora , Kausani is being provided .

It is very interesting to know about the wonders happening in science .
Through artificial intelligence robots , boots , and many other special tasks can be helped in the formation of instruments .
The instruments also increase their own intellegence even more .
This technique is useful for glittering the life of all the lice , baadhis , needed people .

There is no price for them .
Every instrument we want to work only .
But by the instrument we do any work which depends on us .
The goal of human goal is main here .
Science should not only be used for human welfare , but also for stopping the best peaks of human life .

Safety standards are not very important in our country where factories, construction works are being done.
Since the fourth day of March is National Safety Day, the Prime Minister has asked to take some precautions about Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat programme, and to increase the availability of freshness among the people.
In daily life we are not able to take precautions , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get Bhadrata during obstacles .
If concentration falls in them, there is a danger - one destruction causes harm - it ends happiness, laughter - it soon leads to ecstasy and engagement with Bhadrata - do not lose life, do not lose life.
On crossing that way all the times in our life can not be used .
But if you leave natural alternatives , more dangers occur due to our layer .
We are very good, if we take precautions, besides saving our lives, we can also save our society from big dangers.
There are many informations about Bhadrata at the place of working once but nobody participates properly .
I want to make a microscopic drill in front of the children of various schools once in a week with the flame of fire .
This country has faced many natural , man-made dangers and many chemical , industrial accidents.
These are the National Disaster Management Authority, i.e., NDMA, which is manufacturing major seeds in the country.
On occurrence of various types of dangers like earthquake , floods , storms etc . NDMA reaches there only .

Normally we keep traveling in airplanes many times and in the beginning of the flights we are giving information about air hostage Bhadrata .
All these informations are also heard many times .
But if someone takes us to the airways , where is life jacket , how to use it , then I can definitely say that nobody is able to say properly .
There is a chance of seeing them clearly .
That's it.
But we pay attention .
Therefore, while sitting in the air, our ears are heard to be cautious, but we all think that they are doing our best.
We consider every kind of life like that .
We should not consider this Bhadrata not for us .
If all of us are very best for our Bhadrata then the society is also international in it .
My dear countrymen, this time we have started a programme keeping in mind the need to wealth, waste to energy for villages under the Swachh Bharat Mission in the budget.
GOBAR-Dhan meaning Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The gobar-dhan aims not only to clean the villages, to make the name of animals more sensitive, but also to convert them into COMPOST, BIO-GAS.
The number of animals in India is approximately thirty crore and their lice is thirty lakh tonnes .
Some European countries , Chinese animals , remaining in the name of animals , remaining insensitive energy is produced .
But they are not useful in the whole state of India .
The Swachh Bharat Mission is now moving ahead in this direction.
A goal has been set to produce bio-gas based energy from the wastes available from animal lice , sensory vaccine , etc. .
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, rural India has to be encouraged to see the lice and filth of licensing brothers and sisters in rural India only through means of ensuring wealth.
The health of animals shines , their production increases .
Because of bio gas , lighting cosmetic energy increases in the subject of energy .
This technique helps in increasing the customs of rail , animals .
New gardens increase for vegetarian infection , transport , selling , etc .
An online trekking platform is also made for the smooth function of Gobar Dhan which contributes to roses and shopping .
I would like to appeal to the businessmen, especially the brothers and sisters living in rural areas to come forward and enable them to make a synergy and collaborative effort.
I would like to invite you to participate in the mission Clean Energy and Green jobs and ask you to turn the waste into wealth in the villages of Tadwara in the direction of making Gobar-Dhan.

Every year on the eighth day of March the international woman is celebrated .
Many programs are organized in our country , worldwide .

Another such thing has come to my sight that our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have seen an important example.
It is a matter of tribal women i . . in everyone 's mind a certain picture is seen in a jungle , in which the weight of the curtains tied on the head is seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture of the country .
In the Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, Hinsa, Attawada, Bombs, Tupas, Maoists have created a terrible environment there.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this - protection .
During a little time many women meet in it .
Therefore three benefits are being taken , on one side self-confidence has made them healthy .
Leave the unconsciousness in our hands , accept changes in important places .
It is speciality of our society to ready itself .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been found in our heritage .

On the one hand, in our culture, there were natural attempts to nurture the feeling of devotion and debt among the people of the soil, on the other hand, so many scientific methods have become a part of our lives.

If there is some creative object related to cleanliness at one place , then there is a news about changes occurring with some authority at other places .
The expansive report of some days Christian has given me an expansive report in which there is a story of the resurrection of Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra .
There, a NGO Vrindrapur Fort, called the Ecological Protection Organisation, had undertaken a cleanliness drive.
In this program running for two hundred days people did not get tired , not tired , the cleanliness program was run by standing in a hair .
Walking for two hundred days .
Before the program , after that photographs were sent me .
The attempt of this Bhagirathi done for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty , community , for ever .
Forts are our heritage symbols .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe , clean is of all the people of the country .
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Chandrapur for the Eco-protection Organisation.
My beloved country , on the fourth day of November , on the fourth day of November we celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti .
Apart from the first Guru Nanak Guru of the Sikhs , Jagat Guru also .
All the species of T . . have been seen together for their entire human campaign .
Women have given importance to pride , women pride .
Guru Nanak ji had travelled twenty eight thousand kilometres on foot and gave a message about the true humanity of this journey.
They had seen the way of truth , Tanga , Karma Niwas .
It has been said about equality in the society and not only through words but also through its work.
Guru Nanak Guru had also discovered Gurubani to speak his words .
In the year 2019 we are celebrating the 550th light of Guru Nanak Giri .
Come , we try to move ahead on the teaching road of their messages .
My beloved country , after two days we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on 31 October .
We all know that the foundation of modern India is the foundation of India .
With the extraordinary journey of the great child of India we can learn how much .
On 31 October 31 Srimati Indira Gandhi had left this proposal .
He is possible to him in doing counsel .
The palanquins standing on all the sides of India have been guessed by the Sardar Balbhai Patel .
Crores of Indians have decided to bring India under one country , one state .
Their decision has given them the power to face all the obstacles .
Where psychological importance was working with psychological power .
Where there is need of strength there it is possible .
They decided a goal that they were moving ahead with complete artificial artificiality .
This program which can be done by the country .
Everybody has imagined the country like that .
I would like to keep these words inspiring for all of us-- we should not stop the division between the dogs.
This story of Sardar ji is also inspiring and connected to our New India vision.
That is why their Jayanti is celebrated on the occasion of the country .
Their support is unparalleled in giving one egg to the country .
My beloved countrymen , after Deepavali Shells , with a new resolve , you will start again in your daily life .
All the people of my generation want to wish all their dreams , hustle-bustle .
Through the sky you all spent three times while talking to your mind .
These are 36th century in the mind .
I have never said these words in my mind .
And it came to pass , when I had spoken in this mind , that the people of the land were sent unto me , saying ,
There was a lot of inspiration in them .
Many times changes are like bringing changes in the government .
Some personal fibers are like the point of view of some community problems .
Once in a month, I take your time for half an hour but people keep on talking about it in the mind for thirty days in a month.
That is why the journey in this mind of three - three times is the journey of all the people of the country , feelings , feelings .
I am telling thanks to all the people of the country for giving me the opportunity to understand the common feelings of India in such a short time .
Now three three scientists have been completed therefore social scientists , university scientists , media specialists definitely analyze it . good , both are lifted up .
But such poisonous churches are very useful for the mind in future and gives a new enthusiasm .
After that I told me that many social institutions , many social institutions , many youths of the country do such works .
Leaving food in Kanchenjunga , how many people think that how many people have come in my sight , I have a lot of happiness , how much happy .
Once again I saw a surprising selfie with Daughter photograph in Haryana and told everyone about it.
On seeing, not only in one India but in the world itself, a big initiative called 'Selfie with Daughter' was started.
This is not only a subject of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self-confidence in every girl .
Everybody wanted to take selph with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , it has been believed that it has its importance .
I am sitting in the tourism department of India for some days .
It is said that while traveling there people are going to Incredible India -LRB- unparalleled India -RRB- then take photographs there .
Then lacs of pictures coming from the Maru area of India , in a way the tourism industry has remained a very big contribution for all those working in the tourism sector .
I experienced how big a small incident can be lifted up in my mind .
On coming to the thought of the completion of three three times many incidents were glittering in my mind .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Everybody in the country wants to do something or the other for the society , for the society , for the progress of the country .
It has been learnt and heard from the people of the country under the guidance of my three-day Mann Ki Baat.
This is the biggest power of any country , the biggest power of any country .
I worship the heart of all the people of the country .
Once I talk about Khadi in my mind that Khadi is not a cloth but a thought.
Discounts are given in the Khadi girls about 2nd October and a lot of reduction is received.
I want to increase this expensive procedure in such a way that I want to increase it again .
Due to the increase in interest rates, among those working in the Khadi Rang, the Government of India has also increased the enthusiasm of thinking in a new angle.
How to bring new technologies , how to increase the productive power , how to bring in the handicrafts of the powerful force , how to revive the ancient traditions of 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years of ceaselessness etc .
Many people have been produced .
He resumed the training centre of closed Khadi and Village Industries at Penthore, Kashmir, which has a lot of work to do in this regard.
In the beginning of the training centre, I am very happy to give a big corporate institution Deepavali to the new generations to help them build new generations, to do new things.
People also began to choose Khadi things while giving gifts to each other .
Some things naturally moved ahead in the experience of all of us .
My beloved country , in the mind of the month of Christianity we decided to celebrate the cleanliness festival throughout the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti .
Our honorable President Garud started this program .
Children , elders , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been participated in the proposal of this campaign .
As I said that I am able to meditate , we are looking at the front of the eyes as if we move ahead .
Everybody has adopted this procedure , giving its support to support it .
That is why the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery is told .
Along with them every class of the country is also considered to be its own work . Everybody has done this proposal .
They, students, schools, art galleries, universities, railways, coolies, coolies, coolies, children, soldiers, everybody joined this.
If these places are bitter then people are considered unnecessarily unnecessarily unnecessarily then this pressure is also seen in those who work there .
It is very good that more than seventy five lakh people, more than forty thousand people have participated in this programme in the four days of the campaign called Swachhta Hi Seva.
Some consequences are continuously working with the goal of showing results .
Once again we have seen a new thing - taking care of the other side by organising programmes on one side.
If you want to change cleanliness in a natural way , Bhavodavgadh garden is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by cleaning service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have been pictured .
The pictures about cleanliness with their own imagination .
And it came to pass , when the word came to pass , that I will never forget to know the blessedness of the media .
We are watching the cleanliness drive in our country by electronic media, print media and how much service is being provided to the country.
In the midst of this meditation somebody told me about the thirteenth century Billa Dar of Srinagar .
It is said that for the incidents of Srinagar Portuguese this Bill Dar has been made their brand Ambassador . Brand Ambassador i . . Brand Ambassador i . . Hero of Sini Rang .
Not only this .
Billa Dar had payed attention to the cleanliness of his twelve - three years of age .
He is an inspiration for all those who are zealous of cleanliness in age .
Billadar is giving many opinions to Dalhousie .
We have to confess that my favorite country , future history , past history .
This time Nanaji Giridi , Pundit Din Dayalgiri is also the year of the century .
Do not know what is the center of all these great men .
A common thing situated in everyone is that to live for the country , to do something for the country .
Leaving the life of the country of Nanaji , leaving the royal life of the country , it is natural to have the pride of their village program .
The President of India, Shri Abdul Kalan used to talk to the youngsters about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
Like Mahatma Gandhi Gandhi Ji the teacher of Din Dayal meditation also used to talk about the person sitting in the last class of the society .
We should also run for the unity , oneness mantra forward .
The unity in diversity is usually said to be the speciality of India .
We pride the diversity but do you ever try to feel this diversity 
The nearest airport from Deepavali is at a distance of 2 K . . from Thalassery .
It is a common thing to go to every tourist .
However, people don't see our country, they don't know the country's diversity.
Our country is full of many options .
All these Mahabharata have also been developed in the country .
Before starting this work an attempt has been made to understand the country of Bharat .
The attempts to fill India in itself .
My own experience is that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
I got the opportunity to spend night in more than four hundred districts .
I would like to not only reflect the unity in diversity, but also feel that this vast country of India, our unimaginable energy, is full of strength.
One India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power of our country tourism .
My request is that if you want to go out somewhere in your holidays , changes should be understood , understand what should be understood , learn that you should go out with the purpose of learning .
Watch India inside you .
Your life is rich with these experiences .
Your thought is large .
There are more milk for experienced experiences .
Normally from October to March is better for tourism .
Definitely send your photo to the incredible regime.
Send the pictures of humans connected with the place where you go .
Not only the identity of construction , but also come about the life style of the people there besides natural beauty .
Can you keep incredible
You see, I would like to tell the government that everybody from the same state should examine the beauty of the state and make publicity about the seven places that have come in large numbers.
The Government of India works on them .
The government accepts the information of beauty , so many places from you by making pictures , video literature , propagating them at such places .
Come , walk with me .
You can also change a big excitement to use the time of March in the month of October , to encourage the tourism of the country .
I am inviting you .
My beloved country , one man distributes many things like me .
My mind becomes the victim of obstruction .
A deep effect is left on my mind .
No matter how much I am human .
Why does Asaman say that while serving India their husbands are not heaven .
We can imagine how their condition becomes irritable in small age .
With the eleven months she trained her life to make her husband dreams with difficult industry .
Although the husband of Nidhi Dube had forgotten the death by working in the army of Mukhsh Dubey .
His wife also reached the army by reaching in the army .
It is natural for every Indian to have the pride of our maternal power , these varieties .
I am telling many hustle-bustles with the heart of these two sisters .
He gave new inspiration, new excitement to the people of the country.
These two brothers were many opinions .
My beloved country , Navratri festivals , Deepavali festivals have a big opportunity for the youth of our country .
The FIFA Under-17 World Cup is being held in our country.
It is believed that the sounds of football keep refreshing all around .
Every generation the interest of foot balcony is increasing .
There is no youth playing football in any school of India , art gallery playing games .
My beloved country , Navratri festival is celebrated .
The worship of Durgadevi is done .
The environment is sacred , aromatic .
On all four sides spiritual environment , festival , environment full of devotion .
It is considered as the festival of Shakti .
These are also called Sharda Navratri . Till now the calmness starts .
O my beloved country , and worshipped .
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand it is natural to worry about the country when there are positive news from some corner of India.
This is the country of Sardar Patel who offered life for the IIDS of the country of Buddha Bhagwan , Gandhi birthplace .
The ' Ahimsa ' religion ' . We came to hear it while listening to the smaller time .
I had also said from the Red Fort - it was not a traditional belief that it was the belief of the royal philosophy, it was the belief of the royal philosophy, it was the belief of a person, but it was a traditional belief.
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedkar , every person has all kinds of arrangements for judgment .
Anybody who takes the chatti in his hands , he is a person , he is a group , he is not able to bear this country . I believe that no government will be able to bear any government of the country .
Our festivals are also full of many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of thousands of years we have found cultural traditions , social traditions , historical events , everything , therefore in the year one day it will not be drowned with any festival .
All our festivals are also coming according to nature .
All are also directly related to nature .
Jain society is celebrated every year .
Jain society is celebrated in the month of Bhadrapad .
Festival of men is celebrated on the last day of the year .
Actually this is a unique tradition .
Festival is a symbol of forgiveness , non-vegetarian , friends .
My beloved country , today everybody of the country is celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi festival with grandeur .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to come to the matter of Bahraang - Ganesh Festival .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak ji gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago, which was a symbol of freedom struggle before the last 125 years of independence.
After independence they stand symbol of social education , social consciousness .
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated for ten days .
This festival is said to be a symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
The contribution of Ganesh festivals for all the residents of the country is many ruins .
Now Omam festival is celebrated in Kerala .
In the colorful festivals of India the Omnam of Kerala is a major festival .
This festival tells social , cultural heritage .
The festival of Onam presents an important cultural heritage of Kerala .
This festival awakens new enthusiasm, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and harmony in the society.
Now our festivals also change their attraction of tourism .
Navratri Festival in Gujarat, Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become their attraction in a way.
Our other festivals are also useful for attracting foreigners .
In that direction we should think what we can do .
In the tradition of these festivals Id-ul-uha festival is celebrated in a few days .
Many congratulations and best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festival meaning belief is a symbol of faith .
Festivals should be made a symbol of cleanliness in Navbharata country .
This is not new for us but changing it a social habit .
Cleanliness i. e. not only in the house but also in the entire village, in the city, in the state, in our country, cleanliness and cleanliness should be made an important part of the festivals.
My beloved country , modern meanings are changing .
Nowadays, no matter how cultured, no matter how modern your thought process is, everything has become a new quote, a new size, a balance for thousands of barriers.
Therefore in the days of this festival everywhere the soil of the environment has started .
If you look at the room in YouTube, then every household children are making soil colours for it.
Some vegetables are colored , some colorful pieces of paper .
The media houses are also giving inspiration to the people to make the statues of Ganapati idols suitable to the highest environment .
See how big change has come .
Fascinating change.
As I said , our country is full of marvellous thoughts of crores of crores .
It 's a lot of fun if someone has done new discoveries .
Some engineer himself told me , he got some special kinds of soil , mixing it , giving training to the people making soil education .
After worshipping in a small batter the idol melts in water immediately .
Three-three years ago I started the cleanliness drive and the coming October is completed three-three times .
The consequences of this park are seen .
The construction of toilets has reached approximately 67 from 39 .
It is said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahraang was free from excretion .
There have been terrible floods in Gujarat in the middle.
Many people lost their lives .
But after the water of the flood very bad odour spread .
In such a scenario, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind workers at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat were cleaning the flood affected areas of twenty-two rooms and three mosques in a phased manner.
Everybody saved his sweat .
The attempts to make dedication for sports changed into a permanent nature then our country can fly at a height of another .
In one way Deepavali , Navratri , Durga Puja it is considered to be adventurous .
Go to the bus nearby , go to the village nearby , but consider this as a garden .
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation MyGov.

My beloved country , I want to accept all your debts specially .
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you, not to talk to me in my mind, but to join me in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
The number of hearing is in crores but lakhs of people are coming north , messages are being sent , messages are giving me message through phones .
I have become a big opportunity to know the words of all the people of the country .
I will wait for your messages as much as you want to talk in mind .
They come into use for the work of my work .
Once some things get connected to our habits , we also think that we are surprising .
"Prince Garu, I'm talking to Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about my friend.
She is in an attempt to help people but a habit of her own habit has made me tired .
I went to shopping mall once with him.
It has been expensively expensively on one sarasam .
Pizza has kept 450 rupees but shopping mall has made barasaras for five rupees with auto driver .
On the way vegetables were left 4,5 ruptures on one vegetable .
I did not like it .
Not only this , if you go to buy sarasam in Shorum but if someone comes to work with the poor then there is no unconsciousness .
Do ye ever think that what is the cost of the poor 
In your life there is no importance of two rupees , five rupees but your tiny habit can hurt your mind so deeply whenever you think .
My thanks to you, Madam, for telling me through your phone calls about such a heart attack.
My country ' s people also have a habit of producing such a way with their poor , they definitely believe that they will change .
My beloved youth , August 29th honey is celebrated throughout the country on the day of national year .
This is the birthplace of the great hockey sports , hockey magician Major Dhan Chand .
For his service which he hath done for sports is no more .
The reason for remembering this thing is that my desire to get rid of the emotional sports of our country .
Sports need a part of our life .
World Health Organisation has also been seen in the contribution of this youth country .
One type of sports is a big medicine for meeting the mind .
Come forward in the youth of our country . I warned that in the computer of Italy computer there is a lot of importance of playing field .
Play the FIFA in the computer but also show the football in the outer plains.
Cricket plays in the computer but playing cricket under the sky in the open field is different .
At one time the children of the house go out , when they ask .
Now the situation is such that children are also drowned in seeing phono , cartoon films or mobile gam .
Youth friends , Christians have prepared a sports tour centres for glittering , glittering every year .
Wherever the children of all walks of life are present in the entire country, the sporting successes can be uploaded either with bio-to-bio-energy in this portal.
Adventurous games give training to the adventurous games .
This portal has started to morrow .
The happy news of our players is that in India October 68 Vruku , Fefa Ardar 17 world camps started .
These six girls are going to cross the sea by taking a small boat named INS Tarini -LRB- Tarini -RRB- .
The name of this proposal is 'Navika Sagar Parikrama' .
They return to India after a few months or after a lot of months around the world.
The journey of six girls between the waves of the sea is the first incident of the world .
If we see these girls then Indians would not be proud to be proud .
I want to share their experiences with the people of the country .
I will also organise a department for their experiences, apart from reading yourself in the Narendra Modi Yap.
Because I am happy to receive the words of these girls on one such adventurous stories , swimming experiences .
I tell many blessings , many blessings of these girls .
My beloved country , September is celebrated everyday on the fifth day of September .
One student , pundit , one royalist , President of India also considered a study every moment .
It is the main quality of being the most important quality in one study to enjoy creative emotional emotions , knowledge Taluku in his students .
Everybody kiss the five dates with some or the other alternative .
Look at the way to successfully enjoy successfully in life .
Such environment can choose our schools , our art galleries , our students .
If we talk about change in our country , talking about family , then we remember about the society , if we talk about the society .
There is a very big role of meditation in change .
Every student in life because of its natural creation in the attempts to bring changes in each other 's life , sometimes incidents happening at some time .
If we try to contact with us then we can play a very big role in changing the country .
Let us move forward with the mantra of Teach to Transform.
"Prime Minister Garu, my name is Dr.
Annual condition .
I live in the city of Mumbai and the Howard University will work in their Indian Research Centre.
A researcher has a special interest in financial inclusion , on the economic subjects related to it .
My beloved countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, financial inclusion, is a matter of discussion not only for the scholars of the economic world in India but also for the entire world.
On 24th August 28th I started this propagation with a dream of my mind .
Tomorrow, on 28th August, this Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed by three.
The new families of thirty crores of new families with which Jatapancha , Bank Khatas have opened .
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
He has changed his habit , he is going to Bank .
But now due to the convenience atmosphere atmosphere atmosphere atmosphere he also starts working for the needs of children .
It is understood that in the days of coming something good work is done that money works .
The poor now sees his pocket card in his pocket , seeing himself like rich people . If there is crade card in the pocket , then it is satisfied that there is card in my pocket .
It is considered its pride .
Approximately 65 thousand crores of rupees have been included in our lice through the prime minister January .
In one way this is their strength during the days of the coming of the poor .
Those people who are expensive by the prime minister Dhan Yojna , they also got the benefit of Bima .
On the occurrence of obstruction of lice , on the death of the main person in the family they get two lakh rupees in a few days .
Reproductive vaginal irrigation , insulin , rubber card , prime minister mudra meditation , common people have done any benefit .
I will make a complete attempt to reach them .
Due to such inspirations the media can also get complete benefit .
By prasading face of such people new generations can give new inspiration to new generations .
My beloved countrymen , forgive me once again if you are suffering from chicken pox ' - pox .
In rainy season the mind of man is very important .
Animals , birds , goats , nature , everybody turns into excitement due to rainy season .
Due to changing weather changes are happening in the environment and its effect is also very fast .
In the last few days, natural obstacles have to be faced due to observation in Assam , north-eastern regions of India , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal .
My friends of the Ministry are also reaching any place if possible.
The state governments also provide the best help to the afflicted with flood in their own ways .
In such a situation the social institutions , cultural institutions , services of people help them in their own way .
The Government of India is happy to help the Military Jawanese , Air Force , NDRF weekend , at such times to help them with their lives.
The life of floods becomes very unsuccessful .
Fruits , animals , climate , roads , electricity , information etc . are affected .
Especially when our brethren , fruits were destroyed then they were not destroyed , especially the company of insurins companies , specially the climate centres of the fruits , they were very excellent plans .
In order to face the situations of flood the control Room Health Line is working continuously for 24 hours .
People are also telling their difficulties .
Gradually, if we do our work according to the environmental information, we can save us from harms.
When I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat programme, I am going to say that more people of the country are more than me.
I have heard the progress of your Chartered Accountants Day , very impressed .
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into force in our country on the same day last month.
So can you say that in the last months the government had hoped for results or not 
I want to know your thoughts in this matter .
I am very happy and happy when I am getting answers from someone who is getting things cheaper because of GST.
Especially the trade of yoga is increasing on the trade of trade .
I see the impact of GST on transportation and logistics.
How fast changes occurring rapidly , magnificence registration has created a new belief in the country .
Scientists and technologists in the financial system, studying the use of GST in India, must stand in front of the world sometimes as a specimen.
This is a case status of all the university of the world .
Because such a big height , such an important change , with the effort of crores of people in this large country it is a very big task to run it in the country .
Definitely researches on this matter .
All the decisions have been taken concentration by mixing state , central governments .
The consequences of those concentrations are not able to take any kind of weight in lice .
Whatever was the price before the GST, how much is the price in the new situation, you can easily know it through your mobile phones in the GST Yap.
How simple , friendly environment has been created between the government and the businessmen and how important role has been played to enhance the faith between the government and the government .
I would like to share my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries participating in this program, to all the departments, to all the Central and State Governments.
GST is an important example of Indias energy efficiency.
If you want to say one way , this is a social collection .
On the second time I am giving a fort to all the residents of the country like Kotla .
Beloved my country residents , August month i . . option month .
On 1920 August 1 support of support we were listening to the smaller time .
The uit India Movement was launched on 9th August 1942, which is also known as August Visit.
The independence of 1547 August came to the country .
If seen in a way , all the incidents occurring in the month of August are also especially engraved with the history of freedom fight .
Our new generation should know what happened in the 9th honey of August in 1942 .
For the freedom movement from 1857 to 1942, the people of the country were immersed in the freedom movement, which inspired us to build India.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lacs of Indians led their lives through the mantra of 'Doo R D'.
Lakhs of youths stopped their readings , leaving books .
Maha men like Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan played a big role in the garden.
In 1920, the uit India Movement in 1942 shows us two forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1942, the rapid pace of gesture has increased, and a great man like Mahatma Gandhi has also given the mantra of 'Door Day' and behind all this is the people's reputation.
Once I visit India's history, I say that the first freedom struggle of India started in 1857.
Then the beginning of the independence struggle was going on some or the other corner of the country in 1942.
This Surgha period has created an independence in the hearts of the country .
Everybody has become ready to decide something or the other .
This industry , confluence of this industry done in 1857 had reached the last stage of 1942 .
The garden of uit India has changed so much that in 1947 the British had to leave the country in 1947 .
1857 had reached all the people of this freedom movement of 1942 .
Besides this 1942 , 1947 along with the five vertebrae of 1947 , all the people remained positive with one mind , concentration with the concentration of the country this five times has become the reason for the independence of the country .
These five are like a spot .
Now I will meet you with a past .
We came to freedom in 1947 .
Now 2017.
Approximately seventy years were spent .
Governments came .
Providing arrangements have been made , Marai , increasing , increasing .
Everybody has tried to come out in the problems of the country in their own way .
As soon as I had spent the five storeys of 2017 till 2022 were also like adventurous to the contribution of five storeys .
Try to complete them .
For example, from 1942 to 1947, five hundred miles for the country's independence
These five i . . till 2017 i . . till 2022 should be given miles for the future of India as well .
After five years the independence of the country is celebrated .
Therefore all of us should make it a strong alternative .
We should do our contribution year 2017 .
Every Indian, social organisation, local institutions, schools, art galleries, different institutions and everybody is committed to New India.
Come , we are a part of this cultural festival .
Wherever we are, we will definitely be on the online line so I especially urge my young friends and my young friends to come forward to support them in creative ways to build a New India.
Use technology and bring in new ideas like video, posts, blacks, artisans, technologies.
We were massaging this procedure .
We are also inviting uit India uiz for young friends in the NarendraModiApp.
This quiz is useful in connecting the youth with the glorious history of our country and in introducing freedom fighters.
I believe that you will definitely make an expansive proposal of this attempt , spread all directions .
My dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, the Red Fort will have the opportunity to speak to the people of the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
The voice of hundred crores of people reflects from the Red Fort .
An attempt is made to give the form of words to those dreams . In the last three years I should talk about 15 days of August , what should I say about those things , advice is being given .
This time too, I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
In the last three August 15 months I heard that my delivery is taking a long time .
Therefore I decided that this time I will reduce my progress time .
Beloved my country residents , I proposed another thing .
There is a social meaning in the economy of India .
We should never take it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not only enjoyable .
Our festivals , our festivals are also social collections .
But along with this our festival is also directly linked with the economic life of Pauri .
In a few days Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , Vinayak Chatti , after that Chaturdashi , Durga Puja , Deepavali .
Lakhs of families start making Rakhi in small domestic industries before a few months before the economy related to economy .
The people who make Rakhi , Rakhis sell , sweets , thousands of people enjoy the business of everyday with a festival .
The families of our poor brother , sisters were spent because of this .
Not only the festival of lights but also the festival of bringing the glory to the house .
Its relation is directly linked with the families of the poor making small soil .
But I am thinking about these festivals , while talking about the economic arrangement of the poor people lying with those festivals , along with them I also talk about environment .
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are very high , active .
In the last months the best people had written me north for environment .
125 years , 125 crore people of the country .
At the same time we will say that for environment conservation environmental Ganesh i . . soil is worshipped .
I am telling many other beliefs for the festivals of different festivals coming to all the people of the country .
Beloved my country residents , education , economic , social area , playing games , our girls are continuously going to give new goals to the country .
All the people of our country are also proud to see our girls .
Cricket hair of our country has exhibited unique games in the competitions of the world .
In this week I got the opportunity of getting Bhenti with those games .
I enjoyed talking to them very much , but they were not able to spend the world camp .
In their Mughals also this disappointment , tension has been taken .
If the players of India were smitten then we saw many games breaking on them with anger .
If you were not able to wander , then you had spent the hearts of 125 crore people .
I am told by those players that in reality the youth of our country , especially our girls .
Once again I tell my heartfelt congratulations to the youth of the country , especially to our girls .
It is also reminding that 75 years come for our independence to 2022 .
Every country should make a five-pronged way for its contribution .
The beauty of the country , future is the best .
Blessed is the blessedness of all yourself .
It is an experienced vision that we are in a dilemma, we are in a dilemma, we are in a dilemma - whether we are in a dilemma or can lead a livelihood.
Jagannath Rath Yatra is being celebrated in many parts of the country with utmost purity.
This festival is now celebrated in some places of the world .

On the occasion of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath Bhagwani, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all the people of the country.

On this occasion, he decided to construct toilets across the rural areas.

But then our habit does not change.
Similar is the issue of cleanliness.
We have to steadily strive to get rid of such misbehavior.
This incident took place in the Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh .
Its goal is that during an hundred hours the construction of 10 thousand monasteries in Panchayatti .
Beloved my country residents , during hundred hours the government , people together with ten thousand storeys will give you a lot of happiness .
71 villages have changed into villages without excretion .
I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people working in the government, to the government officials, to the Pauri village of Vijaynagar district, who have made an effort to make Bhagirathi an ideal option for others.
Several suggestions have been received from the people of Mann Ki Baat during these days, some suggestions have been received from NarendraModiApp and some other suggestions have been given to MyGov.
Praswamy is not only a system but also a culture .
Reproductive organs continuously need to be aware therefore we should take about the subjects to break the delivery .
First of all the good things related to delivery .

At that time, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also bound in Karagar.
The first month of the month of the first month was very very simple . the first time the Kumbh of India had spent one year on seeing the Kumbh of the Kumbh of India filling with the birds of the world stuck in the handicrafts of the universal birds of the universal birds filled with the birds of the universal birds of the universal birds .

Along with this we should understand that yoga is a unique means for Bhadrata .
"I am talking to Dr. Anil Sonaran from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, the Honble Prime Minister.
I want to give you a question .
Whether we can do it by the country or not .
I had the opportunity to remind the unconscious ovary of the corner .
When I am the main minister of Gujarat then I decided to give books instead of flowers or welcome with hands .
Immediately I started giving those countries to the government .
Gradually this should change a part of our nature .
A flower powder vomits for a while .
Taking it in hand once , leaves again .
I am describing such a store which has historical value .
And it came to pass , when he went to London , that the British queen Elizabeth called me to eat .
The ruins made of hundreds which give me a glimpse of a glimpse in her eyes .
It was said that on the day of his marriage this hand had left the ruins of Mahatma Gandhi , which he gave him in the marriage of his marriage .
It is surprising to keep the beauty of Mahatma Gandhi along with the queen of Elizabeth .
Besides the smaller guide given Mahatma Gandhi guide , she remained a historical thing in her life .
I know that such good habits come to the night .
There is complete transparent transparent .
Government officials must examine the details of the people registered in EGEM.
Because of no medieval things are available .
In this attempt along with India 14 countries like France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Britain , America are also included .

Along with studies youngsters also participate in the programs of games . All these are the Tarsks for the future of their future .
Our sportspersons reached a prideful position in our country with victory and our fame spread all over the world.
Italy was the player of Badminton of our country, Shri Kidambi Srikanth, who disembarked in Indonesia Open.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Shrikanth for this great victory.
In the development of personality sports play a unique role .
Sports are very important in the construction of the person .
There is no dearth of every part of our country .
If you like children in our families then give opportunity to those who want to play in the game .
It is not possible to change book worms by bringing water from the field of sports , binding in the room .

This sacred Ranjan month helps to move forward on the path of peace, unity, harmony.
I tell everyone again .
It has a lot of happiness to give it to many people .
Everybody has encouraged everyone to tell their things .
I could not read all the water , everybody could not listen to me at least .
But I have seen consciously that some attempts to learn music , some try to learn new music , some try to learn new things with the help of Europe , some are trying to learn new languages , to learn new languages .
Some are learning , some dances are learning , some are learning , some poets started writing .
Try to know about nature , live , understanding direction .
I'd like to hear a phone call for you too.
I am talking about Diksha Kaital.
I read all the habits of reading .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about fighting the freedom struggle, I understood that how much sacrifices have to be given to India, how many freedom fighters have spent their years in jails.
How much miraculous ruins were influenced by Bhagt Singh in small age .
Therefore, I would like you to convey your message to the youth about this.
I am very happy to be interested in knowing about the history of our country, about our freedom fighters, about those who laid down their lives for the country.
The great men who were counted had lost their youth in jail .
In the fight of freedom those great men who spent in the jail , reading , writing etc . very big work .
We also know that all of them are very powerful for the independence of India .
Many years ago I went to see the Cellular Jail of Andaman - Nicobar .
The poets used to come on the walls .
He was bound in a small dark room .
How many things have the lovers of freedom experienced 
When I read the book 'Maji Janmathe' of Savarkar, I am interested in seeing the Cellular Jail.
There's also a light sound show, which is very inspiring.
I have said that for the freedom that we have received, people have experienced so many difficulties, if we go to the Cellular Jail, because Kalapani will definitely be known to the youth of the country.
If you are also possible then definitely go to this pilgrimage related to our freedom fight .
Beloved people of my country , June is one Monday in 5 months .
In other words, back to basics.
Nature has to be seen with nature , increasing the beter plant .
Who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi 
Mahatma Gandhi's guide repeatedly said, 'One must care about a world one will not see'.
That is , we should also think about the world , take care of the world .
You will be able to see that when the strength of nature is tired then how freshness comes when a glass of water cools on the pimples .
On getting tired properly opening the windows , opening the doors , fresh air comes new chaitanya .
Therefore we should also give our own attempt to drown with the nature of June .
Our ancestors are now available to us as a result of protecting environment .
It is said that the cause of cleanliness of us is Prithvi .
When Buddha opened Lord Buddha then it is a matter of coming out that the birth of Lord Buddha , his wisdom , his Mahaparinirvana had been done under a tree .
Readers , readers , city residents , tribals , tribals , natural worship , nature lovers are naturally part of their social life .
But we need to contact this thing with modern descriptions , modern thoughts .
In the midst of this I am giving gifts from the states .
That is , in approximately all the states rains start , the program of big plants starts .
Plants are planted in the number of crores .
Yoga exercise is not just exercise .
Keeping in mind the day of yoga in mind two days I came to the north of all the governments of the world , all the governments of the world .
In the year I declared some competitions related to yoga .
Gradually the tasks move forward in that direction .
It's a very interesting advice.
Girl , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , father , son , sons , daughters , one-three generation yogasana should be done by putting those photographs in yogasana .
Today, to morrow, this beautiful yoga offers a new dimension to Yoga and I thank them for giving this advice.
It is a matter of pride that we have gained a very interesting experience through the method of self-interest.
Definitely these three generations wearing yogasana give their photographs to the country , worldwide .
Of three generations they have done yoga , they are doing yogasanas together , definitely send me the photographs of Nrandra Modi Yap , my pocket .
In a way it should be called a positive health care garden .
Since then I have been touring in different parts of India .
While returning I realized that some people are doing very subtle Modi , where are they going .
If this phone call is heard then it is understood that it is Mekda .
Modi Garu , I am often seen in the middle of the social media media that at every place where you go people are taking special care of cleanliness .
On Mumbai , Surat I . . people are adopting the cleanliness of crowds on your newspaper .
The publication of cleanliness that you started from Kashi Ghat has turned into a motive with your inspiration. 'Your words are true.
Wherever I go, the government organises a cleanliness drive but in the midst of this society also cleanliness has become a festival.
Five days before I go, seven days ago, ten days ago, a very high cleanliness drive will take place.
The country knows how much carefully all these things of the country , do not consider this thing , how much joy can you imagine .
I would like to congratulate all those who encourage this cleanliness programme.
Somebody gave me advice .
The advice of truth is very interesting .
I know not whether I can do it or not .
Modi Garu , if you wish for any kind of tourism while deciding your tourism , then what will be your cleanliness level if you want to call me Babu .
The alternative is very good but I should think .
But such a garden should be made . It is a very good thing that by cleaning the garbage of so many tonnes it is very good thing .
By doing this many people are saved from the diseases .
With the help of State Governments, Government of India has decided to launch an important programme on the construction of vandalism with the help of city presidents.
June 5 world environmental day , on the day of the year , approximately 4 thousand cities of the country , liquid form of liquid is available .
Both types of garbage are available . One green colored dobba , other blue colored dobba .
All these work properly in the fields . Keep in mind that the fields are green , what is remembered in the garbage .
The second type of garbage dumps , blankets , iron , glass , plastic , polythene , broken rubber , metal etc . come under various kinds of dry plants which have to be put in the instruments .
In the last few days, you must have heard that Versova Beach has become a clean, beautiful Versova Beach in Mumbai.
Approximately eighty - nine weeks along with the city residents laboured and changed the form of this Versova beach . thousand tonnes of garbage were removed from that place and afterwards it became clean , beautiful .
Its full responsibility was taken by the Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV).

Beloved my country , in the last fifteen months of the last fifteen days , TV Channels , Soshil media , three people are seeing the number of the government .
Three-thirds ago, you gave me the responsibility of 'Pradhan Seva'.
Many symptoms , opinions have been done .
All these procedures I adopt healthy information .
In every test all these three legs have been tested .
Every part of the society has polluted it .
There is an excellent procedure in delivery .
I also tell blessedness to all those who have given special feedback .
On coming to the light of Lotu , Lopalu there is a chance of doing them properly .
The thing is something good , something bad , something bad , learning from it , walk ahead with its evening .
The negative examination strengthens the delivery .
It is important for a very good country , a conscious country .
This is the thing that many families were written to me .
One person , one ordinary Pauri has increased this incident with my enthusiasm .
Even while sitting in such a big place, I would like to congratulate President Giriki, Vice President Giriki and Speaker Ji for giving me so much importance to talk in mind.
In a way, a new approach has been given to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
My friends sometimes talked to me when they were working on the book Manas.
I am debted to Akbar Ji .
Beloved my country , this time the rains of all the countries keep changing .
Come , let us move ahead while loveing nature in this environment .
Blessed is my generation many blessedness , blessedness .
Beloved people of my country , Namaskar .
Probably arrangements , people have become a habit of these problems .
The subjects of children , youths , elderly experiences etc are coming in my sight .
While traveling in the bus , while traveling in the train someone comes , immediately someone comes and gives some advice .
Advice , information is that we are in our nature .
Many people trying to reach me , to give advice are doing something or the other in their life .
With the instrument of something good they change their intelligence , energy , capacity according to the situations .
Some people give advice to their advice at the place of working , the rest of the people who have heard that they have become a support of making a support to everyone .
Not only this when I propose something then it feels very happy to remember such things .
After that many people from all parts of the country like Narendra Modi App , MyGov have said that they have made any creative attempts to see food in vain .
Some videos were also sent to me .
There are roti banks at some places .
May is the establishment of one , Maharashtra , Gujarat states .
This contribution is many ruins of the people of both these states .
Crossing many new development peaks of both the states make an attempt to cross the new development .
In both the states the Mahapuras constantly labour , every kind of society of the society keeps our life sports .
These great men are reminding , on the day of the state independence on the occasion of the state i . . 2022 , all our states , all our society , all our cities , all our families should be included .
Make a plan to ready that contact with the help of all people .
On the second time these two states are my many ruins .
The rapidity of summer staying in the months of May , June in our country has to be felt this time in the months of March , April .
Therefore this time when I advice to talk about mind , more percent advice has been given advice to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also not new but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that Balkani has to keep water for birds , dobapa , birds .
In many families small children also I saw this work .
Once if this work comes in their sight , then birds come and see whether there is water in the cup or not .
We have such a sports but in reality it is a unique experience of stirring up the experience in the minds of Pasi .
Although in our country it is important to give strength to such efforts about animals , nature with nature , but it is important to give strength to such efforts .
When I was the main minister of Gujarat , Danudi Bohra society came to the Guru of Sayadana dynasty .
They lived an hundred three and three .
On the day of his hundredth day the Bohra society of Bohra society has run a very big garden to preserve the pigeons by their Bhurani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
Approximately fifty two thousand Bird Fairs have been sent to all parts of the world .
This has also been recognised in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we were not able to take so much that they were wearing paper , milk , vegetables , Post Man , such that in these summer days somebody drinks good water in the gate .
Youth friends , I want to tell you some things as well .
In our youth many people like to spend life in comfort zones . Sometimes I am obstructed .
Mothers are also reigning their alternative in a negative environment .
Its diversity is also there but most of the comfort zones are seen .
Now tests have been done , to enjoy the cells .
After the summer season the cosmetics become well after the summers .
I want to tell a friend how to spend your summer holidays .
It is believed that someone has been used for sure , it is believed that I have told .
If you do not hear , do not think , do not think , go to unknown place .
Try new places , new experiences , new experiences .
I want that if your interest is in this summer holidays then try to know them .
Give new use .
Use should be positive and you should be able to get out of your comfort zone.
We are of the comfortable families of middle class .
What is the matter of those travellers , what do they do after getting down at the station 
In the evening go to the bus for filling moments with your foot balcony , Wali Bal Tono or some other sports .
Play with those poor children , then look at that game you will get the joy of never enjoying in life .
If you get the opportunity of playing with you in the society then you will know what changes come in their life .
I can say with confidence that if you go once then you will go again .
This experience will teach you a lot .
To reduce technology , borders have come to scatter but its adverse effect has changed how six persons living in one house are also in one room to imagine the distance between them .
Away from technology can you try to spend time with you 
If we pay attention to our country full of many opinions then we get to learn something or the other around us .
If you do not swim , learn swimming , try to give something or the other on the tumor of the best idol .
We felt small tasks that sometimes we are not able to learn some tasks on mind .
You can learn to walk but sometimes you want to learn auto rickshaw .
You can come to wearing a cycle but do you ever try to take people to Trichakra car 
Look , these new attempts , new experts will not only give you happiness , but will also pull your life out in it .
Keep showing Indraja to your friends .
I am talking with my experience , how much possible to learn the world , we can not even imagine .
New places , new cities , new cities , new villages , new villages , new places .
But before going wherever you are going , go to that practice , seeing a memorial there , to know , to ask people , to ask them , to see those places you will have a different joy .
Therefore you will get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends , this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity .
New generations are getting rid of the river nearby .
They do not need the river .
They started believing digital consciousness .
Do you also believe it , but do you ever think that you can gain through this project 
The Government of India has made a plan .
Are you supposed to be downloading the BHIM App

Normally in our country there is a rare environment of Vipe Culture .
Now even if red light has gone on vehicles , the red light entering the brain can not be said hard .
Greetings to the Prime Minister Garu, from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, I will be meeting Shiv Chaube.

It seemed very proud to me .
Now my time is also so important that I am enjoying .
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam.
I want to know the blessedness of my heart for this decision .
The Red Fort is a part of the Red Fort by the government 's decision .
The importance of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country is a New India emotion.
I'm saying IPI in place of VIPs, my impression is clear.
Every person has the primary importance , every person has importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then how big power is to make important dreams , to make important dreams .
Do this work together .
My beloved countrymen, I will never say that our history , our culture , our traditions keep reminding us again and again.

Because of some reason we are not able to take so much that how small is thinking that more than one century is thinking .
Use cosmetics .
It is also so difficult to come out by cutting the society of the society .
How was it that before a thousand years 
Ramajacharyas have done very big fighting against the society , description , unconsciousness , species etc . during their time .
They hungry all those people who take the society by their own jewellery .
Before thousands he got the permission to enter the house , and got the permission to enter the house of all them .
To end the evil of that time society in every age it is our fortune to keep the great men from our society .
Today we are celebrating a thousand years of Jayanti, inspiring him in the effort to enhance social integration.
To morrow the Government of India has released a Tapla Billa in the memory of Swami Ramajayana .
I keep telling the customs of Swami Ramjacharya , I am offering .
Beloved my country , to morrow there is another speciality of Tarikh .
It is celebrated in many places in the world as a day of labour.
It is natural to remember the guide of Babasaheb Ambedkar on the day of the afflicted people , when there is a discussion about the labors , then it is natural to remember the guide of Babasaheb Ambedkar .
Italy I am reminding about Babasaheb Ambedkar , Swami Ramjacharya , the twelfth century of Karnataka , the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society .
In the twelfth century, he had taken deep thoughts about labour and labour.
And he said unto them , Kai Kai Kailas in Kannada Bashan .
It means, 'You can attain the house of Shiva by your industry'.
That is , on doing Karma one gets heaven only .
On the other hand if you want to say , it is difficult to say .
It is natural to remember the guests of Datttang Thangdi while talking about the labors .
Beloved people of my country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapuri .

My dear countrymen, we have always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India.
In India, when there is a 'Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas', it comes not only to India but also to the entire world.
Especially our two countries also come to our country .
Our two countries should be helpful with our two countries , development should take place for them .
Many uses are done .
On 5 May India used the museum of South - Asia .

Beloved people of my country , sunshines are fast , save yourself , save yourself .
Most of the families of the country are standing in their children 's tests .
In the families of those who have been tested the atmosphere of cosmetic atmosphere , tests have a cosmetic atmosphere .
At such a time I can only say one thing, listen to what I had said to the students in Manas for the last time.
In a historical war happening against unrighteousness Bangladesh has achieved victory in the leadership of Bangladesh .
On such a special day I want to go ahead in the development of Bangladesh by telling many brethren independent day of independence to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh .
India will continue to cooperate with you in the direction of your development by protecting the spirit of peace in this Yavat region by working with you as a strong friend and a good friend of Bangladesh.
The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are pride with the pride of giving the heritage of both our countries .
Because Bangladesh is the secret of our Guru Govindranath Tagore .
One interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that Nobel Prize was given to him in 1913 and not only did the British give him the title of Knighthood.
In 1919 when the British created Marahom in Jalianwala Bagh then Rabindranath Tagore is also one .
This incident is the time of showing strong effect on the mind of a twelve children .
In childhood to spend playing this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 the twelve dynasty was the favorite , inspiration of all us , Amarvi Bhagt Singh .
Italy three days creative March , on the 23th day of the month of March , he had climbed the English goddess Sukhdev , Rajguru Lanu .
This incident Bhagt Singh , Sukhdev , Raj Guru , without the fear of three deaths , we all know that the happiness of India has remained .
We can not even keep the story of the life of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Raj Guru .
The British empire was afraid of this three .
They were in the jail while they were in the jail , how was the brush of the British with them .
Therefore everybody had to impart training on 24th honey in the month of March , on March 23th day of March .
Besides this their dead goddesses were thirsty by bringing them to the Punjab region .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time then a kind of imagination occurred in my body .
Whenever I get the opportunity, I am suggesting to the youth of the country to visit Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev , Rajguru and Batkeshwar Datta.
At that time calling for freedom , its acuteness , its quantity increases .
On one side they inspired the youths like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Raj Guru .
Right before the bridges of Italy the first day of 1917 April on the 10th day of April Mahatma Gandhi Champaran .
This is the year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the freedom fight of India Gandhi Wadd , Gandhi Gandhi Gir behavior style first time was known during Champaran .
Specially this incident is a miles in the whole of the journey to fight for freedom from Talluku methods .
The Champaran Satyagraha , Kheda Satyagraha , the Millal Carmik of Ahmedabad , the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi , the behavior style of Talluku are strong in all these .
A man who returned to India in 1915 was only a two-pronged job.
Mahatma Gandhi has shown the magnificent power of the people of the British empire, inspiring to fight, inspire, fighting, fighting, and fighting, and the magnificent power of the British empire.
If we know about Gandhiji at the time of the Champaran Satyal Museum , then it is important to know how much a person starting a normal life .
How to start normal life , how much industry , Gandhi Gurudwara can be learned from him .
We were sent to the village of Gandhi Garhwal at the same time all the big descending down on the ground like Rajendra Babu Garhwal , Acharya Kripalani Giri .
How to learn the color of freedom fighting in the work of people , how to fight it .
A unique balance is in the work style of Gandhiji .
Change is an attempt of an hundred crore people , this is the foundation of new India , India .
There's a desire, a resolve, a enthusiasm.
Beloved my countrymen , if we come out of the life of our cosmetics , see the activities happening in the society with cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetics , if we try to understand what is happening around , then the goals will certainly be able to do something or the other for the society .
It is also like a penance , like a meditation , like a moon service they are doing their work .
Everyday there are many people who serve the patients by going to the hospital .
The meaning of blood donation is everyone running along .

First of all these so many acquaintances you are many acquaintances .
I want to speak in my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness is .
I travel everyday on a river polluting people very garbage .
This river comes to our house on the Rispna bridge .
I recognize it .
I want to be angry with crores of cleanliness in the hearts of hundred crores of people .
Once the anger starts , if there is jealousy , then we apply something or the other cleanliness .
It is very good , active participant , the garden is so important for them .
But cleanliness is always covered with a habit .
I believe that in the November of the country , in childhood , students , in the youth , this feeling is a good result on its own .
We know that we have eaten food in our house , in community food also we keep taking diet in our eyebrows .
It becomes difficult to eat after putting everything in the eyebrow .
Half of them can not be put in the stomach , they come out there .
Do you ever think how harmful we are to leave these swallowing things 
If you do not leave by swallowing it then do you ever think of filling up the belly of all lice 
It is not a matter of understanding .
It is said that in our houses on cooking small children how much food can be eaten .
But it is such a thing that family is also good for family .
They made some mobile yaps.
In every state of our country you will find such people at some places .
Water life also does not leave us flying , how much we can eat , it gives us sports .
See , these are the paths for change .
Those who take care of body , health cautions then keep a little empty in the stomach , keep a little empty in the belly .
Therefore the matter of health is that April 7th Tarikh World Health Organisation .

This time Iueen April 7th Tarikh World Health Organisation has been paid attention to the depression of World Health Organisation .
According to one estimate people are suffering from mental depression on 35 crore people in the world .
The danger is that we also like to talk about this thing as well in those around us .
The person who is a victim of depression also does not talk about it because he also feels ashamed to discuss it .
I would like to tell the people of the country that there is no freedom from depression.
On making a psychological environment it starts getting rid of .
First pill is that instead of suppression x-ray is necessary .
Tell your friends , parents , parents , what will you do with meditations , meditations .
Children residing in the habitat sometimes suffer from loneliness.
The good fortune of our country is that we have a large number of families that have grown in the spitting households so that there is no shape for depression.
They are the first step towards depression .
This is the best alternative .
This depression occurs due to physical , mental diseases .
As diabetes is the root of all kinds of diseases , like depression also does not stand , do not take decisions , do not take decisions , do not take decisions .
There is also another way .
And when ye meet others , when ye do any service , ye shall lighten the weight of your mind easily .

February 15th February is a glorious day in the life of Indians .
Our country has done an important work to lift up our head with pride before the world .
He completed many unparalleled experiments in the ISRO for some time .
The ISRO has established the World Record in the space sector a few days back after successful use of spacecraft, Mars Mission, Mangalyaan etc.
The first country created history by sending 104 museums once in space is India .
It is a subject to enjoy the use of 38th victory over PSL .
This is not only a 'ISRO' but also a historic activity for India.
This space programme, run by ISRO with very low cost, has become a unique event in the world.
The scientists of India have displayed this victory with the large heart of the world .
The main among these 104 museums of brotherhood , this 104 museum of India is Cortost .
How useful are the pictures , wildlife mapping , economic facilities , development plans , city development plans etc .
Especially for my brothers and sisters where the roots of water are there in the country , how should they be used , how important things should be kept in mind that cartosat 2 is helpful for us .
As soon as we go to our toilet some pictures have been sent .
It started its work only .
It is a matter of enjoying that all this program Taluu has been done by our youth scientists , women scientists .
Youth , women , this strong partner of women is a pride in the victory of Isro .
I tell the scientists of Isro scientists to all the people of the country .
For people , for the service of the country , space science for the use of space science they also keep new records for ever .
Our scientists , how many acquaintances we have told us .
Shobhadra had also put another question related to India Bhadrata .
In this matter India has also achieved another important success .
There was no big church about this thing but this special thing has been paid attention to this special thing .
In the protection also India Balstic International Missil has been tested successfully .
This tuberculosis of interception technology has achieved success by recognizing the tuberculosis of enemies nearly 100 km from the ground.
Our Indian scientists have seen this .
Moreover, its strength is that even if there is any tuberculosis to attack India from a distance of 2000 kilometres, our tuberculosis has the power to destroy it in space.
On seeing new technology , we enjoy some scientific new victory .
In the journey of human life Taluku has played a very important role in the journey of development .
Special scientific , everybody does not allow their memory to be like a memories .
That is the reason for new research .
Their questions are not able to sleep .
If we look at the journey of thousands of years of development of human life, then we can say that the journey of development of this human life is not the end.
It is impossible .
Everything , creation rules , human mind keeps on continuously trying to know the mind .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
My dear young ladies and gentlemen, while talking about the hard-working industries of science and scientists, I have often said that in Mann Ki Baat, we have enhanced the attraction of science in our youth.
There is a need of many scientists of the country .
Today scientists become the cause of a permanent change in the life style of coming .
Mahatma Gandhi says they have no science dropped from the skies in a perfect access.
Science should always keep in mind the needs of ordinary people , how can they use their principles naturally , whatever technology is needed , because the common man is the most beneficial .
To identify such creative elements , to exhibit them , to give information to people , how such creative objects are useful for people , how to produce them at a great height , how to use them in a voluntary way , seeing how important work has been done .
I saw this only a fashion .
In 2005 more rains came in Mumbai .
Its meaning is that in the society , in the country , this type of role is very flock of humans .
Our society is also very different directions .
All the behaviors also run in the direction of technology .
In a way, technology has become a different part of our lives.
In the last few days the vagina of digestion is very strong .
Gradually people move ahead towards digital consciousness leaving the river .
Digital Ladwa Devi is also developing very fast in India .
Especially youngsters are habituated to celebrate their digital sisters from their mobile phones .
I am considering this a sign .
Over a few days ago, the people of our country got a massive boost for the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and 'DG-Business Yojana.
Through these two methods, an attempt has been made to convert the river bank in India into a project.
In this plan more than a hundred minerals have been obtained everybody according to lakh rupees .
More than four thousand traders got a gift according to fifty thousand .
Or if I ask these poisonous descriptions that the elderly also participate , then I enjoyed that besides the fifteen years of age there are also sixty five , seventy years old .
Shri Anand Guru from Mysore expressed his happiness that he had received a thousand rupees in the Laki Grahak Yojana at the NarendraModiApp.
And he said , I have found a thousand rupees for a thousand rupees , and I gave her a thousand rupees .
Everybody keeps on telling subjects related to digital .
How enthusiasm things are encouraged , others also encourage .
Puja reading Maharashtra Nundi Piji is also a young friend who uses card , i . . . lanes in his family , how much enjoys it in his family , how much enjoys it with his friends .
It is said that the gift of lakhs is so priceless that he has taken it as a garden and others are also encouraged for this.
In my point of view , everybody related to this work is a new opposite team of this country .
One way you're a clean soldier.
April is a drama of 14 crores of rupees .
There are 40,45 days near it .
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar 
A few days Christian Baba Saheb Ambedkar had taken 125th Jayanti .
Keep in mind that you also teach at least 125 people to load BHIM APP down.
This time give special importance to both Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti , BHIM APP .
Therefore I say that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb .
Going home and mixing everyone in 125 crore hands should be included in BHIM APP.
The effect of this garden happening in the last two three months is that in many times , how successful in many cities , many cities .
Beloved my country , the economy of our country is a big pillar of agriculture .
The economic strength of the villages , the economy of the country gives strength to the economy .
I want to tell you a pleasant thing .
Our brother , brothers , sisters filled our grains with so much trouble .
This seventh year in our country corn has been produced in the record level with rail labor .
All the signals say that our rail records were bound all the old records .
This time how is the fruits in the fields , everyday Pongal , Baisakhi festivals are celebrated everyday .
This year about two thousand seven thousand tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country .
This time 8  more than the emotional record of our rails is emotional .
This is the success of flying so much .
I am specially impressed the rails of the country .
Because besides traditional fruits they were able to pay attention to poor people , various types of pulses were cooled because the poor get the most protein with pulses .
Keeping in mind the need of rails in the country I enjoyed the fruits of various types of pulses in the land near two hundred ninety lakh hectares .
This is not only the production of various types of pulses , but also an important service for the poor people of my country .
My prayer , my brethren , my country ' s rails have produced a record of pulses , and have produced a record of pulses . Therefore my brothers and sisters have special discoveries .
My beloved countrymen, in our country some work is being done in the direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the society.
In a way everybody seems to be very behavior related to cleanliness in some form .
The government is also constantly trying .
Six houses toilet pits were empty , they were healed .
The Twin Pit toilets were empty , then the rulers themselves saw the methods of using the toilets again .
How do we clean other cleanlinesss , these toilets can also be cleaned like this .
Because when an ice authority cleanses the toilets themselves then it is natural to attract the attention of the people of the country .
It has also been proved .
Six members of the family are filled in five stard tower .
After that the garbage can be easily turned into another pit.
In six to twelve months the garbage reached in the toilet goat gets completely rotten .
The government takes this in front of the government , others also use such before .
Clean bird festivals are continuously going on in various parts of the government .
In the first part of the month of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, is also organizing this Swachhta programme.
We welcomed the exhibition of our Divyang sportspersons in Rio Paralympics.
This glorious work of Divang friends is proud .
Always learn from them that there is something or the other .
The matter related to cream , space related to space women of our country do not take anyone .
While stepping they are moving ahead . They are increasing the country with their victory .
Women sportspersons of our country participated in the Asia Rabby Sevens Trophy during the interaction.
My heartiest greetings to all of them.
On 8th March the whole world also celebrates the day of women throughout the world .
Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao programme is progressing rapidly.
These are not just a government program .
It has become a social chapter, a public education programme.
In the past two these programs attracted the minds of common people .
This problem occurring in various parts of the country thinks that people of the country have changed in the thoughts of behaviors coming to the people of the country .
As soon as the girls were born , how much enjoys on knowing the news that they are celebrating .
In a way the society of increasing girls is the reason of their social independence .
The nearest airport from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is Karipur International Airport .
Not only this on approximately 175 marriages can be stopped .
Under the Sukanya Samruddhi Yojana, the District Milk Department has opened bank accounts of about 55-60 thousand girls.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana (BBPY) was launched by the Convergence Model in the Kadhuwa district of Jammu and Kashmir and efforts are being made to ensure that under-privileged girls are taken up by the Department of Rural Development and their education facilities.

In Rajasthan, a programme called Apna Bachao, Apna Vidyalaya is being organized to re-read the girls who have gone to the school.
It is said that Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana has also transformed into a lot of forms.
The entire garden has become a resource.
New thoughts are drowned with it .
They are changing them according to the needs of the province .
My dear countrymen, sometimes I get the opportunity to talk to you all through Mansukh Baat programme.
You are also taking care of yourself .

Man Ki Bath , August 2019 .
Today our country is enjoying rains on one side .
On the other hand in the roots of Hindustan some festival , fair , Deepavali all are held .
Perhaps our ancestors , in any situation in the society of the society of the society , economic wheels have been imagined .
Till now we have celebrated many festivals .
The birth of Shri Krishna Festival happened in the whole of Hindustan .
The cost of such personality is that even after spending thousands of years every festival brings a new dimension , it gives new energy , someone can imagine new energy .
Today I talk to you about two important moments .
One Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan , one Charkhadhari .
And when Sudarshan Chakradhar had left the bank of the Yamuna , and went to the sea shore of Gujarat , and was established in Dwarkanagar , then Mohan came to the bank of the sea shore , and spent the ends of life in Delhi .
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had used his intelligence , to stop the war , to stop the war , to stop his intelligence , his intelligence , his scientific worry .
At the same time, India is in the process of a big festival.
Not only India , but the whole world is this church . my beloved country .
I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served the rails being identified in Champaran .
To remove many illusions related to blood pressure they themselves have served the patients of blood pressure .
Through service itself has kept its life example .
We can understand this thing directly from the life of Bapuji .
The person , society , humans , humans were specially this .
Finix Farma of African , Tal Stay Farma , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardhana , all the places of the society , committee Mobilization were dedicated to them in a special way .
We need to bring all these emotions in our behavioral life of society , society , community community community community community .
It is true that this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi , true work .
We will think that in the society connected with people , with all classes , with all ages , the city is a man of all ages , or the society with everyone , what can I do in my attempt .
What is the cost of my waves that is good .
Community is our strength .
In the programs happening in the year 150 AD there is no community , service .
Our woman is Mandali Ladys Club .
I'll do the work of Lady's Club in the modern age, but let's all join the Lady's Club together to do some service.
You can do a lot.
The scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific 
There is no point in mind that if you can serve with good wishes, goodness and goodwill with a complete sense of compassion then it is enough.
It is also comfortable if it is for a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
It is a very important factor in the freedom struggle.
I participated in the opening year of a modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
By this other people also write three - four words by expressing your emotions with those photographs .
During the time of coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been done .
But in this context one interesting thing is to participate with you .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time an interesting exhibition was organized in the Indian building of Venice Biennale with Gandhi memorials.
In this Haripura Panels are specially interesting .
In Haripura of Gujarat the confluence of Kangras is celebrated , in which the history of Subhash Chandrabus is remembered .
This is a beautiful past for Art Panel.
Prior to the Haripura Sabha of Kangras, in 1937-38, Principal Nandlal Bose, the penny of Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kalabhavan was invited.
Gandhiji acknowledged the exhibition of his artwork in this meeting to showcase his lifestyle in India through art.
The art work which exhibits our state is Nandal Bos .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
This Bos Gir artists have embraced his own emperor along with the state of art gallery .
Tourists from nearby villages of Nandal Bos Haripura , in the end rural life of India a art canvas has been prepared .
This invaluable artefact was discussed in Venice.
I would like to convey my best wishes to Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary.
Do something or the other for the country , society .
The same will be Bapu's right, true and honest action.
This time it starts from 11 September .
At this time, we will dedicate ourselves to Mahatma Gandhi by coming out of our homes.
The house , street , but the rooms are Gony , but the art gallery should be organised in all the public places .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
While talking from August 155 fort , how excitement , enthusiasm , energy , I said that in Bahraang places free from excretion has been done .
We're all gonna stop Single Use Plastic's association.
In this context, all sections of the society are excited.
Through this money is saved, it plays an important role in environmental protection.
This time in the context of celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of October Bapuji, he dedicated the India released from excretion to excretion and also laid the foundation of plastic opposite park.
I am giving a gift to all the classes of the society , every village , every city residents .
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated to free India from plastic garbage .
All the Municipality , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , private arrangements , all the institutions , everybody has to say that there should be adequate arrangement for plastic roof .
I am urging all corporate sectors to examine the issue of disposal of plastic waste in one place.
It can be rescilled .
It can be fuel .
Today I want to say a very important thing with a culture.
There is a lot of importance of food in our culture .
As much as we were also included in science .
In the Nutrition Abhiyan, the entire country is nurturing modern scientific methods.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting ways .
Once the matter came into my point of view .
In Nasik, there was a big initiative called Fidded Corn.
In it on the days of harvest anganbari services of anganbari are administered one rice from the people .
Women , children are made to make this grain hot food .
In this the person donating donating is becoming the servant of a Jagruk society .
This culture is celebrated during feeding the first time to the children .
Liquid diet is not honourable .
Saurashtra had taken a thought in 2010 that why should not it be necessary to provide complementary food to the children in the context of food processing
This is very important , which can be participated everybody .
In many states people eat guest houses .
A unique function of service , happiness is spectacular .
O sisters , by many small methods our country can be influenced by fighting with malnutrition .
Today the right information or poor , wealthy people are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated as Nutrition Abhiyan throughout the country.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I felt very sure that there would be a lot of questions about this.
For the past few weeks, wherever I went, I met people, there was a proposal about Man Vs Wild.
I have not imagined that the opportunity of refreshing the youth of the world has come in my life .
But what happens .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As the Prime Minister, whenever I come to visit, I am going to talk about one thing - International Yoga Diwas has made a contact with anyone in the world and someone talks to me about Yoga for five to five minutes.
I am talking about Yoga in the world's biggest leadership, I am talking about the whole world.
Discovery Channel has planned to publish this program in 165 countries in their language .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate Jasts , clean environment in our country .
But another interesting thing is that some are asking me a word , Modi , you are talking in Hindi , Bear Grylls do not have Hindi .
After this do the cost of adventure .
Then what happened to the cost of shooting again .
It is questioned very carefully .
See , there is no secret in it .
Many people have this question in their minds. Okay, I tell you this secret now.
Actually this is not secret .
In fact, technology has been fully utilized in the conference with Bear Grylls.
Bear Grylls has put a small card lease in the ears as I said something which was done in a smooth manner in English.
Therefore if I talk in Hindi then because of listening to him in English the conference of technology is very simple .
After this show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to places of nature , wildlife , living .
What's the nature
You will stay on seeing .
Your interference is also enlarged .
On 15th August, I made a request to you that at least 15 places in the next three days, 15 places in India are completely tourist centres.
You go, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought is enlarged .
My beloved countrymen , in India the thought of environment protection , conservation meaning conservation is seen easily .
In the last month I was spectacular to release the population of the country .
Do you know how many tigers in India 
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred sixty seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the branches .
In 2010, a thrilling meeting was held at St. Petersburg in Russia about tigers.
In this information about reducing the number of tigers has been taken .
2022 calculla is the contribution of double the number of tigers in the world .
But now this new India will complete the goals soon .
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 .
The number of tiger reserves has also increased not only in India but also in the number of wildlife reserves .
While releasing the tiger tail I also recognized the lions of Gujarat .
When I responsiblely responsible there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was decreasing .
We have taken several steps in Gir.
In 2007 the decision of making women guards there .
We will facilitate infrastructural facilities to increase tourism.
When we talk about natural , wild animals then preservation is discussed .
But along with protection one should think about taking this church towards Karna .
Therefore it is not necessary to save forests , trees , wild animals , they should also give appropriate environment to increase properly .
My dear countrymen, how can we forget Swami Vivekananda's historical address in September 11, 1893
My dear countrymen, you will be reminded that we celebrate August 29 as the National Celebrations Day.
In this context, we are launching Fit India Movement across our country.
Keep yourself fit and make the country fit.

This is the only plastic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic .
To get rid of plastic we should take along all the places of house , household , household .
I know about this thing that in Soshil media I will run .
Come , let us move ahead with a new alternative , new energy .
I'll wait for your words, for your suggestions.
Come, let us move ahead with the dreams of our freedom fighters, the dreams of India, the dreams of Gandhi.
Man Kei Bath - speaking in the mind .
O my beloved country , worship .

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and India on Cooperation in the field of Traditional Systems of Medicine.
But now the responsibilities of people in our country , how deep they have to discuss that it does not happen so much .
To morrow 30 our worshipped Bapuji is the pilgrimage of Bapuji .
On 30 January 30 in the morning at eleven o'clock in the morning we pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country .
It is a natural way of society , country and country .
Two minutes also pay attention to simple , cultural , martyrs in it .
In our country, there is a natural example of army, security forces.
I congratulate all the members of their family members who were honored with various books in the morning .
In these books there are many types of Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , traditional service , special service etc .
If we understand their virtue , adventurous activities properly then we get inspiration along with pride .
On 26th January, while on one side with glorious enthusiasm and enthusiasm, our troops were in Kashmir for the protection of the country.
I am giving the devotion of all these virgins to the adventurous faith of all these Jawans .
My young friends , all of you know very well , I keep talking continuously in my mind .
January , February , March , April all the months of April are the time of examination in every family .
There are two children in the house , there is a test on everyone in the house .
I thought that this is the right time to talk with their students , to talk with their teachers , because I went somewhere , whose tests were found to be a big problem .
Everybody gets to see family , students , students , everybody gets to see a big psychological environment in every house .
Seeing them I want to participate the thought that came in my mind .
I came to the message of a telephone from creation .
Listen , what is the creation of creation , I want to tell you what I want to say to you , during the tests , in our house , in our society a terrible environment in our society .
Due to this reason students are encouraged by the inspiration .
People who enjoy enjoy pleasant benefits .
That is why my goal is like a festival . tests are considered to be a festival .
On the occasion of festival , festival the best alternative comes out in us .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
What is the best .
Festival air test is removed .
That is why I have told all the parents that you change all these three months adventurous environment .
The truth is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir Varka , from Kutch to Kamrup Varka , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh these three-four months are tested .
Therefore I call you all ' Smile Mor , Scor Mor ' .
If you are stressed then all the doors are closed . outside the matter does not go inside , it does not come out .
You do not even tell anyone .
Why did you remember that you had come out of the pressure .
Therefore , what important medicine is to increase memory , it is relax .
I have to say through my own experience that if we are pressed then we forget our things but when relaxed then how much work can be remembered .
Therefore, A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.

I would like to convene a meeting with all the Chief Ministers of the States, but I would not like to do so.
I conveyed my heartfelt condolences to every state and spent about two and a half hours in each state.
I have listened carefully to every state.
Normally, such discussions have enhanced the number of subscribers that the Central Government has made, no matter how much money every state has spent.
On seeing this, the Union Government officials were surprised to know that some States have made remarkable efforts to address water, environment, malnutrition, and to take care of the vulnerable animals and the vulnerable human beings.
I assure them that NITI Aayog should exercise the best practices in all the States.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have fully utilized technology.

Peoples participation is a strong foundation for addressing such issues.
We pray for God's forgiveness five times, along with taking it along.
Water is also a goddess .

There is a need to implement more pulses with every drop of water by adopting micro-irrigated methods.

It is not a mantra, it is ours.
It is our responsibility that the media and media have explained in detail about the oxygen of water in the past.
These mediums also seek to pave the way for water conservation, enable people to take part in the mission mobilization and water scarcity.
I also welcome those mediums.
Let us change our old habits a little.
My thoughts are with you that if you help me in that matter, we will not be able to fulfil our development in that direction.
Sometimes there were no coins or no mouths.
If you want salt, you should give vegetables.
The world is running towards a non-cash system.
We can take and deliver pills through electronic technology.

This will be very difficult in the first place.
But if it becomes a habit slowly then this system will become easier.
Approximately all the families of the country have opened the bank accounts on the occasion of 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana' that we have entered into.

There is no need to deceive the diabetes.
The second one we have launched will transform the Bank on Mobile - Universal Payment Interface Banking Transactions (UPI) system.

In case of an e-mail in the site, my vision has moved towards it.
He placed his presentation before me as the Guardian Patel of the Middle East.
It seems to be a burden on my mind.
You had thought of achieving greater development in the past.
I want all of you to confess that when your children bring the results home, please give them happiness and convey their best wishes.
Encourage them to grow further, if not, they have brought 100 per hundred.
If anything else is done then it will be better that day too
The challenges surrounding me are not recognised.
These lines are not properly remembered.
But what came that poet - I felt my pain on the embankment of life.
Keeping that picture in view, the water seeing it should be lightened, instead of blue color, it would have been better if it was brick and brick and it would have been better.
The pain that has been painted in this picture is not understood, but more people who say that it has to be lightened.
However, if you do not rejoice at the outcome, you will never be able to make new constructions.
Sancha will be happy and helpful in achieving this goal.
It continues to be faced in life.
You must have heard about the music of Santoor.
Sometimes it was merely a musical instrument in the Kashmir Valley.

That is, they have decided to abstain from being imprisoned and banana.

Anybody can imagine the responsibilities of using such water for the owners of a large quantity of water and shutting down their units.
But see the discovery of the brothers of this rail .

I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of such villages for their good work.
I am told that the Gorwa village is Panchayati in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.

Clean drinking water also causes increase in GDP.
However, many people around us are making every kind of effort to face the neglect, we will be surprised to know how new methods are being adopted to solve them.
Why shouldn't we take the soil out of the ponds and throw it into the ground
The field is also well developed and the ability to accumulate water to the field is also increasing.
Sometimes, in cement bags, sometimes in empty bags of red bags, soil can be filled with stoppages by stopping them from getting wasted.
Shri Kumar Krishna, in his MyGov, also expressed a sense of curiosity.

This fort is not a family associated with it.
It is also very light to leave subsidies above .
Mobile phones can be used by yap.
Online payment of Missed Collection for telephone number can also be waived.
I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of those forts.
Scientists in our country also thought differently.
We should move forward in this direction.

However, it has been a benefit that if you look at the descriptions you are writing then I would like to know the details of several books.
It seems that we need to take it forward with the experience of these months.

I would like to tell you about these things that you will be proud of.
We all know how scared the whole world will be by listening to cancer.
It was noted that these ten children were waiting in the dilapidated gates, and they brought the name of India to the whole world by defeating cancer and such serious diseases in fighting their lives.
We must have seen a Championship just after winning a sportsperson's tournament.
However, in this rare event, the Champions do not participate in the game competition.
Champions in fighting their lives.
These include competitions like shooting, swimming, swimming, football and table tennis.
These ten champions of our countrymen have won medals in this tournament.
Some have also received more than one medal.
From Jodhpur, Rajasthan to Haripura, Kolkata to Mahendrakumar, Telangana to P.
In fact, 2019 can be said to be a very good thing for India.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat Launch in March.
In other words, the A-Sat Missile Cave has the potential to eliminate a 3-meter long satellite within three minutes.
India has emerged as the fourth country in the world.
Now, on the 22nd of July, the entire country has taken pride in the length and breadth of Chandrayaan-2 from Sriharikota to the interior.
Photos of Chandrayaan 2 launch have enjoyed pride, enthusiasm and happiness for the people of the country.
We must believe in our ability.
We will wait for the month of September to be the Lander Vikram and the Rover Pragya Sangathan on the lines of Chandrani.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share my thoughts with my friends and young friends of the country about a competing competition and competition.
I invite youngsters from across the country - a quiz competition.
Space mission of India, science and technology is a key issue of this quiz competition.
I would like to invite young friends and students to participate in this uiz Competition and make it rational and rational.
I appeal to schools, enthusiastic teachers, teachers and guardians to make every effort to make our schools successful.
They will have the potential to see the tune of Chandrayaan Chandra in September.
This victory will be a historic event for the students who have won.
But we do not forget to participate in the quiz.
We inspire more and more people to participate.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat moved ahead after asking all the cleanliness drives.
And all the efforts being made for cleanliness have inspired Mann Ki Baat.
Beginning five years ago, this journey will reach a new milestone of cleanliness in collaboration with all the people.
We will not reach the vision of Swachhata, but the sanitation that has been achieved from the ODF to the public place is about 130 crore countrymen.
But we don't stop here.
This mission will enable cleanliness to be smooth.
A few days ago, in the media, Shriman Yogesh Saini, his family and his stories were seen.
Yogesh Saini Engineer, who left his job in America, returned to serve mother India.
He underlined the efforts not only to make Delhi clean, but also to make it beautiful.
He also flagged off from his team and Lothy Gardens furiously.
Through the street arts, many places in Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
The initiative will not only help people to generate Over Bridge, slum huts, but will also help people to generate beauty through their crafts.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings in the Kumbh.
This will also bring us to the fore in the beauty of Swachhata.
This is an explanation written by Mahmad Aslam Bhai of Shopia, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote that it would be better to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to say that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobilization Programme Back to Village in our State of Jammu and Kashmir.
Besides, there should be an online monitoring system on this programme.
Government officials in about four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state and all government officials have been briefed about the government's plans and programmes and whether these government services reach them or not
How can we further enhance the efficiency of Panchayats
How to increase their income
Literacy, sex ratio, health, hygiene, water conservation, electricity, water, girls education, old age pension.
Khelo India Sports Competition was organised in Khelo India.
Sports Kits, Job Cards of Man Raga, SC and ST certificates were distributed there.
Financial Literacy camps have been set up.
The people of Kashmir have participated in this festival of development at a great height.
If we look around us in this situation, the earth will look like a green garment.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan will also be celebrated on the occasion of the festival of Raksha Bandhan for the love of Sodari brothers.
It will be a pleasure to hear another thing when it comes to Shravana month and this time more than four-year-old devotees have gone below the Amarnath Yatra.
More than three lakh pilgrims visited the Pavitra Amranath cave from 1st July till now.
More than 60 participants participated in the journey in 2015, this time in 28 days.
I will highlight the hospitality and hospitality of the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the context of the success of Amarnath Yatra.
I know that more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham this time in Uttrakhand.
For the first time since the terrible disaster in 2013, the number of pilgrims has reached such a record level.
My request to all of you is that you should go to those places where there is a beauty in the country during the rainy season.
To see these beauty in our country, nobody can have a tourist visit to know the souls of the people of our country.
There is a lot of hardship in other parts of the country.
Today the Christians of the world are celebrating this festival .
This is my ruins of everybody .
My young friends .
Testing on one side and T20 cricket world cup matches on the other side.
I know that in the evening also you are waiting for India - Australia match for sure .
Below some days India has spent two straight matches with Pakistan , Bangladesh water .
We are seeing a good zeal in this T20 Cricket World Cup.
Today, India and Australia are ready to play jointly, these are my best wishes for these two waters.
65 percent of the population of our country is not seen any reason for staying away from participating in the world .
This is not the work done .
It is necessary to bring opposite changes in sports .
We can see this place in India .
Like cricket now there is an interest in football , hockey , tennis , cabbage .
You will be aware that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in the coming year.
Our country has come to play twenty four water from all over the world .
In 1951 , 1962 in Asian Games the Indian football of Indian football had spent gold in 1956 and in 1956 Olympic Games the hair of India stood at fourth place .
Unfortunately some decades we slipped from there .
I don't even want to tell you about our rankings in the FIFA.
On the other hand, I am going to continue to grow so much in the youth of India that it is English Premiere Leg or Leg or Indian Super Leg Match.
Indian youth are giving time to know about these matches or to look at them in television.
I have said that when the recognition of these games increases so much then we will not only fulfil our responsibility by playing an important role when we get the opportunity to host the FIFA-17 World Cup.
Or do we encourage sports by using this opportunity as profitable for us
Football, Football, Football, We should create the changing environment this year - in schools, arts and in arts, in every corner of India.
In our youth , our children should kiss with sweat while playing football .
It has been done that for giving guests we get the pleasure of civilization .
Therefore we should try to take the beauty of football village , street in the street .
From today onwards, the FIFA under-17 World Cup in 2017 will provide a new impetus to youth.
It is good to give guests to this program that many mythological games are organised here .
If we are able to make every youth of our country with this game .
How can we enhance the youth of India through the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup
How to give comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensiveness in the government , educational institutions , social institutions .
We are seeing all this in cricket
We should also try to describe these parlors to other games .
I believe that there is a need to recognise Indias youthful capabilities as a world that does not mean that a match is not known as Gelichama or Odama.
2017 AFA-17 can be exhibited by combining our capabilities with the World Cup.
In doing so, we can also do the branding that will enhance India's dignity.
You can send me your suggestions and suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup through the NarendraModiApp
How to have songs .
What should be there in the sovereigns 
Think of friends .

You should participate a big height in this program .
This is a golden opportunity to make India harmful .
You will think of going somewhere in my favorite students , holidays .
There are very few people going to the country and abroad .
We should take this work further .
This time also do this work .
And it came to pass , when the journey was not discovered , that he said , Who is like a bird without wings 
If you really have interest in seeing , then you should also prepare an international point of view of seeing them .
The journey plays an important role in correcting life .
Now the journey in the youth of India is increasing in the youth , gynaecology .
In the days before they did not go on the way to go everybody , on the way ready .
They want to do something new
If we see the pictures of the workers there , then how will we go there 
But for this coal tourism the Western Coal Falls Limited has been shown .
Near the Sawaner village near Nagpur the Eco French tourism site has been described above 10,000 people till now .
If you want to see any new thing then this is our opportunity .

In scientific method this attempt is not possible but work is done .
But if we want to make the tourism of 125 crore people of the country then we can attract the world .
We can make a big part of the world tourism .
Otherwise our crore youth can show the opportunity of the youth .
Government Gony , institutions , society , society , people do the work of meeting it with the beauty of the Government .
Come , in this direction we make an attempt .
Beloved my young friends , holidays I do not like to make some vain for the city .

Ratu waits for rain .
But if there is no water then all our country residents also think about what happens .
During this time we stop flowing water in our ponds , places flowing in our area , water reaching in the ponds , reaching there , or due to the construction of dust , the water stops flowing there .
In the past after cleaning the places of water , places , places and cleaning the garbage we can prepare even more water after reaching the water .
Full of ponds . Our rivers , canals are full of ponds , after that there is no deficiency of water which does not cause much damage to us .
But it is possible if we hold the leopard of every rain water by sticking it in the lap of the water .
This time we were able to excavate five lakh water drops .
Although in this direction how much effort is needed to take place .
Beloved my beloved brother , brother , sister of Italy Government has played a heavy rail service of India .
Everybody should be in balance .
That is why the expense of less money remains .
Our sympathy is that the expense is reduced to higher yields.
This very mantra should be celebrated , according to our behavior we should increase in scientific methods in our agriculture .
This year, the event is being organised with the vision of 'Bit Diabetes' all over the world.

It has been seen because of diabetes in three percent deaths .
In diabetes two types of type . . . .
Type-1 genetic comes .
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes .

How to do this program .
The FIFA program provides a special opportunity to do this .
They have done photographs of such magnificent places that seeing them really enjoys .
I consider it a good sign .
Wherever there is no leg , you like to bear feet there .
This contribution is considered to be the special opinion of India .
In comparison to the countries of the world India is very behind the tourism sector of India .
You also think like this .
I'll tell you a thing to think.
Look - you will have happiness .
I am expecting you to say this again in Mann Ki Baat.
If you want to say the truth , I forgot its identity .
You have enjoyed this thing with me .
For the preservation of water we should take these churches with complete care .
Many other diseases of our body are entered into our house as guests of our body .
You must think about this thing .
It is said that for getting the babul test the vaccine is coming .
It is said that he had come to TBB .
Its meaning is that this disease can also be tested very fast .
But you do not think that this work is not because of the government , doctors , medicines , therefore the people of the country are my support .
Therefore , in your mind also it remains shining .
I also want to meet you in this journey.
No matter how much you are in the matter of your children 's test , it is the same .
But if we change our thought about the tests , perhaps we will get rid of this campaign .
I have said so much in Mann Ki Baat that your experiences and information must not be sent through the NarendraModiApp.
Today, I would like to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers in my Mann Ki Baat.
I know that tests start in a few days .
Everybody asks how is ready to test .
How many times come , how much do I scorpion , I told one another .
You decide yourself a goal for you .
While playing cricket they were many estimations on me , how much hoped from me .
The estimation of some time was even more named .
Then how important is it for me to get the support of this .
I decided my goals myself , I am able to do something good for the country .
I was constantly trying to meditate those goals .
My eye lashes are fulfilled slowly on the ball .
Good luck.
Make your future .
It is believed that these words of Sachin are definitely useful for you .
Why should we not keep our memory with us 
Wherever we reached , how far we came .
Do not get stuck in the number of such numbers .
One of the most important goals of life should be to make a journey with a dream.
Therefore if you want to make a large , high dream then tests change into a fun year .
In them healthy mind remains in a healthy body .
In this context, our daily routine should be a medium of dreams and resolves for 365 days.
He has specially done that you sleep regularly , waking up early in the morning , we should do .
Taking the entry centres of test centres , other things should be reached before time .
Do not do this .
I believe that you can do this .
Although the foundation of success in life is responsible for keeping the foundation of victory nutritious .
A strong foundation falls from the infected moment .
They are unconscious , unconscious , unconscious , they do the work of swimming in the morning , the work of swimming in the afternoon is done after how much busy at night .
Not only this , our daily routine is also very important .
Therefore we should not see anything small .
Make sure, do it.
O ye friends , O ye friends 
Sometimes I saw that two types of water is seen in the students going to the test .
Who can say this better than me - Chadrang Champion Vishwanathan, who played the world's sportspersons.
He will divide his experiences with you .
Come , let us learn how to build these tests by him .
Hello, I enjoy Vishwanathan.
How I am ready for my tests , what is my experience now .
It has been seen that these tests have been done beforehand in life .
Therefore if you are peaceful , eat nutritious food , sleep straight , then your brain will remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute very important store , otherwise you will find that you have not been able to remember properly once again .
Vishwanath 's joy is really important .
How much he sits in the international charang competitions , how much concentration you will discover .
Have we heard that Arjun standing on the eyes of the bird 
If you are standing on the banks of a lake then you will find many things in water below .
Initially there was no cost of costly seem to be seen after putting stone .
If water is melted , then feet are also seen in it .
It takes 30,40,50 seconds but once my mind is ready to understand things .
This can be my experience , it is also useful for you .
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing .
He wrote in my App: We will quietly talk to at least half an hour of the day with our friends and family members.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then apply things .
Ranchi Manas has been trying to reach out to the entire world, within the country and outside the world by extending its explanation to the present situation.
Such worshipped Murari Bapu had sent an important Chitka for the students .
He is also a teacher , counseller , therefore there is a mixture of both in his words .
In your test if you move ahead with peace without any pressure then you will definitely be successful .
There is also pride of success .
In a poet, I would like to convey my message and good wishes that there is no rule of gratitude for everybody.
Learn to live together with virus also .
I am honoured to be the flagship programme of our Honourable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modis Mann Ki Baat.
I also thank him for giving a very good message to all of us .
How much happy I am .
All this has come to the birth of memory which seems very good to me .
I tell you that today, start doing yoga from the bottom of the pit, it will be wrong for you.
Very light solution .
Definitely pay attention to it .
Look, you can do them.
Why do all these things do the cost of cost .
Read these informations as per your precaution . two minutes , three minutes , five minutes .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question seems difficult .
Therefore competition tests .
Do not bed , do work without bending your strength .
And I said unto all my young friends , This is the same .
At the same time, keep in mind one thing that there is a lot of potential in this country.
Decid what you want to do in life , do not take it forever .
You win.
You don't forget about this world's maternal child.
Just like the trees and mountains, you also have the right to stay here.
You will have to take Kandalla , unconscious emotion , meditation .
By these symptoms you will be excited in all the tests .
I want to do victory in every matter .
Bless you .
Seeing , how does a great scientist speak 
I take half an hour to say , that thing is told in three minutes .
This is the strength of scientific scientific scientific science .
I am telling thanks to the children of the country for giving support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then the fear will also be scared .
The future of gold is waiting for you to do good .
Now a message from the tasteful dobbs on my app has tasted the experience of its tests.
It is said that during the tests everybody keeps trying to remain a social environment , this kind of exercise is also done in their families .
Sometimes there are many things that do not inspire the students only to inspire us.
We all read in our schools about Thamas Alva Addison, who discovered the electricity bulb.
It is said that light is filling in our life also .
It is said that Srinivas Ramjan i . . Shrinivasan i . . they do not know anybody 's cost .
You will know that no traditional education has been impossible in the past .
Raling . Hari Port Siris has changed all over the world .
Tests are not only one of these students , whole family , school , teachers .
But without massaging parents , teachers the situation of alone student is not good .
Vijayya Jindal had written that he should not carry his weight on children .
Today mothers do not want to say much to their parents .
Do not let the children fall in tension .
If you talk to a friend - do not touch him.
Why do I say that today national science day is the day of national science .
The scientific festival of the country is participated on 28 February 28 national science day .

Science Technology Based Innovations
But I want to tell this thing again to all the people of the country .
The main scientist of the last century along with adopting this research the principle of ice steine has also been recognized in physicians .

This information was given by an old worker, Dilip Singh Malviya, at Bhojpura village in Sihor district of Madhya Pradesh.

I convey my best wishes to Dilip Sinha Malviya.
I would like to hear a lot of despair about our country.
This is our strength to move ahead.
It will, therefore, be very good and comfortable to take up Dilip Sinha in Mann Ki Baat.
The occasion of Yoga Diwas is also a source of similar hunger for our country.
Swachhata Mantra has changed in every household.
There was no detailed discussion in the media so far.
But I am sure that the media will reach such villages where it will provide light to the country.
The biggest benefit of this is that the government servants in the field of electricity will get a lot of happiness and satisfaction.
We all should work together on good things, good things, good things and good things for common man.
This is also a service programme.
But I mean, should I do that too

I shall share a small issue in this Yap.
It is a matter of great pleasure for the people to share many things with me through this Yap.
You should also be a part of this effort in your system and your level.
How can I reach out to 100 crore Indians without your help
Come, let us inspire the common people to share their thoughts with them in common mans language and to inspire them to take advantage of their rights.

Once called handicapped or disabled, it is called specifically affiliated persons - many such methods are heard.
We are also aware of the importance of money.
Why should we not use the term 'Divyangs' instead of 'Divyangjans' in our country
They have only one or more organs full of divinity.
In schools, hospitals, government functions, bus stands, railway stations, ropes, parking, lifts, all the works in the Braille script - a creative endeavour to facilitate all these - need technology, system and arrangements - a comfortable and harmonious philosophy.
They should not remain dead and sustained in files.
Planning is for the common man and for the poor.
In the present times, there is no way to know whether or not.
The government has brought some changes in it.
Opening of Jan Dhan Account - Aadhaar card with the help of which the largest river in the world has reached subsidies directly to the beneficiaries' accounts through the Badili Yojana.
Similarly, I am sure that the Ginns Book of World Records will be placed in the world under the huge Direct Benefit Scheme.
The scheme has been implemented with the name of Pehle, which has been successfully used.
On the one hand, the Aadhaar card scheme, on the other hand the opening of Jan Dhan Accounts, third state and central governments have been able to wipe out the beneficiaries with Aadhaar and Account.
The National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) has been implemented in the villages.
Now approximately 40 thousand crore rupees are being directly credited to the beneficiaries through various schemes.
I am guessing that at least 35 to 40 schemes are being implemented directly by the Government of India.
This is a happy occasion for the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the founder of our Constitution.

After the earthquake in Nepal, I spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
He urged all SAARC nations to jointly address the challenges faced by the SAARC nations.
Lakhwinder Singh Ji, I am very happy to hear your words.
But this issue is not in one Punjab or Haryana.
However, the spirit that you have made today is very true.
It's not real.
The remains of fruits are also very precious.
This will help in the consumption of cattle, which will also improve our land.
Such red-tape will benefit from double taxation on the ground.
Once there is a need to talk to the taxpayers.
The water tells me about a good experience.

Noor Jahan of Kanpur is a woman.
If she looks at TV, she won't seem to be too cheap.
However, no one thinks of what she does.
Using sun-charge with solar power, it provides light to the poor.
There is a war on darkness.
The crowd takes her to Lander in the evening.
I have heard that nearly 500 houses at a very high altitude will come near her and bring lanterns.
But home is light .
However, this Noor Jahan will be able to recharge the lotteries with solar power throughout the day.
I also congratulate the GTV because the entire world has witnessed this transformation in Kanpur.
Many congratulations.

The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana lays the foundation stone for the illiterate.
The mudra will encourage entrepreneurship.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Mauritius.
The mudra actually empowers us.
This mudra yojana is being implemented for small traders.
We need to speed up the rapid pace of water conservation.
However, it started well.
42 thousand crore has been given to about 66 lakh people under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Abhishek spoke of his enthusiasm.
I also have a lot of news.
He said that Shailesh Bhonsle is the only person in Mumbai.
He said Swachh Abhiyan is a new entrepreneur.
Shailesh Bhosle had shown it .
The objective of our Mudra Yojana is also to say that.
She received 40,000 rupees from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana on the issue of Matam Sharam of Bhopal.
She is doing her job.
That is why she used to bring more money in the past and used to do a lot of business.
Now once a large number of doubs are coming together, she is doing her job better.
Because of one irreparable reason, she used to spend more on other reasons.
Now, with the benefits provided by the bank, it is getting more than a thousand rupees per month.
A good business for their family has grown gradually.
However, I would like to make a lot more propaganda for this scheme.
They should help as many small traders as possible.
We want to give them strength.

My greetings to you all.
Gandhi-Mandela Siri has been named as Gandhi-Mandela Siri.
Congratulations to him for participating in the Mann Ki Baat programme with the launch of the Mann Ki Baat Manas.
I have to say another thing about Kerala today.
St. Mary of Kerala-Kochi, Chittoor has written a script to me.
I was sent a picture of Bharat Mata in the shape of India.
I was astonished to see why they had made a picture of the shape of India with their stamps.
But I understand after reading the script that they want to convey the message of simbalance.
These girls did nothing but consciousness of the Prime Minister.
Their objective is to transform the organism into a profession.
These girls have written to me in the Mann Ki Baat Manas programme to inspire people on their contribution.
The 80-year-old Sudkey Guruji of Maharashtra has always been working with a mission.

We have seen all these in TV.
Now we have dedicated our midnight and successful journey.
Ganesh Chaturthi also celebrated.
For the first time, we have been working on the Indian Ocean at such a large scale.
We invite 54 African countries and civilians.
Africa is the largest member of the African countries outside Africa.
If both of these are connected, we will become the third largest population of the world.
More than 25,000 African students are studying in India for the development of human resources and capacity building.
Many of those who have moved here are now the heroes of many countries in Africa.
This is known in our strong relationship.
From that point of view, this House is very important.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a very good job.
Millions of students visited the exhibition.
The people of the village have seen it.
Whatever role Mahatma Gandhi played in African-India relations, the people knew the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality in these two parts.
Thereafter, many of the Parliamentarians have done this thing.
We have worked very sincerely.
A programme was organized in Bhopal in the last month.
On the Adarsh Gram Yojana, the Akhadi Gram, District Collector, Members of Parliament and all the Central and State Governments have detailed discussions on the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Unfortunately, we will hear all of these things when the acute hurdles - bombs, guns - bloodsheds come to Jharkhand in the morning.
Several places have been destroyed due to the strong impact of Left Wing Extremism.

My dear brothers and sisters, how can we express ourselves about cleanliness in this programme
This message was sent from Mumbai to Savitrai through a female library.
This time we will clean our homes and our traditions on Diwali.
As a result, the campaign itself started on cleanliness after Deepawali.
You are very sure that what we think before the festival should be brought to the forefront of the festival.
We should do this in every public programme.
Today, I convey my best wishes to all the media institutions in the country.
On the occasion of the completion of the Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on 2nd October last year, I have got the opportunity to participate in the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the commemoration of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The institute conferred the Clean India Awards.
I conveyed my best wishes to all those who have worked towards Swachh Bharat.
We have cleaned up such countries in our country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the India Television Group which has done so amazingly.
He also participated in this programme in about 55,56,000 schools in the States of Andhra and Telangana, about 51 lakh children.
Bahiranga, railway stations, spiritual countries, hospitals and parks have been spreading publicity on cleanliness in such areas.
Now these messages give us the power to realize the goals of Swachh Bharat.
Therefore, whatever Smt. Savitarai suggested, all the people of the country are now taking this initiative forward as their work.
He further said that in Asia, the most clean village, the Arvad, is a clinast village.
It was heartening to note that in our country far away, in the beautiful north-eastern region of Meghalaya, the villages have won pavilions in the field of cleanliness.
My beloved countrymen, I have said that there are some things that have been lost in the Red Fort on 15th August.
When a poor person goes to smaller industries, how much he has to pay for the recommendations, how he will ask for a dollar from the groups, how he will get the job done, how he will lose his money and not get the job done.
I have never heard in the world how many psychologists have understood one person in one or two minutes home.
Greetings to all young friends on this occasion.
And in the following budget, I have announced a flagship scheme.
In our country, gold has become a part of social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the banks.
Now do not keep gold in home .
The second thing is that in the Savarin Gold Bond, there are golden rings in your hand.
But now we started it .
Therefore, there is no need to buy gold now.
The people of the country will move forward in the coming weeks to guarantee security coverage.
I am very happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins and gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Why shouldn't we have an indigenous seal of our country
Therefore, in the coming week, before Dhan Terrace, we will start the five-gram Ashok Chakra-based Indian Gold Coins.
Besides, 20 grams of gold can also be made available to the people.
I would like to assist you in bringing about a new transformation in the direction of this new scheme.
However, one mantra - one should always be in the middle of our thinking, the way we move forward and the way we move forward.
There is a diversity in India .
Many religions, religions, traditions, many languages, different castes and cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the only mantra.
Peace, harmony and integrity are divine medicines for these developments.
Over the last several years, the 'Run for Unity' programme has been organized at several places in the country on 31st October.
Take the mantra forward.
Now you must have been in Deepawali arrangements and you must have been cleaning your houses.
New items can be bought.
The festival of Deepavali is celebrated in every corner of the country.
My best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Deepavali.
However, in the days of Deepavali, we will hear a few words.
Therefore, I am particularly enthusiastic about my visit to Britain.
It is indeed a matter of study in the world for the empowerment of women for the Bhagwan Vishwaswar people many years ago.
The statue of Bhagwan Vishwaswar on the soil of London will be an excellent example of how India's great men think about it.
In a country like India, we should learn our own languages.
I will also try to reach you in your language for 8 hours at night.
However, there has been a good relationship between us.
The last year has been completed.
Now we are entering a new year.
My best wishes to my beloved countrymen once again.
PM's Mann Ki Baat Programme (Declaration), September 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - Talk in Manas - One year, many words.
I don't know what you've achieved, but I can't tell you how much I have achieved.
The power of the people is immensely great in the masses.
I have a very first thought in my life and I am deeply touched by the power of the people.
However, I learnt from Mann Ki Baat through a talk programme in Manas, I understood, I got it, so I would say that we think more and more peoples power is dangerous.
Our ancestors say that people are a part of a divine future.
But lakhs of people used to consciously send messages to me.
It is a great power in itself.
These millions of enthusiastics have taught me a great lesson.
That is, the information should reach the top level from the bottom level, which must go from the top to the bottom.
He said that this message will change in Mann Ki Baat Mann Ki Baat.
But this has happened.
In the same way, Mann Ki Baat - Mann Ki Baat has transformed into an urgent need to showcase the power of the common man.
I urge all the citizens to take note of the tourism sector in India, incredible India and brothers and sisters, if you are going, if you have any good photographs then I will see it.
However, there has been a lot of trouble.
Like lakhs, people from all parts of the country sent photographs.
It is an experience for the power of the people.
Once I speak in Mann Ki Baat Manus, there is a lot of light in the houses of the poor and children are crying.
It is extremely difficult for the common man, middle class and middle class to leave the stone.
There is nothing from Siachen, but from the Kutch region, but from Cameroop, Kashmir or Kanyakumari to Gony-Phone.
Fonds were done from all places .
This is a pleasant experience.
He sent his message to all age groups.
I would like to hear a few messages myself, I am very good.
My team is working on the rest of them.
However, the reason is that they cannot watch TV and listen to radio tapping.
I am aware of the importance of radio for those who dont have vision.
I see another new feature, how many good things they have told - it is enough to consciously uphold the government.
Pawan Acharya sent a message from Alwar, Rajasthan.
Soil pumps are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I have had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with our soldiers on the eve of Vinayak Chaturthi.
Our Armed Forces, Navy, Air Force, Army, Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force
The war with Pakistan was completed 50 years in 1965.
In this context, an exhibition was organized at the India Gate in Delhi.
I saw how luxury I had seen it .
Fighting and fighting in Hajipur, however, the day-long fighting took place in Ghani and Chamunda, but the joys will be overwhelmed by seeing the victorious scenes of the Jawandi and Hajipur Pass.
Charitra will be connected with our heritage.
I would like to see you and your families - if you are around Delhi then it will be a few days more.
Don't go on seeing it as soon as possible.
I returned in two and a half hours.
A young boy asked the Prime Minister, but the boy soon forgot to mention his name.
For the first time since independence, the Parliament has been discussing the issue of cleanliness for hours.
I am seeing good in this .
The country Parliament also looks forward to discussing the issue of cleanliness.
On the one hand, the parliamentarians, on the other hand the citizens of the country are talking about cleanliness.
And you know what Mahatma Gandhi would say.
Once he said that if we have to choose one of both freedom and hygiene, we will choose one of our cleanliness.
Gandhijis cleanliness is more important than independence.
He said that Din Dayal ji wants to know about the centenary year.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
Anything incurred or incurred for Rs. 5, fifteen or fifty will be paid to those bank account holders.
The joy will also give you a little bit.
When I went to Kolkata in May, members of Subhash Chandra Bose's family came and met.
Chandra Bose, son of Sodurni, was also present on the occasion.
Subhash Babu got the opportunity to spend the evening with joy and happiness with the family members.
Chandra Bose and his family members are in the fray for the last week and more than 50 members of the Subhash Bose family have come to the Prime Ministers residence.
But they are more enjoyable than that - the opportunity to host such a great man would never have come to the Prime Ministers residence, which will be available to me in October.
This is why more than 50 members of the Subhash Babu family are coming from different countries.
Is it a comfort to enjoy it
Is it safe to have the precious power I have received
In the meanwhile, I have visited Kashi.
Many people were mixed.
He added that one student was Kshitij Pandey.
Banaras Hindu University is gaining some degree in central universities.
However, at such a young age, we looked at physics related issues.
Whatever he said, he had a subtle knowledge, but his faith and belief.
I believe that all the children of the country will be interested in scientific matters.
Sometimes it also gives a little joy on such occasions.
Sometimes our sky-high friends - half an hour .
But I will imagine your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Now it is perfect for a month.
You know that the Mann Ki Baat programme has been completed in a year.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu uses radio
Azad Hind Radio was interacted with Weekly News Bulletin.
He used to conduct radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Pass and Urdu languages.
I am now talking to you in the sky.
My Mann Ki Baat - In my mind, the word has become meaningful and meaningful in your mind.
I am, but these things will be yours.
Your suggestions should be there.
Your suggestions will also benefit the government.
There will be greater interaction.
Man Ki Baat, August 2015
On the second time I got the opportunity to tell words in my mind .
In the southern direction of Sudur, people are immersed in Oman Sabar and celebrated the holy Raksha Bandhan Festival throughout the country.
The Government of India has entered many new ways for the social society of common people .
11 crore households have been covered under this scheme since its inception.
On the occasion of Puducherry Raksha Bandhan, I extend my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters.
Today, I would like to talk to you about the 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana' in a big way.
Youth guests have also been found . In one year Bangkoking Rang , economy , names .
Do not stop opening of bank accounts.
We have linked ourselves to the poor with the help of banks.
These banks are yours, you don't leave them now.
I have brought them to you, it is your privilege to continue buying them now.
All of us should have bank accounts alive.
I don't think you're going to buy it.
The incidents and violent incidents of Gujarat have merged the entire country.
Anything that happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel will bring about a lot of distress and destruction in the country.
However, in a short span of time the elders of Gujarat, my brothers and sisters, all the citizens of Gujarat have come to a standstill.
He played a key role in addressing the situation without delay.
Peace, unity and harmony are the right path.
Their words do not negotiate, that is, the essence of the Sufi sect, the harmony that exists in it, is hiding in music.
I felt all this while staying amongst them.
I believe that there is a need for the entire world to understand the true nature of Islam in the right way.
I am sure that the spirit of love in the Sufi community and its affluence will reach far flung areas.
I would also like to inform others that we need to understand the sufficiency of any of our partners.
I am fortunate that I will get another opportunity in a hurry.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the world will come to Bodhgaya in India.
I had to participate in it and I was very happy to invite him to come to Bodhgaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of our country, went to Bodhgaya.
Even before this, I have mentioned this thing in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
We have issued an Ordinance on earthquake.
The Ordinance is scheduled to expire tomorrow on 31st August.
But there was a deep in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, we have taken this decision forward not only in the business sector but also in the field of agriculture and farming.
You don't have to be a victim of fears.
It is usual to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri when the 1965 war broke out.
It is also common to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
It is extremely relevant to recall the trinity of India and its proud privileges.
Such historical events always inspire us.
As I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi community last week, it was a pleasant occasion.
I have had the opportunity to interact with eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How to connect the laboratory to the area
It has to be taken forward in a way.
Whatever dreams they have in their eyes, I have said in the following programme: Students have the great potential to move towards vision science.
Especially tell my young friends one thing.
Everybody is running in the lower level which can also be the reason behind this .
The decision to liberate small enterprises from interview will now approximately be implemented.
This is the first time that this meeting will be held in other countries outside America.
About 50 thousand pride and 13 lakh children in our country are still reproducing at the time of childbirth or after childbirth.
As we get rid of polio, we also get rid of tetanus in case of maternal and child mortality.
There are reports about dengue in between.
We should not die so easily.
How much price is life .
Not paying attention to drinking water, hygiene and hygiene are the causes of death - it is not possible.
Dengue assessment tests are available free of cost in 514 centres across the country.
Now we will not get the opportunity to change for the country but we will get the opportunity to live for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Sometimes due to lack of awareness, we are unfair to our youth.
I believe that this Orissa has been centuries old.
My experience with youth is different.
Sometimes talking to the youngsters - there is a need to learn a lot from them.
They say, "Sande on Cycle".
It is said that we are playing a cycle of one day a week.
Mann Ki Bath , June 2019 .
O my beloved country , worship .
Sometimes our words inspire us .
How to spend my time in this middle can imagine yourself .
On Sunday , the last Sunday at 11 o'clock I felt as if something had lost .
It feels sure.
Probably this is not a regular program .
In this program there was life , it seemed that mind was luxurious , heart was luxurious , therefore this program came to this program in the middle of this program I felt very difficult .
But this Sunday has waited a lot.
Many messages have come in the past few months and people have also said that Mann Ki Baat is being missed.
It will be very good for me when I read these .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in how many acquaintances 
I can fulfil your curiosity .
I also feel that those feelings should be divided with you .
But if they talk then the form of 'Man Ki Baat' changes.
I am Baaldera before the end of how many halts , Jaypajayas , even before the end of Polling .
Many people were discovered in it .
It's my turn, I have the chance to spend with me.
And now I can say this thing that because of the small break in Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to fill in the valleys of Kedar and in that solitary cave.
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
When I do not say that I do but I definitely do .
Because you have that right over me.
In the matter of Kedar people have considered how to be careful about some positive things with the same imagination , in your words many times .
Sometimes the work of chewing my thoughts also keep doing your words .
People , country , society , social problems , challenges , along with bringing them in my sight they also keep on telling them .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , then the pollution keeps trying to give their wrath to cleanliness as well .
That is , the results of one type of problems are seen in your words in the society of society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat, the society's anger is like an egg.
The subject of international power , strength , talent situated in the country is known by this .
There is a need to activate these strengths and talents by providing them an opportunity.
One more thing to know from this Mann Ki Baat is that all 130 crore people want to participate actively and effectively in the development of the country.
You can imagine how much energy I can enjoy when I am analysing such things.
Actually I didn't come, you brought me up, you gave me a chance to talk again.
With this feeling we moved ahead the tradition of 'Mann Ki Baat'.
There was a obstruction in the mind of all people .
Therefore the country has given invitation to how many solutions for the protection of democracy besides its own profit .
Perhaps in any country of the world, the people of that country have not only taken the rest of their rights, powers and necessities for democracy but have also seen 77 (debt 77).
Today, our country has witnessed a massive thrust on democracy, from wealth to the poor, everybody participated in this festival with joy to decide the future of our country.
Anything that we'll understimate when we're close to us, we'll also ignore its aiming facs.
We can see this number somehow or the other but if we look around the world then we can say that if we leave China then more than the population of any other country of the rest of the world is at this stage.
How many people were put in so many numbers in 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America .
The total number of Ooty in India is more than the population of Europe .
It indicates the magnitude of our democracy.
The number of members in 2019 is still the biggest democracy of the world in history .
In such a situation you can imagine how big level human power , arrangements are needed .
Lacs of teachers , rulers , workers , workers , day and night this is possible .
Approximately three lakh Paramilitary teams conserved their responsibilities to enhance this spirit of democracy, and 20 lakh police personnel of various states also worked at a very proud level.
As a result of their difficult industry this time more Ooting has been done more than this time .
You can imagine 10 lakh Polling Stations across the country, over 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh Vivipaat (VVPAT) missions, in such a big way.
It has also been done that no one Ooty should not come to use his Ooty .
A Polling station has been set up for only one woman Ooty in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place of the world is in India .
It is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Not only this , how many prides are there .
Perhaps for the first time in history, women also participated in Ooting with enthusiasm like men.
The quantity of polio of women , men is approximately equal .
Although the reality of enthusiasm is that in parlor today 78 -LRB- sex -RRB- women are employed .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard many times that I say, "Not only book".
My prayer is to give books instead of flowers in welcome .
Approximately at many places such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, Nakewaro gave a book titled 'Prem Chand Ki Lok Priya Kahania'.
It gave me a lot .
I did not get much time , when I was in labor , I got a chance to read some stories again .
Their stories reflect the feelings of the whole of India.
While reading the story "Nasha", I turned my attention towards the economic imbalances of the society.
When I was young then I remembered how many nights were spent in this matter .
If the son of Jammu is not cautious about this story of Ishwari, the family of the poor, then we will know that when the effect of bad company falls.
The second legend Id Gah, the heartbeat of a child, his love for his parents, his enlightenment at such a young age.
Taking 4 . years from Hamid Sanctuary to go to my mother , in reality it is said to be the pride of human heart .
The last lines of this story are not so emotional, the small Hamid old hamid part plays - old Amina and Amina have become a small sin.
In the same way, 'Poos Ki Rath' is a martial story.
In this story a poor life style is seen .
If its fruit was destroyed then Haldu Ritu had to sleep at night like a field in the cold shivering itself .
In reality these stories are old for a century , today it seems sufficient to be adventurous .
After reading these I felt a special feeling .
If we talk about reading , then in some media I read about Akshay Kshetra Library of Kerala .
If this library is in a village of dense forests then you will not be surprised .
The first school teacher there was P . . .
K . . .
Both of them were polluted for this library .
Once the books have to be taken by bending on the shoulders .
Today this Library is looking everybody along with the children of tribals .
In Gujarat the garden of Gujarat -LRB- Gujarat -RRB- is a successful use .
In lacs of numbers all age groups participate in this garden .
Definitely write in the NarendraModi App about the book that has been read and all the listeners in the Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My beloved countrymen , apart from the present people of our country think about the subjects of future besides the present .
When I read your comments in the NarendraModi App and My Voices, many people are writing about the problem of water.
Pavan Gaurai in Belgaum, Sitasu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar and others have written about water related problems.
Water is very important in our culture .
It has been said about the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness of the sadness .
Every year in many places of the country the problem of water is lifting up .
In the water of rainy season along with the year we are hiding only 8  water in the water of rainy season that you are not surprised .
Only 8  .
The result of this problem has to be discovered .
The rest of the problems are also solved by the participation of the people , with the capacity of the people of the country , with the help of the capacity of 100 crores of people .
A new Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country, especially considering the importance of water.
By this decisions can be taken fast in all matters related to water .
Some people did a new work .
The surface of all the serpents of the country has written the north of the village .
It has been written that for making a collection of water for the villagers , to collect water , to collect water every drop of rain water in the village , to make them a collection in the village .
In this work participating with full enthusiasm in this month crores of people were afflicted in 22 thousand Panchayatti .
People in the villages have made an attempt to contribute every drop of water .
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I will tell you a sympathetic voice.
The Lupung Panchayat Serpent of Katam Sandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand gives us a message and my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there are ready to play their role once again for the conservation of water .
All the villagers , all the serpents have many ruins for their activity .
People of the village , to build their village water temples it seems as if they are falling .
Before I looked positive results of excitement with a collective attempt .
There is no alternative for the support of the problem of water throughout the country .
Therefore in various places of the country , various types of attempts are being made .
That's why the problem of water logging is solved.
A major change has been brought about due to the small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
Twenty thousand women have collectively tried to revive the river Nag in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
I also read that even in Garhwal, all the women are working together on the Rain Water Harvesting.
Such efforts are being done very much . I believe that if we try to make the impossible even possible .
My first request - how the people of the country had pursued cleanliness and also started a public mission for water conservation.
I believe that water is the prasad of Parmeshwar.
To save one drop of water, we will make an effort.
Talk about the problems of water in it , talk about water conservation methods .
I specially urge the Innovative Campagnes to take the lead in conserving water for the mainstream of various regions.
Leave films , let us not play games , let us not let our friends of media , let us not let the people of social institutions , not let the people of cultural heritage , but let everybody in their own way .
Wake up the society , do the society together with the society .
See , we definitely see changes before our eyes .
I would like to share the traditional methods of conservation of water.
If any of you have the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Porbandar , Pujaya Bapu , there is a house behind the house of worshipped Bapu where there is a water storage tank of 200 years .
Therefore I always say that if someone goes to Kirti temple then definitely see that water tank .

Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Italy is India 's mind while starting the Manki Bath .
The creator of ten days Bharatma had lost his sons .
These infected people lose their life for the protection of 125 crore people of our country .
For sleeping peacefully these virtues save us from their sleeping .
Our armies are always displaying unparalleled courage , valour .
Ram Niranjan Ji, the father of Amarvir Ratan Thakur of Bagalpur in Bihar, in such a sad moment, how inspires all of us.
He told us that he will also fight against his second son to fight against enemies , if necessary he will also fight .
Seeing the courage of the wife of Amarvir Prasanna Sahu 's wife of Jagatsinghpur of Orissa , the country of Yavat worshipped her .
These small psychologists tell us all the small children of India .
Such feelings , we get to see in the houses of our virtue , paralysis .
Their families also have no mineral in it .
The martyr of Deoria, the family of Vijaya Maurya, the parents of Tilak Raj of Kangra, the son of the fort, the son of Hem Raj, the son of a six-year-old, is inspired by the story of every family of these martyrs.
I have to make an attempt to understand the feelings exhibited by these families .
The living witnesses situated in front of our eyes are the inspirational examples of India .
My beloved countrymen , freedom came home , all of us are waiting for a memorial of war .
I was surprising , anxiety was not the memorial of national war in India .
It is a memorial to preserve the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation .
I have decided to make such a memorial in the country.
It is a matter of very happy to finish this construction at a very little time when we made one of the national war memorials .
To morrow , i . . February 25th honey , our crore people of the country have given this national soldiers to the army of this national soldiers .
It is a small attempt to fulfil their debt .
The memorial was organised near the heart of Delhi, where India Gate, Amarvir Jyoti is located in Delhi.
It is a belief that visiting this national soldiers memorial is like a pilgrimage to the people of the country .
After the independence of the country the soldiers given more sacrifices for the country are the symbol of this national soldiers .
The shape of this memorial exhibits the unparalleled adventure of our martyrs.
The National Soldiers Memorial is based on four core concentration circles, the first circumnavigation of the entire journey from the birth of every soldier was depicted.
The martyr of the Jwala Wheel of Amarkantak is a symbol of Amarkantak .
The second circumference cycle.
There is a queue of dense trees in this circle .
If seen on softness , to know about the important martyrs of our country , to tell them thanksgiving them , it has become a place to display this national memorial .
To stay with our lives, the country remains safe, to develop their lives, their asses are here.
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the important contributions of our weapons , police , Para Military teams .
In the last year in October I also got the fortune of giving this national memorial to the country .
This national police is a memorial of the thoughts of proclaiming thanksgiving thanks to the women Police and other men who have been continuously running for the protection of all of us .
I hope to see all the memorials of the national soldiers , national police memorial .

How beautiful museums have been fulfilled all the rooms closed .
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, a museum for the Indian National Army, and another museum with 1857-Eighteen Fifty Siven, Indias First War of Independence.
In every brick of the rooms situated in these museums our glorious history is full of Taluku .
At this very very place the British Government had run on the virtues of Mother India - Karnal Love Sehgal, Karnal Guru Bhaksh Singh Dialogue, Major Janal Shahnawaz Khan.
On displaying memories related to Netaji in the Cranti temple of Red Fort the family members of Netaji gave me a rare cap .

You will know that Guru Govindranath Tagore is a musical instrument .

Those who see their pictures , understand that picture themselves , they want to understand the message situated in that picture with their own eyes .
His leopards have also been exhibited in European countries , Russia , America .
I believe that you will definitely go to see his leopards in the Cranti temple .

Filled with spirituality this Kumbh is an important Kumbh of India .
This Kumbh of the devotees should be a great Kumbh of the world tourism .

Bat , November 2018 .
On the 3rd day of October 2014 , on the day of victory , on the day of the festival of victory , Mann Ki Baat started a journey together through Mann Ki Baat .
Our Mann Ki Baat Dharawahi Yatra completes fifty links with these days.
That is why this is our Golden Jubuli Apsod , that is , the Golden Festival of Italy is the same thing .
This time phone calls , norths coming from all of you have also proposed to recognize this golden festival .
Shri Anshu Kumar of Delhi, Amar Kumar, Patna-Vikas Yadav
What is the week , people ask you to say that the newest technique of technology , social media is the medium of media , mobile ypnotise is a person .
But why do you choose radio to meet people 
I will tell you a story .
It was in 1998 .
I am a member of the Indian Peoples Party, which is the time to work in Himachal Pradesh.
The cost of ' Bharat ' is licked with a bomb .
I don't mean anything."
Then he said , Behold , listen to radio , radio has been discussed on the same thing in radio .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpei Garden came forward , told that the air conditioned test has been done on that day .
It was estimated that the power of radio was estimated .
It is natural to return my sight toward the most powerful medium after I became the prime minister .
Feed Back coming in this survey is very interesting .
How expansive discussion has also been done about the position of the puja .
This is an example of the point of view of social , positive emotional feelings situated in the minds of all our country .
Because of the program of Mann Ki Bath the feeling of voluntary service in people has also increased their experiences .
People are coming forward at a big height for the service of the society and this is a change .
I am very happy to change radio more favorite to people because of the program of Mann Ki Baat .
The northern tips , online trade , phones , phones , in all these the objects of the objects are clearly visible .
Modi comes , but this country remains stable , our culture remains stable .
All these small stories of the country of 130 crores are alive forever .
All this gives new inspiration to this country , how does the highest peaks with new enthusiasm .
My experiences also participate with water as well .
After that gradually this thing comes towards a change by buying the sugar of house , social meditation , Watsop .
Teaching all his households, sometimes even the Prime Minister in the phone calls becomes a small pesticide.
When can the government be able to harness the power of selfiewithdaughter from a small village in Haryana, not only in the country but also abroad
Many times Man Ki Bath has also been identified but in my mind 130 crore people of the country are always there .
My mind is all of them .
Man Kei Bath is not the word of the government , this is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is a spiritual India, a revered India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious gloriously .
If you want to answer your question easily then there is nothing to make.
I'm a very easy job for me.
Every time the north of the people comes in front of Man Ki Bath .
In My Gau, Narendra Modi Mobile Yap, people share their thoughts and also have a toll free number 1800117800.
People done this November record their message with their throat .
Before the beginning of Mann Ki Bath my attempts to read more north , more expansive expansions themselves .
I will hear many phone calls myself .
Do not fall near the Man Ki Bath Programme , in the time of my journey I will read how much of the thoughts that you have sent .
Every moment all the people of my country are in my mind . Therefore who read any north , north , their emotions become part of my thoughts .
This north is not only the piece of Kaiti .
In reality things that is , the name of the village , person etc . do the mouth of the description .
I thank all those who participated in the Mann Ki Baat, for example, Bhavodav, Utjjain and Mann Ki Baat.
Not reading their northern , trade , not reading , but again the number of people sending northern , trade is in lakhs .
An attempt is also made to bring in unparalleled norths and information related departments in Mann Ki Baat and I will also be visiting the Akashwani, F.
It is said that Radio , Doordarshan , remaining T . . . channels , social meditations have also been told to all my colleagues .
Because of their trouble Manki Bath reached maximum people .
Akashwani Vrindra every Manki Bath program is published in many languages .
Some people are listening to Man Ki Bath with the sound of being near the throat of Modi throat in the province language as well .
Similarly they are changing the Nrandra Modi along with those thirty minutes .
You all also want to hear the program of Manki Bath in your language .
It is believed that everybody has been considered to be less convenience about themselves , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
But the media has changed many things proposed in Man Kei Bat .
Cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with daughter etc. have worked in a new way to guide the media.
If you do not support then the journey of this monkey was incomplete .
"Thank you so many more than Gunnu, your phone call.
If you want to say then there is no secret near me .
Our old things of our own life do not obstruct us , it is easy to understand anyone before us .
Sometimes our paralysis gives the biggest stop to the conferences .
Not confessing , not confessing , trying to understand something instead of every activity is my first importance .
I am trying to talk with the youth in various programs or social meditation .
I am trying to understand that they do , I am trying to understand .
It is very good to question the youth .
They're specialists in multi-tasking.
If we pay attention to our neighbourhood then social interference i . . Startups , sports or any other kind of changes in the society .
Does the youth adventurously adventurous dreams , big dreams 
If we bring young thoughts to the ground and give them freedom to adopt them then they can bring about social changes in the country.
My beloved countrymen, I would like to talk about the state which is going to come tomorrow in Mann Ki Baat i. e.
It is very special today , because we have embraced the state , today we are asking in the seventieth year .
Blessed is the blessedness of your information .
In the deficiency of three times all these Mahamahals gave us such an expansive state .
The sea shore built with an extraordinary speed is also an example of Time management cool , producing cycle .
It also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities during record .
It is a confluence of the great personalities of the country that the people of the country are empowered and the people of the country are also empowered.
About the responsibilities , responsibilities have been described in our state that is the speciality of our state .
Both of these conveniences take the country forward in the lives of the country.
On the identification of Nakinkan , 2010 when 60 years of the state of India were completed , in Gujarat we swim on the elephant .
To encourage the kingdom in youth , to encourage the kingdom of their state it is an attempt to make them aware of the state .
In the year 2020 we complete 70 years in the form of a Ganesha and we complete our independence in 2022 .
My beloved country , if the state is talking about the council , then the root of the state is unforgettable with Mahabharata standing in the center of the state .
Praswamy Babasaheb is in Narnarayan . India 's democracy has not come from outside .
What is the cost of Ganesha meaning copulation meaning what is copulation .
India fast : This is the original mantra of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
On the second time the worshipped Babasaheb Ambedkar Ji is a devotion of listening to the queen .
Guru Nanak Devgarh was always along with the category of people .
He had seen the way of truth , Karma , service , mercy , spiritual path .
In the coming year, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji is celebrated with great pride in the country and the joy of these festivals spreads across the world.
All the state governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival gloriously .
Similarly 550 Jayant Festival of Guru Nanak is celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train is also run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak Ji .
I was reminded of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara when I participated in an event related to it.
Due to the earthquake coming in 2001 the Gurudwara also got injured rapidly .
But the state government , associated with local people , the shore of that Gurudwara gives an example of all these .
The Government of India has taken a major decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the tourists of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
Come , let us move ahead .
Man Ki Bath , October 2018 .
On 31th October 31th honey the favorite Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel is the birthplace of all us .
Like every year on that day also the youth of the country is ready to participate in the ' Run for Unity ' running for IIDS .
Now the weather is also adventurous .
I am also expecting a large number of people participating in this race for unity.
Six and a half months before independence , on 27 January 1947 , an international journal of the world famous 'Time Magazine ' has been published .
This journal has given the status of India in its lid store .
But it is not like the falling of India .
It is the fall of India divided into many parts .
There were approximately 550 national institutions in the country .
The interest of the English has decreased in India but they want to go to India by pieces of pieces .
Time magazine has also made other stores of the life of man in his business .
It has been told that in 1920 how he was organised in the floods coming in Ahmedabad , how Bardoli Satyal Museum .
Sardar Patel had discovered one problem , completed the impossible work of making the country accomplished .
Looking at all this India bound with the Ikta Sutra , we remember the Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel directly .
Settled on the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of this statue is double the statue of liberty in America.
This is the biggest idol of the world .
The highest statue of the world is in our country that every Indian is now proud .
Not only this the Sardar Patel guide engraved with the earth now also increase the splendor of sky .
It is natural to see this idol of every Indian .
It is my belief that the people of every corner of India consider this place as the most favorite visiting place.
My beloved brothers and sisters , all the people of our country are celebrating ' Infantry Day ' .
I salute all the participants of Indian army .
I am also selecting their adventurous families of our soldiers .
But all the people of our country know why this ' Infantry Day ' is celebrated .
On this day, our Indian soldiers saved Kashmir from the Chorbat roads on the grass of Kashmir.
For this historical incident also there is a direct relation with Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel .
I have read a great Indian army officer Taluku Old International -LRB- conversation -RRB- once .
In this conference Field Marshal Sammnekshaw had remembered the day when he was calculating .
At that time soldiers started fighting in Kashmir in October 1947 .
It is late to send the army of Kashmir that in one conclusion the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had discovered the fild Marshal Sammel Shakhwa in the memory of the fild Marshal Shakhwa of Kashmir has also not been able to see his folk songs of Kashmir .
My favorite country 's favorite country , nobody likes .
Sports , strength , epidemic , capacity - all these are important .
These are a sports of a sports .
How important is the construction of any country of these four qualities .
The country which has all these qualities in the youth of the country , not only economic , scientific , technology but also exhibits its victory in the game .
Italy has been administered me two times .
Firstly, in the Asian Para Games 2018, we got the opportunity to meet our para athletes.
In these sports, our para athletes, who have created a record by studying 72 dimensions of India, have enhanced the pride of India.
These parts got the fortune of meeting para athletes themselves .
Similarly, the summer yatth Holympics 2018 in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youngsters have exhibited more than ever before in the Yath Holympics 2018.
In these competitions, our country has spent three other dimensions in the MICE event with thirteen dimensions.
This time in Asia creed also our country will remember everyone .
In some minutes how many times I am more than this , see whether it is more important than this .
India is not only in the field of sports but also in the way we have never imagined India as a new record.
In order to lead a life without coming out of the Athoshan Temple he did the work of cleaning DTC buses, lighting in Dhabal situated on the roadsides of Delhi .
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , golden objects of India .
Not only this , see the capacity of increasing in India sports .
India has never achieved any Olympic measure in both Senior Level Level Level, Junior Level in Judo.
But in the Europe Olympics the history of Tababi Devi has created the history of silver .
Sixteen young sportsperson Tababi Devi resides in a village in Manipur .
If the father goes to the hireling , then the mother ' s fish was sold .
Many times there were no money for food in their house .
In such situation also the courage of Tababi Devi has not been decreased at all .
The history has created the neck for the country .
Every young person, he is the recognition of Sport- New India.
My beloved countrymen, all of you will remember that in 2017 FIFA UNDER17 World Cup was organised successfully.
The most successful tournament gives the youth world .
We have also created a new chapter in the number of stars in the FIFA Under17 World Cup.
More than twelve lakh audiences from the stadiums of different places of the country enjoyed watching the football competitions , encouraged the youth games .
This year, India got the fortune of hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Complex starts 28 December 16 December .
Any kind of sports playing Indian or some other sports Indian hockey is definitely interesting .
In Hockey sports India has a golden history .
The magnificence of Haki Mantra is known worldwide about Major meditation .
After that Balvindar Singh Sinier , Leslie Claudius -LRB- Leslie Claudius -RRB- , Mohammad Shahid , Uddham Singh has decided a very big journey from Dhanraj .
These are giving inspiration to new waves playing games with their industry , handicrafts with their industry .
Watching the excited competitions is a good opportunity for the lovers of games .
Watching the hockey matches going to Bhubaneswar yourself encourage our players .
Many people are coming forward to organise social programs of my beloved country , social programs . They also give inspiration to all the people of the country .
We will be able to see this legacy at every place in the society and every place in the society that has come to thousands of centuries.
But in this new age , new generations are coming forward to do these tasks with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name is ' self 4 societies ' . My version , and the other country ' s IT , electronic instruments have not been able to motivate their workers to carry out social programs , so that they have given them the right opportunity to do this portal .
To organise this program all Indians are proud to see the enthusiasm , faiths seen throughout the week .
From IT to society, I don't, we don't, we're not arrogant, it's the journey of crossing the summit.
Some children read , some elders are reading .
Some people pay attention to cleanliness , some help rails .
There is no feeling behind all these . only the feeling of dedication , culture is only incomplete .
A young man himself learned the wheelchair basketball to help the hair of Divyangs.
Mission mode activity i . . this zeal is the feeling of dedication .
Definitely he feels pride .
"Not me, we" inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time, if I look at your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen an interesting remark from Pondicherry to Shri Manish Mahapatra.
What is in his guide , ' Bharatti Gijan traditions , customs , nature along with nature you should say in the program of Man Ki Baat ' .
Mansh Garu , such things will be impossible for proposing you before the subjects of Mann Ki Bath .
It is a good opportunity to inspire us to look back to our glorious culture and past that these are being discussed to protect the environment of the world, especially the western countries.
Our India also faces this problem .
For its result we should take a pill once in ourselves and see our history , traditions once again .
Especially we should know the lifestyle of our tribals . It is in the culture of our tribals .
Our brothers of tribals worship trees , trees , fruits and goddesses .
The tribals of Bhil Teg residents of Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region of Madhya Pradesh worship Ravi , Arjun trees .
In the desert area like Rajasthan Vishnoi society has seen how to conserve environment conservation .
Especially in the matter of conserving trees they are ready to make their life soldiers but one tree does not harm .
It is believed that the Mishmi pestilence of Arunachal Pradesh is related to tigers .
The tigers are considered to be their gardens .
In Nagaland also tigers are protected from forests .
In the bridging season of central India fishing is stopped in some places of the Cathen river in the bridging season .
Adivasis make their houses with natural substances which are also good for propagation along with being strong.
In South India a small cutting of smoke residing in the solitary areas of Nilgiri Peeth is made with small things found in their own place .
It is true that my beloved brother Sodariman , the tribal community believes that they will live a peaceful and peaceful life in themselves .
My beloved countrymen , in Man Ki Baat we will tell the identity of the people who have done extraordinary work for the society .
Seeing small , it has a very deep effect on those tasks .
I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab for some days .
A common Ratu Gurubachan Singh has been married with labour .
Before this marriage Gurubachan Garhwal had married the marriage of the parents of the parents , but I was a serpent .
But all of you will be surprised by listening to the simple brother Gurubachan asking Gurubachan , that is the true strength of our society .
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh is such an example before us .
I read about Kallar Majra, another small village near Nabha in Punjab.
Why does this village come to the churches of Karlar Majra , where people want to burn grains instead of burning in the field , instead of burning them in the field , how much technology is necessary for it .
My brother Guruban Singh is my opinion .
To keep the environment clean for the people of Kallar Majra , to keep the environment clean .
Your entire clean lifestyle is moving ahead in the true way of Indian tradition .
On occurrence of drops , wrinkles , small precautions , good tasks , social tasks , always play an extremely important role in making the environment of social environment .
We establish peace at every place in life , in heart , in me , in every part of the world .
The 11th November coming to India is special because the first world war of November was completed .
The end of the war was completed , when the heavy destruction occurring , people get completed one century .
First world war is an important incident of India .
If we want to say right then we have no relation with unconscious war .
Even then our soldiers fought with so much virtue , how big role was played , most sacrifices were given .
When the war came then Indian soldiers had seen the world to take them away .
In rare places , poisonous situations also our soldiers have seen their beauty .
The only purpose behind this is to restore peace.
In the first world war the world has seen the destination of world .
According to estimates approximately one fort soldiers , other fort people lost their lives .
Therefore peace is so important that the world knows how important .
In the last bridge the meaning of peace has changed .
It is peace , sadness meaning not only the war is not possible .
Change in the environment from acute pain , economic development has to change the social judgment of social judgment .
Nirodh is the true signal of the development of the person .
My beloved country , our north-eastern states are different .
The natural beauty of this place is estimated that the people here are extremely different .
This award, which gives you for best polycy packing in this hole, is similar to that hole in the oscar.
Not only this our Sikkim had discovered this adventurous to cross fifty naminated milk from twenty five countries .
For this I am telling many opinions of Sikkim people .
My beloved country , October has become .
Many changes are also happening in the environment .
At the same time the weather of festivals has also come . Dhan Terracotta , Deepavali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat . in the month of November .
All these festivals of all the people of the country are many spectacles .
You all want that in these festivals not only your tuberculosis but also keep in mind your health .
To make new decisions also these festivals give opportunity .
With a mission mode, I would like to make these festivals an opportunity for you to move forward in your life.
Your development is an important part of the development of the country.
If you have developed so much that the country will progress as much as the country .
Your everyone is my many blessings .
