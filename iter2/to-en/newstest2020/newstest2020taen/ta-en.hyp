There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
However, it is not simply appreciated that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have provided a new evolution and a clear ideal for revolutionary movements and Indian politics.
We can still see that there is an opinion among the people that the revolutionaries are merely moths and unconcerned about human lives.
The era of Bhagat Singh makes us feel their humanity, their explicit thinking and capabilities.
On April 29, 1929, after the legislative bombing, the name of Bhagatsingh spread to India.
In 1930, he made his debut in Tamilnadu.
But within a year of his debut, his praise has spread all over Tamilnadu at a rapid pace.
This is the most surprising news in history, including Gandhiji, that none of the north-nation heads have been named in Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.
The reason for this is the father Periyar.
The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial emerged in the Republican Week magazine entitled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's characteristics and presented some comments on the political situation of that day.
Sections from the headline: -
'If he really decides that Bhagat Singh should be the right way to fulfill his policies, and if he decides, he must act accordingly, and if he doesn't do so, we can't say that he is a genuine man.
Now we will call him a real man.
It is our strong idea that Bhagat Singh's policy is really important for India.
If Shri Bhagat Singh was not hanged and surviving, this success would not have been the proof of such popularity.
Let us say that if we had not pushed Bhagat Singh away, there would have been a lot of consolidation for Gandhiji.
Why did Bhagsingh succumb to his life to show the path of real equality and comfort to the people of the world to the people of India
We appreciate Bhagatsingh as a man who cannot be achieved by ordinary people."
'Father Periyar has said in a Republican editorial.

I was very shocked when he said he was arrested, and said it would be difficult for a 6-year-old child to understand and explain.

There was no need to build further vaccines.
If necessary, Kalaignar ji, who was then the then Chief Minister, would have given immediate permission, allocated funds and stepped up his work.
Therefore, there is no way to blame the League government for maintaining Cauvery's health.
I ask you, how many inhibitions have you built in Cauvery in the last eight years of the ADMK regime
We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK regime.
Can you point out that a dam has been constructed under the ADMK regimes so far
Don't lie.
If the opposition leader's accusations are answerable - we are planning or planning to build vaccines at other places.
I have been obliged to point out that the DMK regime has not been vaccinated in Cauvery, but that it may be beautiful if it is for a personal element, that it is not a civilised act or beauty for the post of chief minister.'

Does the BJP take over the politics of caste in Tamilnadu
In Tamilnadu, it is said that if one cannot keep the threads clean, one cannot get rid of it, the BJP will finally put the caste politics in the hands of the BJP.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, he had to leave the Thamari in Tamil Nadu.
After this, for the second time, that is, during the Empire elections, she said, "You don't know what to do.
But in the 5 contested seats, only the soil was covered.
Though the BJP is all over the country, there is a wave of protest in Tamilnadu.
Above all, the imposition of Triple Talaq, Kashmir and Hindi is the only language.
Because of all this, we are still in a circumstance.
That's why BJP chief Sema is on the verge of administrators in Tamil Nadu, which is why it is said to be difficult to nominate even the state leadership.
On the one hand, the BJP plans to root out the BJP in Tamilnadu in any way in the coming assembly elections.
For this reason, the BJP leadership is supposed to have come to an end through direct field reports and intelligence reports.
Accordingly, there are two Dravidian parties, be it the Mahamukthi or the Divyang or the Divyang or the Divyang people that do not give enough importance to the people of the Nadar community, the Vanniers and the Debendra clan.
It is said that Dravidian parties are upset about this.
The BJP has started implementing this trick by hand.
It has decided to honour a position that gives importance to or glorifying the community.
Soondarajan's appointment as the governor of Telangana is similar.
Likewise, the BJP government is reportedly giving importance to the top ranking states in Israel.
It is true that if the BJP works to honour every race, it will be a matter of pride and happiness for the people of that race.
Moreover, one thing that does not fascinate in any respect will be concealed by the BJP in this caste politics.
At the same time, when Tamilnadu has already become a small minority in caste politics, it is not known if the BJP's actions are like adding more oil to the burning fire.
The truth is that if a caste fire starts to boil and flare up, the thread of the thread of Thamarai that has just flourished in Tamilnadu will boil in the same fire
