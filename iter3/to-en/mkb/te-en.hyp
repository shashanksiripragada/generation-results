Man Ki Batt , October 2019 .
And he said unto them , Nay , my beloved country .
Everyone has many ruins in the contribution of Deepavali .
It brings comfort, health and prosperity in the light of this world, which destroys antagonisms and visions of soundness.
Sahastra , Festival tourism is a special attraction of the world .
There are immense opportunities for the Festival in the national festivals of India.
Therefore, the role of Indians residing outside the country is vital in promoting festival tourism in India.
My beloved countrymen, we decided to do something new for this Deepavali in the last time of Mann Ki Baat .
On seeing this , innumerable stories were engraved in social meditation .
This day our brethren are in good professions.
She is really Indian Lakshmi .
Ramsh Garu , and your mother ' s name is Reiki .
Their power to Reiki poet Tiwari is Indian Lakshmi .
How pride he feels his cool paintings .
She brought a good rock in the CLAT test .
Megha Jain is coming , 92 years old ancient hill has provided water for travellers in the Gwalior railway station .
Meghaji has received so much support from the listening of this Indian Lakshmi .
Many such stories are Shering .
You must read, get sufficient.
You also make such things nearby you .
All these are my splendor of Indian Lakshmas . My beloved countrymen , in 17th century a poet was written in the language of Kannada at that time .
It is said that those emotions , those substances , Indian Lakshmis , now the foundation of all those who have told us is done there .
How important things , how important emotions , how important thoughts are poets in the eye .
Because of the magnificence of these archaeologists our society is the future of our society .
My beloved countrymen, on 12 November 2019, Shri Guru Nanak Devji will celebrate the 550th glimpse of the whole world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India but in the whole world .
In many countries of the world our Sikh brothers and sisters reside , they are completely unparalleled to the museum of Guru Nanak Devji .
I have never forgotten the journey done by the Gurudwara of Vancouver , Tehran Gurudwara .
I can tell you how much about Shri Guru Nanak Devji Regi, but it has to bear several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the highest place .
It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev Garhwal had done service with emotional emotions .
They were opposite to social illusions like unconsciousness .
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Garh has displayed his message from far off countries of the world .
They were one of the people traveling more during their time .
They went to many places, wherever they went, they spent their hearts with their ruthlessness, humility and simpleness.
Taking Sadbhavan , equal messages they went to all the sides of the north - east west in the east , everywhere people , saints , sages .
It is believed that the famous saint Shankar Dev of Assam also got supplemented with him.
They traveled the sacred Haridwar .
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
Sri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Rajgir, Gaya of Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev had traveled Sri Lanka .
During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During one Udasi, Guru Nanak Dev visited the neighbourhood of Kashmir in the North.
They traveled to Uzbekistan , wherever they were worshipped .
In a Udasi, he also undertaken major tours to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They are in the minds of lakhs of people who follow their teachings with complete devotion and devotion .
Approximately 85 countries have gone to Amritsar from Delhi to Amritsar .
The Golden Temple of Amritsar is visited there , Guru Nanak Dev Regiri 550 shining festival .
All these scholars there not only visit the Golden Temple , but also the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
Guru Nanak Dev Regiri is my opinion to bring their thoughts , ideal ideals in our life .
Then once I bowed my head and prayed to Guru Nanak Dev Reiki .
It is believed that my beloved brethren , October 31 you will definitely remember all of you .
If we read about the Sadar Saheb style , then how strong is their planning .
In order to participate in the Kangras Summit in Ahmedabad in 1921, thousands of representatives from all over the country have to come.
All the administrations of Samadhishwar were on the Sardar Patel .
He also used this opportunity to illuminate the network of water supply in the city.
Who has been organised without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be surprised to know that in the meeting place every person's things, shoes and shoes have been organised without stealing.
They were contacted with rails , made minerals .
At the same time the victory of Khadi was also shining .
For playing the role of Ulkhani in the state the Sardar Patel of our country has always been lost .
As if there is no chance of diversity occurring on the basis of Kullu , tradition they have done the main work of determining primary hiccups .
Sahastrara , India 's first hobbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbby is an important role of a great Bhagirathi , historical program .
You know very well the group of some islands of Lakshadweep .
After the division of India in 1947 our neighbouring country is on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Immediately after knowing this news of Sardar Patel he took difficult churches without losing time .
Start-up brothers, Arcot Ramswamy etc. and Arcot Lakshmanswamy said, "Travel Corps are flying with the people and the Trivandrum will first emerge in Lakshadweep.
Immediately with his country Trivarna had fled there , Lakshadweep had discovered all the neighbours of attacking Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I believe that these beautiful islands , sea shores will present you .
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Patel on October 31, 2018, has been dedicated to the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is double higher than the ' Statue of Liberty ' of America .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
On an average, about eight and a half thousand people visited the Statue of Unity every day.
Besides the belief of his mind , devotion of his mind , not only this , butterflies Garden , Gingal Safari , Childron New Yutension Park , many attractive centres like Centre , Centre , Centre are being developed .
Everyday, new opportunities are available to the people and the facilities of the tourists are being provided where the people of many villages are providing homes in their homes.
We are witness to the fact that within a year, how a place develops as a world famous tourist area.
People come from the country and abroad .
The government has played its role .
Brothers and sisters, Time Magazine in the midst of this cannot be proud of any Hindustani pride in the 100 major tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that all of you will be going to see the Statue of Unity after spending some time in your precious time.
Every Indian who wants to travel and travel in India, at least 15 tourist destinations in India will be associated with the family and I will always be requested to stay there for a night.
Brothers and sisters, you are aware that every year from October 31st, 2014 we are celebrating the International Day of Importance.
Today, we are conscious of the unity and integrity of our country in such situations.
On 31 October the Ran Far University is organised for the Ran Far University .
We have been looking at the last five years - apart from Delhi, a large number of women residents, villagers, children, youth, elderly, Divyangs are also joining in hundreds of cities in India, in the central areas, in the states, in the district centres, in the small tour-II towns.
Whatever is present in today 's time we are watching a zealous , jewellery on Marathon .
Run Fort University is also a special opportunity .
Running mind , brain is beneficial for body .
Therefore, not only the body but also the mind and culture, for India's unity, to take India to new heights.
Therefore you are in any city where you can know about Run Fort University nearby .
I believe that on 31st October India will definitely participate in the race for your fitness.
My beloved country residents , Sardar Patel sat in the influence of the country .
We will continue to strengthen the mantra of 'Ekta Mantra' in every possible way, in every turn, in every corner of the country with values like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been conscious and conscious to fulfil the mutual respect of the country.
If we see around us then many such examples are found, in which continuous work is being done to increase mutual interaction.
What kind of warriors try to defecate those situations according to their own benefits .
How many types of words were spoken to increase stress in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some scholars , important goals are not only known for their famous people who talk about themselves .
We remember how responsible things are talking .
But all this is going on for five days , seven days , ten days , but as soon as the judgment came , a joyous , surprising change has been seen .
On one side it has been done to increase the administration of two weeks , but on coming to Ramjanmabhoomi the government , political birds , social organizations , social society , social society , cultural heritage , cultural heritage , beauty has been exhibited .
Try to reduce stress in the environment .
But those days I remember very well now .
The dignity of the court has been acknowledged with pride, wherever there is no scope for exercising and heating.
These things should always be kept in mind that they give us strength .
Those days those symptoms , do us symptoms .
It is an example of how much energy gives the country to the country .
On the day of a big injury of the country .
I also dedicate my faith today .
My beloved countrymen , today the story of the household is listening to the story of every village , if the story of every village is heard from the north , from the east , from the east to the west , from the corners of Hindustan it is a clean story .
Every person , every family , every village wants to tell his pleasant experiences related to cleanliness because the efforts of cleanliness are hundred thirty crore Hindustan .
Their fruits are also an hundred and thirty crore Hindus .
There is an experience of a pleasant thrill .
Not only to separate garbage in it but also to organise that is a very important task .
In it , removing leaf on 130 tonnes around glacier , this is the very pleasant environment there , how big service is .
That is also the place of Ecosystem living in rare species of snow leopards where there are rare animals like Siachen species , sheep , wheat colored bears .
We all know that these Siachen rivers are the source of clean water, glaciers.
Therefore, the work of hygiene here means that people are using rivers like Nubra , Shyoke to clean the water from here to the lower areas.
My dear countrymen, the festival marks a new spirit in all our lives.
Otherwise Deepavali i . . specially buying some new object , much less in the family of every family .
I told once that we should try to buy locally available things .
If we get necessary things in our village then for that we do not have to go to Taluka .
Once again I tell you many ruins of this Deepavali festival in contact with this festival .
We are of various kinds of tomatoes for Deepavali .
But sometimes salt gets stuck by carelessness .
My many luxuries .
Thanks to many more .
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Nobody is proud to see our soldiers , our armed forces .
Every Indian soldier of any species , any place , religion or any language is always ready to bring their happiness , Madhuni .
All 125 crore Indians have celebrated the Parade and have recalled the Surgical Strike that took place in 2016.
During the war of paralysis on our country in the telescope , their unparalleled way our soldiers were given in the form of surgical strike .

In both the world wars happening in the twentieth century the soldiers of our country gave clean sacrifices for more than one lakh peace .
With the purpose of pancreasing in Shantibat it is a courage of our country soldiers .
India is also one of the largest number of soldiers sent to various peacekeeping forces of the United States.
The decades our soldiers are playing role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet .
O my beloved country , the sky is unique .
On the 8th day of October we celebrate the day of air conditioned team .
In 1932, the smallest Air Force contingent with six ladders, 19 soldiers etc. increased, which was one of the most brave and powerful air warriors in the 21st century.
In 1965 the Mughals of enemies had also given our air conditioned team .
Who knows about the independence of Bangladesh done in 1971 .
Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from the survival of Chorbat in 1999.
On the establishment of enemies in Tiger Hills night and night bombs made them soil .
The archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological importance of the country .

The woman becomes strong now armed now .
My beloved country , for a few days Christian Abhilash Tomi of our boating team has fighted with death for his life .
How to save him from the country of Yavat
You know that Kedar Abhilash Tomy is a very adventurous ruler .
Not using any kind of modern technique , only with the help of a small boat the Indian was the first Indian .
To participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern Indian ocean he is moving ahead in the sea for eighty days but the terrible sea storm has brought him difficulty .
But this team of India was spent fighting with many days in the sea .
He was the greatest example of adventure, resolve, heroism and he was a few days ago when he had saved him from the sea and brought him back to the sea, I spoke to him in the phone.
My beloved Deshpraja , how important is the second day of October , how important is our country .
This year October is a speciality of both .
From today onwards, we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi through various programs across the world.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have given the inspiration of the world .
In 1941 Gandhi Garh Museum started writing some thoughts in the form of a positive program .
Then in 1945 when he was breathing freedom fighting , he made the administration of his thoughts .
Puja Bapu rails , villages , workers have given their thoughts before the people of the country for protecting the rulers of education , cleanliness , education .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is a special identity of his personality .
Bapu had understood how important , important opportunity for the country .
Then thy doubt is being residing , thou feels as if thy bow is melting .
My beloved country , this mantra of Gandhi Garhwal is still special .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , shopping power is increasing .
When we go to buy something we remember the worshipping Bapu once , we remember this mantra which he had said .
Because of shopping these things I give benefit to any powder in the country .
Who has enjoyed happiness in Mughals .
This is his message . I believe that in the life of the poorer , weaker person you can bring a great change in your life .
It is said that my beloved countrymen , cleanliness , freedom will be obtained .
Because he does not know but India has come to India .
For example , because of shopping in special cases many people have helped the workers of Khadi , fishing products .
All these Khadi clothes are also so difficult but they are not made , they are used each other .
Looking very humble from outside , there was a scientific destination like mountain from inside , Lal Bahadur Shastri .
"Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" is a fine display for the great personality of the food scientific literature.
And he gave a mantra to the soldiers of the country , and to the soldiers of the country , and to the soldiers of the country .
My beloved countrymen , it is common to talk about cleanliness while remembering the worshipping child .
September fifteen ' Cleanliness Service ' started a campaign .
Millions of people participated in this programme and I also got the opportunity to pay homage to the children at the Ambedkar School in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself laid the foundation of that school .
People of all classes of the country participate in the contribution of this September on fifteenth September .
Let us see a phone call. "Greetings
Thank you specially for your phone call.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention i. e.
With the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu on the second day of October, 2018, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded.
Adventurous , physiotherapy , bored people want to give freedom , peace , justice , it is specially important .
Several places have been done for the primary hiccups in the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
Inspired by them, on October 12, 1993, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established.
In a few days NHRC has completed the packets .
NHRC has not only saved human rights but has also worked to increase the pride of our people.
Our Chief, our beloved, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji clearly stated that human rights are not for us.
In the symbol of our national human handicraft the ideal museum of Vaishali is unparalleled for ' Bhagwan ' .
NHRC has made an extensive necessity for humans, with which the role of hiccups has also been played to stop the use of these hiccups.
In this journey of feet NHRC has made a belief , a belief environment in the country .
It is my belief that for a healthy society, for the best democracy, this is a big event.
In the national level of Italy along with the work of humans in the national level the commission of humans of twenty six countries has also been established .
In a society, we have to make an effort to understand the rights of human beings and to bring them into the courtyard. This is the basis of the idea of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' - 'Progress for All'.
My beloved country , in the month of October , in the month of October , Jai Light Narayan Registration is the Jayanti of Rajmata Vijayraj Scindia Registration starts in this month .
I will describe them in Raboe Man Ki Baat but I will surely propose this proposal . In the last few days Dindi Saheb Jayanti on 31 October 31 November , the ' Ran Fort University ' is being organised in every big cities of India .
This time also we make an attempt to make this ' Ran Fort University ' in every small city , areas , villages .

This is the direct devotion of giving us to him .

At the same time science , education , students have impressed your contribution .
My beloved countrymen , this rainy season brings many hopes to our farmers for their hard work .
The dried trees , plants , dried rivers with strong sunshine .
But sometimes this rainy season also brings luxury , destroying floods .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains are raining .
The destructions leaving behind them are unforgettable .
But on occurrence of dangers humanity meaning what we understand .
We all know that the soldiers of the soldiers of the soldiers running in Kerala are the officers of the soldiers .
They did n't leave anything in protecting those stuck in floods .
No matter how big role has been played in the efforts of air force , but not navel , army , BSF , CISF , RAF , everybody has played an important role in the attempts of protection .
I would especially like to mention about the hard work done by NDRF and how excellent help they have been in such a difficult situation.
The efforts made by NDRF to keep their competence, their competency and effective decisions are a matter of concern for every Indian.
Ninna Oman Festival.
In order to come out quickly from this danger we pray that the state of Kerala is not able to give strength to this festival of Kerala , especially the state of Kerala , we pray that the archaeological development of Kerala is fast .
I say that the people of Kerala , the people of the country are with them all the other places of the country , the whole country is with them .
My beloved countrymen , this time I am seeing the informations coming for Man Kei Bath .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swan Berji from West Bengal, Akhilash Pandey from Katihar in Bihar etc.
On the sixteenth day of August the mortality rate of the Atlantic death of August is drowned in the temporary world of the country .
The fourteen years old is the chief captain of the country , which left the eleventh day .
If you want to say one way then the last teeth went away from the royal palaces .
People have made him the best parlor civilization , a pleasant acquaintance , a great dear leader .
Due to the reason of bringing in the reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive organs the country has already fallen .
Our thanks to Atal Ji for the 91st State Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment has brought two main changes in the royal palaces of India .
First change is that in the number of mantras in the states the number of mantras in the number of states is fifteen percent .
The guide changed it .
That is why the wildlife had become alright .
Therefore the consciousness has increased .
Due to the point of view of Atal Register these conditions have changed and healthy traditions have started increasing in our political culture .
Atal guide is a true country .
Change has been changed while entering the budget in their administration .
Initially , according to the tradition of the British , during the time of parliament in London , it used to enter the market in the evening .
In 2001 Atal guide changed the time of five in the evening , eleven in the morning .
In the same way you are watching the churches of the states , central governments once in the country .
It is a good option for delivery .
Healthy democracy , giving excellent democracy , beauty of good traditions , to make the democracy of democracy , to make the democracy of democracy , to give all the churches , etc . also give us the best devotion .
The work of Lok Sabhavahan is an hundred and eighteen percent , the work of the state has remained seventy four percent .
The Monsoon Session of Parliament reminds us of social justice and youth development seminars.
Several important girls who use the youth and the backward classes have been adopted in these events.
Like the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade is also a desire to make a commission .
To ensure the powers of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled its commitment to appoint the Open Commission this time.
It has also given the authority of a state . social judgment which takes forward .
That is why parlor has entered hard training by entering the parlor of parlor .
According to this not only the iniquities doing illusions but also the education of education of education , girls in twelve girls are executed .
A few days ago, you might have read in the newspapers, a judgement in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, after just two months of inquiry, sentenced two offenders to death in the case of a girl child.
Earlier, in a court in Kathani, Madhya Pradesh, after just five days of inquiry, the guilty were executed.
Even in Rajasthan the judges there have taken some such fast decisions .
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness occurring on women , girls .
We can bring changes in the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the oppressed.
In the rainy season everybody has kept an ideal ideal place .
The parlor of the country is telling thanks to all the members of the parlor of the country .
My beloved country , these days the eyes of crores of people are on Asia creeds happening in Jakarta .
Asia is still happening .
I told all the sports meditations meditation for the country .
India is a fit and a bright future of India is created.
I am telling you that in Asia the second time the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibition of the exhibitions of the exhibition of the exhibitions of the exhibitions of the exhibitions of the exhibitions of the exhibitions of the exhibitions of the exhibitions of the exhibitions of the exhibitions of the exhibition
Everybody 's national year is spectacular .
Besides this the whole country also remembers him with great pride , spirituality .
In his memory September is celebrated as the fifteenth honey of the engineers .
The engineers of our country walking in their steps have published their own identity in the world .
It is called Bhug in Kutch .
This house has been seen three earthquakes .
But if you see any harm at any place .
Our ancestors of this house have been built according to the environment here .
It has been said pride that after listening to it I felt that before centuries the engineers of that time , according to the local conditions , normal people living safely .
Now while celebrating the engineer destination we should also think about our future .
Keep work shops at every place .
In changing times we want to learn some new things .
What should be taught to students
Let's meet again.
In the midst of this place rains are coming properly .
At some places maximum rains are also coming to the architects .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of no rains .
Natural opposite to nature is human .
That is why sometimes nature comes on us .
Therefore the responsibility of protecting nature is our responsibility .
Twelve Junior Football players in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour .
Normally it takes a few hours to come out in that cave .
But the decision of that day is another way .
On not getting out any way they were left near a small pocket situated inside the cave .
Not in one or two days , but in one or eighteen days the same way was left .
On one side they are fighting with obstacles , on the other hand the human species of the world has displayed the price of human species .
World worldwide people prayed to come out safely for these children .
Those children who get stuck , in what situation they are in , to know all possible attempts have been made .
How to take out the water if it is not possible to save them in time then it is impossible to bring them out for the rainy season .
Unfortunately they enjoyed everybody 's beauty , as soon as they came safely .
But I considered how this protection program was done from the other point of view .
The responsible responsibility found in every level is marvellous .
Government , children , parents , their family members , media , people of the country , everybody has also been seen marvellously .
In this entire behavior one of the Jawans of Dhai Land had also lost their lives .
Keeping mind on our goal with cosmetic , stable mind it is enough to work .
After some days the favorite poet of our country had left us .
Our Indians can also give how much strength to the Niraj Record every time , inspiration .
This is the time of the start of the art galleries .
The youngsters who come here in July ask for the most important part of their life where they turn from their point of view to cut-off .
The meditation of students changes from home to hospital.
The students come under the shadow of professor from the shadow of parents .
I believe that my young friends keep keeping their life very happy , enthusiasm , enthusiasm .
This is the time when you will have to make yourself capable of getting out of your house , going out of your city for the first time , separating from a solid atmosphere .
How many youths leave their house for the first time , come out to give a new direction to their life .
I have told everyone that stay calm , spend life , enjoy your mind completely in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But taking new friends , mixing friends , keeping those friends standing this is a very knowledgeable task .
New experts , new languages .
The student of one famous family of Madhya Pradesh had successfully crossed all the difficult competitions of his life .
Jodhpur AIMS has conducted victory in the first attempt of MBS test .
His father was able to fulfil his family by doing the work of comprehensive work .
My beloved country , for a few days Christian my eyes attracted a archaeological archaeologically associated with two youths .
If we read inside then it has been told that our youth technology has been trying to bring change in the life of a normal person .
In America once I am celebrating with Indian youths once in Sanjoj city called technology Habgah .
I wanted to think about how we can use everybody for India and do something for the country.
Use of their professional experts both of them have made a memorial ypnotise .
Apart from meeting the people of this village with the youth world they have to give any advice to Gony , information about their own mobile which has been available in their own mobile .
In a way, an attempt has been made to bring digital revolution in this Yap Village and it is easier to record, track and monitor the development work done in the village.
In this Yap, there are phone directory, news department, awareness programmes, health centres and information centres in the village.
In order to know the FACT ratio among the rural features of this Yap, the marketplace will be useful for their production.
If you look at this thing with certainty then one thing is understood - those youngsters are leading their lives in America, in the midst of the lifestyles and thoughts of America and even after leaving India for so many years, they have been psychologically impressed with the smaller things of their village and they have been psychologically impressed with their villages.
That is why they can do anything properly in the village .
Situated in its roots , this relation with its roots , for the country there is a penance , every Indian in every Indian .
But sometimes because of time , because of distant situations , a thin dust named on it . but if someone is touched with a small coal then all the internal things come up again .
Pandarpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
One fifteen-twenty days before Akadeshi, Varkari means pilgrims, palanquins, along with Pandarpur pilgrimage.
This journey is called War . in which devotees participate in lacs of numbers .
Gyaneshwar , Tukaram etcetera keep the feet of great saints in the palanquin , Vithal , Vithal , dancing , dancing , walking on foot on foot .
Pilgrims or Vithoba or Pandurang reach there for visiting Lord Vithal .
Lord Vithal Bhagwan protects the lice , burps , victims by doing good .
Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana people have unparalleled faith , devotion .
Going to the Vithoba Temple in Pandarpur, the glory, beauty and spiritual joy is a special experience.
If possible then I want to feel the experience of Portuguese Waterfall once .
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdeva, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram etc. are still punishing ordinary people in Maharashtra.
Their main folk music is Bharud or Abhang which we get the message of Sadbhav , love , beauty .
Because of this the society of foolish beliefs is available to fight against the society .
The power to see their wrong rulers of the British rulers is in him .
The British were so afraid that in twenty years he tried to ignore Rajdroh thrice .
This is not a small thing .
An interesting incident about the idol of Tilak located in Lokmanya Tilak, Ahmedabad is associated with the people of the country.
He said that during the death of Lokmanya Tilak Gadh on 1920 AD his memorial statue was installed in Ahmedabad .
Sardar Vallabhai Patel Ahmedabad city was selected for the memorial of his world Tilk Resort for the memorial of his world Victoria Garden which is known as the Garden of Britain .

The instruments in the midst of this also increase their intelligence even more .
This technique is useful for glittering the lice , badhis , essential life of those people .
Is it possible to get any help from the Artificial Intelligence to make the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier in this programme
For a few days, along with the Prime Minister of Israel, I got the opportunity to visit Ahmedabad in Gujarat for the inaugural year of I Create.
There a young man made a digital result .
I believe that Artificial Intelligence can be used in many ways.
The price of science and technology is stable .
There is no price for them .
Every instrument we want to work only as we want .
But by the instrument we do any work which depends on us .
Here the goal of human goal is main .
Science should not only be used for human welfare , but also for stopping the best peaks of human life .

I am telling all our scientists , scientists , scientific people associated with national science .
Friends , at the time of obstacles I keep coming many times on subjects like security , distortion etc . people keep coming to me something or the other .
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion of the Occupational Safety in Pune.
He said that Safety standards are not very important in our country where factory and construction work is being done.
The fourth day of March is the National Safety Day, therefore, Prime Minister has asked to take some precautions about Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat programme, he added.
In daily life we are not able to take precautions , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get disturbed during obstacles .
If concentration is reduced, there is a danger - one destruction causes destruction - pleasure ends with laughter - to enhance emotional bonds - do not play with emotionality - do not lose life, do not lose life.
By crossing that path one can not use all times in our life .
But if natural opposite opposite opposite , more dangers occur due to our layer .
We are very good, taking necessary precautions, not only saving our lives but also protecting our society from big dangers.
There are many informations about Bhadrata at one time but nobody participates them properly .
I want to make microscopic drill in front of the children of various schools once in a week with fire dynasty situated in metropolitan cities .
This country has faced many chemical , industrial accidents of nature , human creations .
These are the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which is manufacturing major seeds in the country.

Training , very important role is the main role .
Two-three-three-thirds i. e.
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to heat ascending in the same way the number of deaths occurring due to heat ascending is 220 .
That is why we know that we are giving importance to Bhadrata , we can be safe .
If there is such an obstacle in the society then I would like to congratulate the innumerable people, social incidents and the best citizens in the program of help in minutes.
Under the leadership of India, all countries with the name of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal etc. have done a joint disaster management exercise.

They should be part of our life .
Normally we keep on traveling in airplanes many times . Air hostels are giving information about Bhadrata in the beginning of air travel .
All these informations are also listening to us many times .
But if someone takes us in the airways , where is life jacket , how to use it , then I can definitely say that nobody can say properly .
The opportunity to see them clearly .
That's it.
But we pay attention .
Therefore, while sitting in the air, we hear the cautiousness of our ears but we feel that they are telling our wishes.
We consider every hole of life like that .
We should not consider this Bhadrata not for us .
If all of us are very best for our Bhadrata then the society is also international in it .
My dear countrymen, this time, in the budget, we have started a programme by keeping in mind the importance of creating wealth from waste to energy for villages under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
GOBAR-Dhan meaning Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
Besides cleaning the villages, making the name of animals more sensitive, COMPOST, BIO-GAS, the goal of GOBAR-Dhan is to produce wealth and energy through them.
The number of animals in India is approximately 30 crore whose lice is produced three lakh tonnes .
Some European countries , Chinese animals , remaining of the animals , others produce energy of vanity .
But in India it is not useful in complete condition .
The Swachh Bharat Mission is now moving forward in this direction.
A goal has been set for producing bio-gas based energy from the waste produced from animal dung , sensitive vegetation , etc. .
Under the Gobardhan Yojana, rural India has to be encouraged to see licensing brothers and sisters in rural India not only in terms of licensing but also through ensuring wealth.
The health of animals becomes shining , their production increases .
Because of bio gas , lighting cosmetic energy increases in the matter of energy .
This technique is helpful in increasing the custom of roses , animals .
New gardens increase for vegetation , transport , cerebral selling , etc .
To move the blessedness of Gobar blessing a necessity trekking platform is also made which is connected with rails , shopping .
I would like to urge the businessmen, especially the brothers and sisters living in rural areas to come forward and make arrangements for self-help groups and collaborations.
I would like to invite you to participate in the Clean Energy and Green jobs and ask you to turn the villages into vain, to make Gobar-Dhan.
My dear countrymen, till now we have heard about many types of festivals like music festival, food festival, film festival etc.
But in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first ever Vaishali Mahotsav was organised by a special effort.
The objective behind this festival, which was started by the Raipur Municipal Corporation, is to create awareness about the various aspects of cleanliness and not to make use of vains in the city creatively.
Each of the students participated in various programmes organised in the Festival.
Inspired from Raipur in some remaining districts also vain festivals have been done in various ways .
Every seventh March is celebrated on the eighth day of the international women .
Many programs are organized in our country , worldwide .
That is, we are talking about the development of women-led development by moving ahead from women's age.
In this context, I am reminded of the words written by Swami Vivekananda - The idea of perfect womenhood is perfect intelligence - the idea of Swami Vivekananda a century ago expresses the spirit of Nari Shakti in Indian culture.
In the tradition of recognizing women we were participating in the tradition of women . Yashodananda , Kausalya Nanda , the son of Gandhari , this was the identity of every son .

Opening memories like Lopamudra , Gargi , Matrai .
It is a long time ago that in our scientific and sensitivity, we are proposing to save a child, read a girl, but in our scientific ways, what is said in the scriptures, i. e.

This time after seeing the parade of Ganesha day many people came to recognize the main estimation of their past by the Twitzer , other social meditations .
The view of this adventurous use has also surprised all the guests coming to the country and abroad .
This is a form of women 's power , self confidence .
These are playing the nervous system of our women .
They are changing .
One more thing has come to me that our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have seen an important example.
In the matter of tribal women i . . a special picture is seen in everyone 's mind . in which the weight of binoculars tied on the heads is seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture of the country .
In the Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, maoists have created a terrible environment with violence, atrocities, bombs, tempests.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this - tuberculosis .
At some time some women met it .
Therefore three benefits are being taken . on one side self-confidence has made them healthy .
Leave it in our hands , accept changes in important places .
Repeated himself is the speciality of our society .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been found in our heritage .
For some days Christian Bihar has taken an interesting new wave program .
The biggest human chain of the world has been seen to be more than thirteen thousand kilometres away from the evil methods of the state .
Through this program people have already become opposite to marriages , vertebral illusions .
The whole state has contributed to fight against the ill effects of child marriage , vertebrae , vertebrae etc .
Children , elders , enthusiasm full of enthusiasm , mothers , sisters , everybody participate in this fight .
From the historical Gandhi plateau of Patna , etc . this human harmony connects people with the borders of the state .
If there is proper development of all people in the society then the society should be freed from evil methods like this .
Come , let us all think that such evil methods are removed from the society .
A New India will build a strong, efficient India.

After knowing about the centres of reproductive medicines started buying medicines there , the expense of his medicines decreased 75 percent .
The medicines available in the centres of reproductive medicines are available in the market for fifty percent of the branded medicines available in the market .
That is why common people , especially medicines get so economic help for old age .
Due to this reason good quality medicines are available in less price .
Three thousand medicine centres have been established in the whole country of Italy .
Therefore besides getting medicines cheap there is also a chance of the people who do their own business .
Medicines at cheap prices become the practice of ' Amritsar Stores' in the Indian Prime Minister's Jan Aushadhi Kendras and in the hospitals.
The objective of the scheme is to ensure a healthy and prosperous India by providing affordable healthcare services to every elite citizen of the country.

Through this survey the cleanliness system organised in cities is estimated in the cleanliness of the city or the life style of people .
Cleanliness is not only the government .
This is also a big responsibility of every Pauri , every project .
During the days of coming everybody participates in this survey of Jagbuary everybody with enthusiasm .
In this surveillance, you must strive hard without your city, your place, your streets.
It is my belief that to make use of blue color , green colored leafy vegetables separated from wet garbage of your house , dry garbage of your house is a good habit of all of you now .
Reducing poison , using again , repeated use is very beneficial .

Due to decades Muslim women have done unrighteousness but no church has happened .
There is no rule of this rule in many epidemic countries .
But Muslim women of India do not have this power .
Our government has made me very happy to pay attention to this thing .
Usually Haj pilgrims are permitted through latrine method but it is my belief that women alone are kept away from this latrine method.
Our women should also get equal power in comparison to men. In the progress they also need to make equal efforts to walk with men.

In some houses sweets are spoiled , in some houses children are made for sweets .
At least we have more things in our houses , we should definitely get the habit of paying attention to things that are not necessary .
They reach all these things by adopting clothes , sweets , food etc . from the people .
The players in our culture are considered as Lakshmi because the girls are enriched with the point of view of view of girls .
This time we will organise the program of pride of playing children in our society , villages , cities .

My dear countrymen, December 5th is World Soil Day.
This conclusion I want to say some things with my Ratu brother , Association .
The most important part of the earth is soil .
The substances which we eat are contacted with this soil .
The whole food chain is soiled in one way.
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life possible .
How can it be possible to live animals .
This is the reason why we are at the forefront of the ancient times of soil.
In our culture, on the one hand, there have been attempts to create a feeling of devotion to the people of fruits, soil and on the other hand, some scientific methods have become a part of our lives.
Our soil is devotion, scientific soil conservation and conservation both are important in the lives of the farmers of this country.
In our country the rails are drowned with tradition , to show interest in modern science , to make an attempt , to make us pride .
I have heard about the farms of Tohu village and Bhoraj Black in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
It is said that some rails of the village after considering the situation of poisonous toxins were done at present , some kinds of red , microbes , microbes , microbes , syndrome were advised .
After that you will be surprised to hear the results .
At the same time the soil has also glittered in the necessity of soil .
If we want to think about the fruit then precaution should be taken care of the landslide , if we save the earth , then we have also come to know that our rails have also come to know .
All our residents across the country understand their soil very well, according to which they have taken soil health cards over ten crore.
We worship the earth but how much the health of the earth becomes desolate with red race .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that due to the necessity of more than required .
Global Warming , changes in the environment , all of us are experienced .
Sometimes in front of Deepavali the winter season has come to December gradually gradually .
But as soon as the winter starts, we do not want to come out of the grapes, this is an experience for all of us.
Everyday going to 30,40 homes and telling about cleanliness this child has got relief from excretion in Kumhari village .
In the direction of increasing cleanliness the small child has done how inspirational work .
There is no diference between the age of cleanliness , there is no limit .
Children , elderly , women , men , cleanliness is important for everyone .
How important is it to do everybody for cleanliness .
Our Divya brother , Sodrimans were strong .
Scientists , adventurous adventurous games .
They can learn something or the other every moment .
These are coming in every hole .
Our Divya brothers do not take any social problems in the year .
You will remember that in the Rio Olympics, our Divyang sportspersons displayed a unique sport and won four medals.
The blind T20 is standing in the world camp .
Different kinds of competitions keep on happening in the country .

Do not forget the face, do not forget the happiness, do not forget the grief as the elders and the elders of our villages have said.
In our country too, an attempt is made to recall the interesting events of the past year in the media.
Pay attention to others giving inspiration .
If you want to pay good things , then the mind of good works .
It gives strength to do good things .
The place of this mixture is energy , its effects should be seen all of us together .
In the coming mind, I will definitely try to give all the people of the country the things that have come into this positive state.
My beloved country , the month coming , I will come between you with word in the mind of coming .
On the second time there is a chance of telling many bubbles .
Man Kei Bath : Talking in mind .
Special festival this festival is completely celebrated with nature , nature worshipped this festival .
During this worship of sun , water , water is worshipped . vessels , soil utensils , bamboo etc . are different items engraved with these worships .
In this festival full of beliefs the message of sunrise , stopping sunset is filled with a special culture .
It is said that if the world is worshipping them , it is necessary to assimilate them in this church then worshipping Chhath Puja tells us .
This festival is also said to be so important for the public in our life .
In front of this festival people also clean the banks of Patu , river , lake , worshipping river with great enthusiasm .
It is natural to consider this important tradition of India everybody pride .
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat among the people, my belief is that the word in my mind has become a hundred percent stronger bond with the countrymen.

I also got the opportunity to see a game .
I am telling my opinions , hustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle-bustle .
My beloved countrymen, how many people are coming to me about Swachh Bharat , if I want to judge all those opinions then I have to make a programme in my mind everyday.
If you send photographs of small children , then there are stories of young hair attempts at another place .
If there is some creative observation related to cleanliness at one place , then there is a news about changes occurring with some authority at the other place .
A few days Christian report has given me a very expansive report in which there is a story of the resurrection of Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra .
There, an NGO Vrindavan Chandrapur Fort, called the Ecological Protection Organization, has undertaken a cleanliness programme.
In this program running for two hundred days people did not get tired , not tired , the cleanliness program was run by standing in a hair .
Walking for two hundred days .
Before the program , after that photographs were sent me .
The attempt of this Bhagirathi done for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty , community , for ever .
The forts are our heritage symbols .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe , clean is of all the people of the country .
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Chandrapur for the Ecological Protection Organisation.
O my beloved country , on the fourth day of November , on the fourth day of November we celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti .
Guru Nanak Garhwal is also the first Guru of the Sikhs , Jagat Guru .
All the species of T . . have been seen together for their entire human campaign .
Women have given importance to pride , women pride .
Guru Nanak had travelled twenty-eight thousand kilometers on foot and gave a message about the true humanity of this journey.
They were talking to the people , truth , temporary path .
In the society, the message has been given about equality and not only through words but also through his work.
Guru Nanak Garh has also discovered Gurubani to speak his words .
In the year 2019 we are celebrating the 550th year of Guru Nanak Register .
Come , we try to move ahead on their message road .
My beloved countrymen , after two days we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31 October .
All of us know that the foundation of modern India is the foundation of India .
With the extraordinary journey of the great child of India we can learn how much .
On 31 October 31 Mrs . Indira Gandhi had left this procedure .
And he said unto them , It is the same thing that he is able to do counsel .
The palanquins standing on the one side of India have been displayed by the Sadar Baalbhai Patel .
Crores of Indians made an attempt to bring India under one country , under one state .
Their decision has given them the power to face all obstacles .
Where there is need of psychological importance there works with psychological power .
Where there is need of strength , it is there .
He decided a goal that he went ahead with complete artificial artificial artificially .
This program which is done in the country can be done by week .
Everybody has imagined the country like that .
I want their words to be inspiring for all of us:- We should not stop the gap between our mothers.
This story of Sardar Saheb is also inspiring and relevant for our New India vision.
Because of this reason their Jayanti is celebrated on the Important day of the country .
In giving an unparalleled form of the country their support is unparalleled .
My beloved countrymen , after Deepavali Shells , with new information , with new decision , you have started once in your daily life .
All the people of my generation want to wish all their dreams , hustle-bustle .
Through the sky you all spent three times while talking to your mind .
These are the words of the mind of 36th .
I have never said these things in my heart .
And it came to pass , when I had spoken in this mind , that the people of the country had sent me away from all the four corners of the country .
There is a lot of inspiration in them .
There is a change in many governments .
Some personal fibers are like the point of view of some social problems .
Once in a month, I take your time for half an hour but people keep on talking about it in their minds for 30 days in a month.
That is why the journey of three-three times in this mind is the journey of all the people of the country , feelings , feelings .
I tell all the people of the country to give me thanks to understand the common feelings of India in such a short time .
Now three times have been fulfilled therefore social scientists , university scientists , researchers , media specialists definitely take up their position .
But in the future of such positive churches how much useful is the mind in the future , a good memory , new enthusiasm .
After that I told me that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths have done such works before .
Leaving food in Kanchenjunga , how many people think that how many people were able to use it , how much happy I had enjoyed my joy .
Once I saw a serpent's photo of Selfie with Daughter in Haryana, I told everyone about it in my heart.
On seeing, not only in one India but in the whole world, a big initiative called 'Selfie with Daughter' has been started.
This is not only a subject of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self-confidence in every girl .
Everybody felt that parents should take selphy with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , it has been believed that it has its own importance .
A few days ago I am sitting in the tourism department of India .
If you are going to the journey there then incredible India -LRB- unparalleled India -RRB- then we sent photographs there .
Then lakhs of paintings from different parts of India, in a way, have been a big contribution for all those working in the tourism sector.
I felt as a small incident that how big adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous game .
As soon as the thought of the completion of three years came , many incidents were glittering in my heart .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the welfare of the society and for the progress of the country.
It was learnt and heard from the people of the country as part of my three-day Mann Ki Baat programme.
This is the biggest power of any country , which is the biggest energy of any country .
I worship the heart of all the people of the country .
Once I talked about Khadi in my mind that Khadi was not a cloth but a thought.
Discounts are given in Khadi girls about October and a lot of reduction is received .
I want to increase this Khadi procedure in such a way .
Increasing interest in the Khadi sector has also increased the enthusiasm of those working in the Khadi sector and those associated with the Khadi in the Government of India.
How to bring new technologies , how to increase the yield , how to bring the handicrafts of cosmetics to work , how to revive the ancient tradition of 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years after being closed , etc .
Many people have been produced .
Resumed the training centre of closed Khadi and rural industries in Penthore, Kashmir, which has a lot of work to provide for this sector.
In the beginning of the training centre, I am very happy to select new generations in the construction of new generations, in the direction of new things and in the middle of this big corporate institutions to give me a lot of pleasure.
People also began to choose Khadi objects while giving gifts to each other .
Some things naturally moved ahead in the experience of all of us .
My beloved countrymen, in the month of Christ, we decided to celebrate the Cleanliness Festival for the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti.
Our honorable president Garud started this program .
Children , elders , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been participated in the proposal of all these .
As I said that I am able to meditate , we are looking forward in front of the eyes .
Everybody has adopted this procedure , to help it , to make it successful .
That is why the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery of the jewellery is told .
Along with them every class of the country is also considered to be their own work . Everybody has contacted this proposal .
They, students, schools, art galleries, universities, railways, coolies, coolies, polices, children, jawans and everybody got associated with this.
If these places are garbage then people are not able to swallow food and this pressure is also seen in those who work there .
It is very good that more than seventy five lakh people, more than forty thousand people participated in the programme in the four days of Swachhta Seva.
Some consequences are continuously working with the goal of showing results .
Once again, we have seen a new thing - one bedroom programme, the other beds are being cautious.
If you want to change cleanliness in a natural way , Bhavodavgadh is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by cleaning service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have been made pictures .
The pictures about cleanliness with their own imagination .
I will never forget the blessedness of the media when the word of Absalom came .
We are watching the cleanliness serving of electronic media, print media and the country in our country.
In the midst of this meditation somebody told me about the young man of the thirteenth century Billa Dar of Srinagar .
It is said that for the administration of Srinagar Portuguese this Billa Darbar has made his brand Ambassador i . . Brand Ambassador i . . Hero of Sini Rang .
Not only this .
Billa Dar had paid attention to his twelve-three years of age , past five feet cleanliness .
He is the inspiration of all those who are zealous in the age of age .
I offer many congratulations to Billa Dar.
We have to confess that my beloved country , future history , past history .
This time Nanaji Redi , Pundit Din Dayal Redident is also the year of the century .
Do not know what is the center of all these great men
A common thing situated in everyone is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
The guide of the face of Nanaji country was engraved in the work of royal life , leaving the life of the village , it is natural to have the pride of their village program .
The President of India, Shri Abdul Kalla, used to talk to the youth about the development of Nanaji Desh Mukhgiri village every time.
Like Mahatma Gandhi Regiri the guests of Din Dayal were also talking about the person sitting in the last floor of the society .
We should also run for any unity , oneness mantra ahead .
The unity in diversity is normally said to be the speciality of India .
We pride the diversity but do you ever try to feel this diversity .
The nearest airport of Deepavali is at a distance of some place in the country .
Going to every tourist is a common thing .
But it is a matter of anxiety that people do not see our country and do not know the diversity of the country.
Our country is full of many options .
All these Mahabharatas have also been developed in the country .
Before starting this work an attempt has been made to understand the country of Bharat .
There is an attempt to fill India in itself .
My own experience is that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
I got the opportunity to spend night in more than four hundred districts .
I would like to not only condemn the unity in diversity but also to feel the country of this vast India and our indomitable energy.
One India - the best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power of our country tourism .
My request is that you want to go out somewhere on your holidays , changes should be understood , understand what should be understood , learn that you should go out with the purpose of learning .
Watch India inside you .
Your life will be enriched by these experiences .
Your thought will be large .
There are more milk for experienced experiences .
Normally from October to March is good for more tourism .
Definitely send your photo in the incredible incredible .
You can also send pictures of humans connected with the place where you go .
Not only the identification of construction , but also come about the life styles there besides natural beauty .
Can you put in the incredible
You see, everybody from one state has discovered from the beauty of the state and I will have to make publicity about the seven places that have come in it.
The Government of India works on them .
The government will adopt information about pictures , video , propagation , propagation , encouragement of them from you , how many places beauty from you .
Come , walk with me .
You can also become a big source of encouragement to use the time of March in the month of October , to encourage the tourism of the country .
I am inviting you .
My beloved country , many things like a man meet me .
My mind recognizes the mosquitoes .
I leave a deep effect on my mind .
No matter how much I am yourself .
Why does Asaman say that while serving India their husbands are not heaven .
We can imagine how their condition becomes alright in small age .
Along with eleven months she trained her life to make her husband dreams .
Although the husband of Nidhi Dibbe had forgotten the death by working in the army of Mukhsh Dubey .
His wife also reached in the army by reaching in the army .
Every Indian is natural to have the pride of this maternal power , our gloriousness of these ventilators .
I am telling many hustle-bustle-bustles with the heart of these two sisters .
He gave new inspiration , new excitement to the fort of the country .
These two sisters were impossible .
My beloved country , Navratri festivals , Deepavali festivals have a big opportunity for the youth of our country .
The FIFA Under-17 World Cup is being held in our country.
It is believed that the sounds of football keep on moving around .
Every generation the zeal of foot balcony is increasing .
In any school of India there is no youth playing football in the art gallery .
My beloved country , Navratri festival is celebrated .
Durga Devi is worshipped .
The environment is sacred , aromatic .
On all four sides spiritual environment , festival , environment full of devotion .
It is considered as the festival of Shakti .
These are also called Sharda Navratri . Till now the calmness starts .
O my beloved country , worship ye Sadar .
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand it is natural to worry about the country when there are positive news from some corner of India.
This is the country of the birthplace of Sardar Patel for the IIDS of the country of Buddha , the birthplace of Gandhi .
The ' Ahisa ' religious ' . we came to hear it while listening to it .
I also said from the Red Fort - there is no persecution in the name of beliefs, but it is a traditional belief, it is the belief of political ideology, it is the belief of a person, it is the traditional belief.
According to the kingdom given us Baba Saheb Ambedkar , every person has all kinds of arrangements for judgment .
I say to the people of the country that they were taking the chatti in their hands , who were a person , they were a group , they would not be able to bear this country .
Our festivals are also full of many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of thousands of years we get a heritage , cultural traditions , social traditions , historical events , everything , therefore in the year some day there is no festival .
All our festivals also keep on coming according to nature .
Everything is directly related to nature .
Jain society is celebrated every year .
Jain society is celebrated in the month of Bhadrapad .
Festival of men is celebrated on the last day of the year .
Actually this is a unique tradition .
The festival of annual festival is a symbol of forgiveness , non-vegetarian feelings .
My beloved countrymen , today everybody of the country is celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi festival with grandeur .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to come to the matter of Bahrang - Ganesh Festival .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak ji, 125 years ago, gave birth to this tradition and the last 125 years were symbols of freedom.
After independence they stand symbol of social education , social consciousness .
Ganesh Chaturthi festival is celebrated for ten days .
This festival is said to be a symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
The contribution of Ganesh festivals for all the residents of the country is many ruins .
Now Om festival is celebrated in Kerala .
In the colorful festivals of India Omam of Kerala is a major festival .
This festival tells social , cultural heritage .
Onam festival exhibits the important cultural heritage of Kerala .
This festival inspires new enthusiasm, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and compassion in the society.
Now our festivals also change their attractions of tourism .
Navratri festivals in Gujarat, Durga Puja festivals in Bengal have become their attraction in a way.
Our other festivals are also useful for attracting foreigners .
In that direction we should think what we can do .
In the tradition of these festivals in a few days the festival of Eid-ul-uha is celebrated .
Many congratulations and best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festival meaning belief is a symbol of faith .
Festivals in the Navbharata country should be made symbol of cleanliness .
This is not new for us but changing it into a social habit .
Cleanliness is not only in the house but also in the entire village, in the city, in the city, in the state, in our country, cleanliness and cleanliness should be made a special part of our country.
My beloved country , modern meanings are changing .
These days, however rich you are, how fresh your thinking is, however, everything has become a new corner, a new correspondence, a balance.
Therefore in the days of this festival everywhere the soil of environment has started .
If you see the room in YouTube , then in every house children are making soil colours and colors of it .
Some green colored vegetables , some colorful pieces of paper .
The media houses are also giving inspiration and direction to the people to make the idols of Ganapati idols suitable for the higher environment.
See how big change has come .
Change of fun.
As I said , our country is full of marvellous thoughts of crores of crores .
It 's a lot of fun by doing new shapes .
Some engineer himself told me that he got some special kinds of soil , mixing it , giving training to people making soil education .
After the worship the idol melts in a small baket , the statue melts in water immediately .
Three-three years ago I started the cleanliness mission and the coming October is completed three-three days .
The consequences of this park are seen .
The construction of the toilets has reached about 67 from 39 .
It is said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahrang was freed from excretion .
There have been terrible floods in Saurashtra in the middle.
Many people lost their lives .
But after the water of flood more bad odour spread .
In such a scenario, the workers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat, cleaned two and a half mosques affected by floods.
Everybody saved his sweat .
The attempts to make dedicated to the public are permanent naturally then our country can fly at a height of another .
In one way Deepavali , Navratri , Durga Puja is considered it adventurous .
Go to the market nearby , go to the village nearby , but consider this as a garden .

I have become a big opportunity to know the words of all the people of the country .
The more you wait for your mind , more than that I will wait for your messages .
They come into use for the work of my work .
Once some things get connected to our habits , we also think that we are ignoring .
"Prince Garu, I am talking to Arpana from Pune.
I want to tell you about my friend.
She is in an attempt to help people but a habit of her habit has made me merry .
I went to the shopping mall once with him.
On one pus two thousand rupees have been expensively expensive .
450 per pizza but the shopping mall has made barrassas for five rupees with the auto driver.
On the way vegetables buy vegetables on the way . Bermadi remains 4,5 rupees on each vegetable .
I didn't like it.
Not only this , if you go to sarasam in Shorum but if someone comes to work with the poor then there is no unconsciousness .
Do ye ever think that what he wants
In your life there is no importance of two rupees , five rupees in your life but do you think that how deep your minds can be wounded
Madam , I thank you for telling me about the subject of such heart by your phone call .
It is believed that the people of my country also have a habit of producing such a way with their poor , they must change .
My beloved youth , August is celebrated throughout the country on 29th day of August .
This is the birthplace of the great hockey sports , hockey magician Major Dhan Chand .
For his service which he hath done for Hakiki sports is none else .
The reason for remembering this thing is that our country is my desire to get rid of the emotional games of our country .
Sports should be a part of our life .
World Health Organisation has also been seen in the form of youth in the world .
One type of sports is the biggest medicine for mixing mind .
Come forward in the youth of our country . I warned that in the computer of Italy computer there is a lot of importance of playing field .
Play FIFA in computer but also show the football at any time in the fields outside .
Cricket plays in computer but playing cricket under the sky in the open field is different .
At one time the children of the house go out , when they ask .
Now the situation is such that children are also drowned in seeing photography , carton films or mobile gam .
Youth friends , sports tour centres have been prepared for discovering every year , glittering , glittering .
Wherever every child in the field of sports is present in the country, the success achieved in the field can be uploaded with bio-to-bio-energy in this portal.
Adventurous games give training to the sports of sports .
This portal has begun to morrow .
The happy news of our sports is that October 6 October in India has started the camp of 177 world camps .

The joy of creative emotional emotions , knowledge Taluku is the most important quality of one study .
Everybody kiss the five vertebrae with some or the other alternative .
Look at the way to successfully enjoy successfully in life .
Such environment can make our schools , our art galleries , our students .
If we talk about changes in our country , talk about family , if we talk about the society then the teacher remembers about the society .
There is a very big role of meditation in change .
Every study has been successful in bringing changes in each other 's life because of its natural creation in life , sometimes incidents happening .
If we try to connect together , then we can play a big role in changing the country .
Let us move ahead with the mantra of Teach to Transform.

It is understood that in the days of coming some good work is done that money comes into use .

It is considered its pride .
In the prime minister Jandhan Yoga about 65 thousand crores of rupees have been included in our lice .
In one way this is their energy during the days of lice .
Those people who are expensive by the prime minister January , they also got the benefit of Bima .
On the occurrence of obstacles of lice , on the death of the main person in the family they get two lakh rupees in a few days .
Reproductive vaginal irrigation , insulin , rubber card , prime minister mudra principle , common people have done any benefit .
I will make a complete attempt to reach them .
Due to such inspirations the media can also get complete benefit .
By proposing face to such people new generations can give new inspiration to new generations .
My beloved countrymen , forgive me once again if you are suffering from irritation and pain .
During rainy season the mind of man is very important .
Animals , birds , stairs , nature , everybody changes into joy due to rainy season .
Changes in the environment are occurring due to the changing season and its effect is also very fast .
In the last few days India has to face natural obstacles in some places of Assam , north-eastern regions , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal .
My friends of the Cabinet are also reaching the area wherever possible.
The state governments also provide excellent help to the problems of flood in their ways .
In such a situation the social institutions , cultural institutions , services of people are helping them in their own way .
The Government of India is happy to help those who get stuck in their lives at such times as the Military Jawans , Air Force , NDRF week .
The life of people becomes very unsuccessful by floods .
Fruits , animals , economic customs , roads , electricity , meditation etc all get affected .
Especially when our brethren , fruits were destroyed then they were not destroyed , especially the insurance companies of the fruits , especially the climate centres of the rail centres , they made an excellent plan to make a plan .
In order to face the situation of flood the control Room Health Line is working continuously for 24 hours .
People are also telling their problems .
Slowly we also do our work according to the information of this environment , we can save us from harms .
While I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat programme, I am seeing that more people of the country are getting ready than me.
I heard the progress of your Chartered Accountants Day , I was very impressed .
Last month, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into force in our country.
So can you say that the results of the government 's expectations are coming in the last months or not
In this matter I want to know your thoughts .
I am delighted to know how the prices are being reduced due to GST, how things are available cheaply and I am very happy to hear from someone who has come from the names.
Specially the trade of yoga is increasing on the trade of trade .
I am convinced of the impact of GST on transport and logistics.
How fast changes occurring rapidly , magnificence registration has created a new belief in the country .
Scientists and technologists in the financial system have studied the use of GST in India and sometimes stand before the world as a model.
This is a case study of the world 's university .
Because such a big height , such an important change , with the support of crores of people in this large country it is a very big task to run ahead in victory .
Definitely researches on this matter .
All the decisions have been taken concentration by mixing state , central governments .
The consequences of those concentrations are not able to take any kind of weight in lice .
Whatever was the price before the GST, what is the price in the new situation now, you can easily know it through your mobile phones in the GST app.
How easy , friendly environment has been formed between the government , businessmen , how important role has been played between the government , government and government .
I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries participating in this program, to all the Ministries, to all the Central and State Governments.
GST is a great example of India's sustainable energy.
If you want to say one way , this is a social collection .
For making such a big attempt easy I try to make the fort of all the residents of Kotla country .
Beloved my country residents , August meaning option month .
On 1920 August 1 support of support of support we were listening to the smaller time .
The uit India Movement was launched on 9th August, 1942, which is also known as the uit India Movement.
The independence of 1547 August came to the country .
Seeing a way , all the incidents happening in the month of August are also specially drowned with the history of freedom fight .
Our new generation should know what happened in the 9th honey of August in 1942 .
For the freedom from 1857 to 1942, the people of the country who have been buried with the freedom movement, the effort that has been shared is an inspiration for the creation of our emotional India.
At the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians led their lives through the mantra of 'Doo Ar Di'.
Lakhs of youths stopped their readings , leaving books .
The great men like Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan played an important role in the garden.
The uit India Movement of Assistance in 1920, the uit India Movement in 1942, both of which showcase both the forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1942, the momentum grew, the great men like Mahatma Gandhi also gave the mantra of 'Door Day' and the people's wisdom was behind it.
Once I am visiting the history of India, I am sure that the first freedom struggle of India started in 1857.
Then the initial freedom struggle of 1942 is going on some or the other corner of the country .
This surprising time has created an independence in the minds of the country .
Everybody has become ready to decide something or the other .
This industry done on 1857 to 1942 had reached the last stage of a new situation , confluence of confluence , 1942 .
The ueen India National Park has changed so much that in 1947 the British had to leave the country in 1947 .
1857 till 1942 this independence reached all the people of this independence .
Besides this , 1942 , 1947 along with five spectacles all the people were decided with one mind , contribution to give freedom to the country .
These five are like a spot .
Now I will mix you with a past .
We came to freedom in 1947 .
Now 2017.
Approximately seventy years passed .
Governments came .
The arrangement has been made , Marai , increasing , increasing .
Everybody tried to come out in the problems of the country in their own way .
As far as I had spent 2017 the five storeys of 20222 were also included in the same way as if the five storeys were drowned .
Try to fulfil them .
For example, from 1942 to 1947, five miles to the country's independence
These five , i . . 2017 till 20222 should be given miles for the future of India as well .
After five years the independence of the country is celebrated .
Therefore all of us should make a strong alternative .
2017 should be done in our cultural year .
Every Indian, social institutions, local institutions, schools, art galleries and institutions, each one of us is committed to New India.
Come , we are a part of this cultural festival .
Wherever we are, we will definitely be on the line, so I especially urge my young friends and my young friends to come forward to cooperate with them in creative ways to build a New India.
Use technology and bring new ideas like video , posts , blogs , papers , new ideas .
We forget this procedure .
We are also inviting uit India uiz for young friends at the Narendra Modi App.
This uiz is useful for introducing the freedom fighters by connecting the youth with the glorious history of our country.
It is believed that you will definitely make an expansive proposal of this attempt , spread all directions .
My dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, the Red Fort provides an opportunity to interact with the people of the country.
The voice of hundred crores of people from the Red Fort .
An attempt is made to give the form of words to those dreams. In the last three years, I would like to talk about August 15th and August 15th.
This time too, I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
In the last three August 15 months I heard that my reproductive organs are taking long time .
Therefore I decided that this time my progress should be lessened .
Beloved my country residents , I proposed another thing .
In the economy of India there is a social economy .
We should never take it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not only enjoyable .
Our festivals , our festivals , social collections are also there .
But along with this our festival is also directly drowned with the economic life of Pauri .
In a few days Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , Vinayak Chandra , after that Chaturdashi , Durga Puja , Deepavali .
The economic arrangement related to economy Rakhi starts making Rakhila in small domestic industries in lakhs of families .
The people who make Rakhis , Rakhis sell , sweets , thousands of people are filled with a festival of daily routine .
The families of our poor brother , sisters had spent their lives .
Not only the festival of lights but also the festival of bringing glory to the house .
Its relation is directly associated with the families of lice making small soil .
But I am talking about festivals , while talking about the economic arrangement of the poor lying with those festivals , along with them also talk about environment .
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are very high , active .
In the last months the best people were written to me for environment .
125 years , 125 crore people of the country .
At the same time for environment conservation we will say that we worship Ganesha i . . soil Ganesha for environment conservation .
It is said that for the festivals of different festivals coming to all the country residents of the country Gunnu has told many other objects .
Beloved my country residents , education , economic , social area , sports , sports , our girls are continuously going to give new goals to the country .
All the people of our country are also prideing to see our girls .
Cricket hair of our country has exhibited a unique game in the competitions of the world .
In this week I got the opportunity of getting Bhenti with those games .
I enjoyed talking to them very much but I thought that they were not able to spend the world camp very heavy .
In their Mughals also that disappointment , pressure has been seen .
If the players of India were smitten then we saw many games breaking on them with anger .
If you were not able to wander , then you had spent the hearts of 125 crore people .
I am told by those players that in reality our country is youth , especially our girls .
Once the second time I tell my heart to the youth of the country , especially to our girls , my heartbeats .
I also remember that 75 years of our independence will come in 2022.
Every country should make a sign of five paths for its cultural principle .
The beauty of the country , future is the best .
Blessed is the blessedness of all yourself .
It is a matter of great satisfaction that how hard we are in, we are in tension, whether we are in one's own life or people's lives, the coming of years fills one another with enthusiasm.
Jagannath Rath Yatra is being celebrated in many parts of the country with a lot of sacredness.

We have to constantly strive to get rid of such evils.
This incident took place in the Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh.

The Honourable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed Dr. Anil Sonaran from Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
I want to give you a question .
Can we do this country - wide implementation or not
I had the opportunity to remember the unconscious ovary of many times .
When I am the main minister of Gujarat then I decided to give books instead of flowers or welcome with hands .
Immediately I started giving the administration to the government .
Gradually this should change a part of our nature .
A flower vomits for a while .
Taking it in hand once , leaves again .
I am describing such stores which have historical value .
And when the last year went to London , the British queen Elizabeth called me to eat .
The ruins made of cotton are that in the time of giving me a glimpse of her eyes shining .
On the day of his lips this hand and Mahatma Gandhi Garhwal gave him not only in the marriage of his marriage , this was left .
Besides the beauty of Mahatma Gandhi it is surprising to keep the house of Eligibet queen at home .

I know that such good habits come at night .
There is complete transparent transparent .
Government officials will surely examine the details of persons registered in EGEM.
Because of no medieval things are available .

To complete a thousand days is an important step in the journey of space .
Along with studies youngsters are also participating in the programs of playing games . All these are the logists of their future .
Our sportspersons reached a prideful position in our country with victory and our fame spread throughout the world.
Kidambi Srikanth Indonesia Open was the player of the badminton of our country.
I heartily congratulate Shrikanth and his coach for this great victory.
In the development of personality sports play a unique role .
Sports are very important in the construction of the person .
There is no dearth of every part of our country .
If you like children in our families then give opportunity to water in the Rang Rang .
Taking water from the field of sports , binding in the room it is not possible to change the worms of books .

This sacred Ranjan is helpful in moving ahead of this peace , unity , emotional way .
I told everyone again .
It has a lot of happiness to give it to many people .
Everybody has seen enthusiasm to tell their matters .
I could not read all the water , everybody could not listen to me at least . All the messages came .
But I have seen consciously that some attempts to learn music , some try to learn new music , some try to learn new things with the help of Uutual University , some try to learn new languages .
Some are learning , some are learning dance , some are learning , some are also learning poets .
Try to know about nature , living , understanding direction .
I'd like to hear you even call a phone call.
That is, I am talking about Diksha Kaital.
I had a complete habit of reading .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I understood that how much sacrifices were required to fight for India's independence, how many freedom fighters had to pay, how many freedom fighters had spent years in jails.
How many acquaintances were influenced by Bhagat Singh in small age .
Therefore, I would like you to convey your message to the younger generation about this.
I am very happy to learn about the history of our country, about our freedom fighters, about those who laid down their lives for the country.
The great men who were counted had lost their youth in the jail .
Those great men who spend in jail in freedom fight , reading , writing etc . have done a very big work .
We know that all those people have also given very power to the independence of India .
Many years ago I went to see the Cellular Jail of Andaman - Nicobar .
The poets used to come on the walls .
He was bound in a small dark room .
What kind of anxiety have the lovers of freedom
When I read the book 'Maji Janmathe' from Savarkar, I was very enthusiastic to see the Cellular Jail.
There's also a light sound show, which is very inspiring.
I have said that for the freedom that we have got, people have experienced so many difficulties, if we go to the Cellular Jail then it is Kalapani that I will definitely tell the youth of the country.
If you are also possible then definitely go to this pilgrimage area related to our freedom fight .
Beloved my country , June is one Monday in 5 months of June .
If you want to say one more thing, back to basics.
Nature has to be seen with nature , increasing betel plate .
Who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi Register
Mahatma Gandhi's guide repeatedly said, 'No one must care about a world one will not see'.
That is , we should also think about the world , take care of the world .
You will see that the power of nature is that on getting tired properly when a glass of water cools on the pimples then how freshness comes .
On getting tired properly opening the windows , opening the doors , fresh air comes new chaitanya .
That is why the attempt of the world to drown with the nature of June should also be given our own attempt .
Our ancestors are now available to us as a result of protecting environment .
It is said that the cause of cleanliness of our body is Prithvi .
It is a matter of coming out when Buddha had headed Lord Buddha that the birth of Lord Buddha , his wisdom was found , his Mahapravan had been done under a tree .
Readers , readers , city residents , tribals , tribals , natural worship , nature lovers are a part of their social life .
But we need to connect this thing with modern designs , modern thoughts .
In the midst of this I am giving gifts from the states .
That is , in approximately all the states the program of rains starts , big plants start .
Plants are planted in numbers of crores .
Yoga exercise is not just exercise .
Keeping in mind the day of yoga day of two days I came to the north of all the governments of the world , all the governments of the world .
In the year I declared some competitions related to yoga . some gifts .
Gradually the task of that direction moves forward .
It's a very interesting advice.
Girl , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , son , sons , daughters , one - three generation yogasana should be done by putting those photographs in yogasana .
Today, today, I would like to thank you for giving me a new measure of Yoga and I would like to thank you for giving me this advice.
It is a matter of pride as we gained a very interesting experience by the method of ' selfie with dough ' .
These three generations wearing yogasana definitely give their photographs to the country , worldwide .
Three generations they had done yoga , they should definitely send photographs while doing yogasanas together .
In a way it should be called a positive health care garden .
Since then I have been touring in different states of India .
While returning I realized that some are taking very minutely Modi where are you going .
If this photography is heard then it is considered to be Mikda .
Modi Garu , I am often seen in the midst of the social media media in the midst of this that even at every place you are taking special attention towards cleansing .
On Mumbai , Surat I . . on your adventurous people are adopting cleanliness of crowds .
The publicity of hygiene that you have started from Kashi Ghat has turned into a motive with your inspiration: 'Your words are true.
Wherever I go , the government will organise the cleanliness program but in the midst of this society also cleanliness has become a festival .
Five days ago, seven days ago, ten days ago, a massive cleanliness drive will take place.
All these things of the country do not know how much carefully , do not consider this thing , how much joy can you imagine .
I also congratulate all those who encourage this cleanliness program.
Somebody gave me advice .
The advice of truth is very interesting .
I know not whether I can do it or not .
Modi Garu , when you decide your tourism then what kind of tourism do you want to call me Babu , how much will your cleanliness level be
The alternative is very good but I should think .
But such a garden should be made . It is a very good thing that by cleaning the garbage of so many tonnes which gives very good thing .
By doing this many people should be saved from the diseases .
The Government of India has decided to launch an important programme on vain management with the help of State Governments and cities.

Two types of garbage are available . colored diabetes , other blue colored diabetes .
All these work properly in potatoes . fields keep in mind that they are green , what is remembered in the garbage of potato .
Second type of garbage dumps , bags , iron , glasses , plastic , polythene , broken rubbers , metals etc . come into the dry area by putting them in instruments .
In the last few days, you must have heard that Versova Beach has become a clean and beautiful Versova Beach in Mumbai.
Approximately eighty-nine weeks along with the city dwellers laboured and changed the form of this Versova beach . After a few thousand tonnes of garbage was removed from that place the Versova beach became clean and beautiful .
The Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV) took its full responsibility.
Shri Afroz Shah was enrolled in this work on October 2015 and gradually the programme became big and public.
Beloved my country , in the last fifteen months of the last fifteen months , TV Channels Point , Soshil media people are seeing the number of the government .
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of 'Pradhan Mantri Servant'.
Several moments , opinions have been done .
I adopt all these procedures healthy information .
In every test all these three legs have been tested .
Every part of the society has polluted it .
There is an excellent procedure in delivery .
I also tell blessed to all those who give special , main food bakery .
On coming to Lotu , Lopalu light one gets the opportunity to fulfil them .
The thing is good , something good , something bad , learning from it , walk ahead with its evening .
The negative examination strengthens the delivery .
For a very good country , a conscious country this importance is necessary .
This is the same thing that many families were written to me .
One person , one ordinary Pauri has increased this incident with my enthusiasm .
Even while sitting at such a big place, I would like President Reiki, Vice President Reiki and Speaker Reiki to have given me so much importance to Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given a new dimension to the programme.
Friends, sometimes I was talking to you when I was working on the book Mann Ki Baat.
I'll be in debt to Akbar Rei.
Beloved my country , this time the rains of all the countries keep on falling on meeting us .
Come , let us move ahead while loveing nature in this environment .
Blessed is the blessedness of all your generations , blessed .
Beloved people of my country , Namaskar .
Probably arrangements , people have become a habit of these problems .
The subjects of children , youths , elderly experiences etc are coming in my sight .
While traveling in the bus , while traveling in the train someone comes , immediately someone comes and gives some advice .
Advice , information is that we are in our nature .
Many people trying to reach me , to give advice are doing something in their life .
With some good handicraft they change their intelligence , energy , capacity according to the situations .
Some people also tell their advice at the place of their work , the rest of the people who have heard that they have become a synonym of a synonym for everyone .
Besides this when I proposed some thing then it would be very happy to remember such things .
After that Narendra Modi App, MyGov, many people from all corners of the country have made such creative attempts to see food in vain.
I also sent some videos .
There are roti banks at some places .
May is the establishment of one , Maharashtra , Gujarat states .
This conclusion is many luxurys for the people of both these states .
Crossing many new development peaks of both the states continuously try to give their support to the progress of the country .
In both the states the Mahapurush has been continuously labouring , every kind of society of the society their life keeps on giving us support .
These great men are reminding , on the day of independence on the occasion of the state seventy five , i . . 2022 , all our states , all our society , all our cities , all our families should be included .
Make a plan to establish that cultural heritage . Walk ahead with the help of all people .
On the second time these two states are my many ruins .
The rapidity of summer staying in the months of May , June in our country has to be felt this time in the months of March , April .
That is why this time when I am advising advice for mind , more percent advice has been given advice to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also published not only new , but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that Balcony has to keep water for birds , birds .
In many families small children also saw this work .
Once if this work comes in their sight , then birds come to see whether there is water in the cup or not .
We are such a sports but in reality it is a unique experience of lifting up copulation in mind .
Although in our country it is important to give strength to such efforts about animals , nature with animals , nature , but it is important to give strength to such efforts .
When I was the main minister of Gujarat then Danudi Bohra society came to Sayadana Regiri for hundred years .
He lived an hundred three times .
On the day of his hundred birth the Bohra society of Bohra society has run a very big garden to preserve the parents by their Bhurani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .

Try new places , new experiences , new experiences .
I want that why do you have interest in this summer holidays then try to know them .
Give new use .
Use should be positive and keep you out of your comfort zone.
We are of the comfortable families of middle class .
What is the matter of those travellers , what do they do after getting down at the station
In the evening go to the bus for filling moments with your foot balloon , Wali Balloon or other games .
Play yourself with those poor children , then see when you get the joy of never enjoyed in life in playing game .
In the society children spending such life in the society get the chances of playing with you then know what kind of change comes in their life .
I can say with belief that if you go once then I will go again .
This experience will teach you a lot .
The ill effects of technology have come to reduce the borders , but the ill effects of it have changed how six persons living in one house are in one room also to imagine the distance between them .
Away from technology can you try to spend time with you
If we pay attention to our country full of many opinions then we will get to learn something or the other nearby .
If you do not swim , learn this , try to give something or the other on the imagination of driving , try to give something or the other on the imagination of the imagination .
Sometimes we felt as if we do not learn some tasks then we can not learn .
You can learn the cost of walking but when you want to learn auto rickshaw .
You may have to come to pick up a cycle but do you ever try to take people to Trichakra
Look , these new attempts , new experts not only give you happiness , but also your life tied in one condition can be pulled out in it .
Keep showing Indraja to your friends .
I am talking with my experience , how much learning the world is possible to know how much we can not even imagine .
See new places , new cities , new cities , new villages , new places , new places .
But before going wherever you are going , go to the practice , seeing a gynaecologist there , to know , to ask people , to ask them , to see those places you will have a different joy .
That is why you will get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends , this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity .

Normally in our country there is a irritable environment of View Calculation .
Now even if red light has gone on vehicles , the red light entering the brain can not be said hardly .
Namaskar Prime Minister Garu, I will be speaking to Shiva Chaube from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I'd like to talk about the government-decided red beacon light ban.
It seemed very pride to me .
Now my time is also so important that it has been enjoyed .
I don't want to stray in the traffic jam.
I want to know the blessedness of my heart for this decision .
The Red Fort is a part of the Red Fort by the government 's decision .
The emergence of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country is the New India Bhawan.
EPI in place of VIPs, my feelings are clear- Every person is important.
Every person has the importance of every person , every person has importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then how big power is there to make important dreams of 125 crore people of the country
All of us should do this work .
Dear countrymen, we will always remember our history , our culture , our tradition .
Therefore we get energy , inspiration .
This year our 125 crore people of the country are celebrating their thousand Jayanti .
Because of some reason we are not able to take so much that how small we think that more than one century is thinking .
Use cosmetics .
It is also so difficult to come out of the society of the society .
How was it that before a thousand
Ramajacharyas had done very big fighting against the society of the society , descriptions , species , species etc . during his time .
They were hungry all of them by their own jewellery .
Before a thousand years he got the permission to enter the house , all of them got the permission to enter the house .
It is our fortune to be a great man from our society to end the evil of that time society in every age.
Today we are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Ramajacharya, and we are inspired by him in the effort to enhance social integration.
To morrow the Government of India has released a Tapla Billa in the memory of Swami Ramayana dynasty .
I keep telling the customs of Swami Ramjacharyas , I am offering .
Beloved my country , to morrow we have another speciality of Tarikh .
It is celebrated in many places across the world as the day of labour.
It is natural to remember the guide of Babasaheb Ambedakar on the day of the afflicted people , when it was discussed about the afflictions , then I remembered Babasaheb Ambedakar .
Italy I am reminding about Babasaheb Ambedakar , Swami Ramjacharyas , the twelfth century of Karnataka , the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society of the society .
In the twelfth century, he had taken deep thoughts on the subject of hard work and labour.
In the Kannada Bashan he said , Kavelas .
It means that you can enjoy the attainment of the house of Shiva by your industry.
That is , heaven gets obtained from Karma .
If you want to say in the second thing , then Shiva was Shiva .
It is natural to remember the guide of Datttapat Tengdi while talking about the labors .
Beloved people of my country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapurnima .

On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
Their memory is available to remind their memories .
My dear countrymen, we have always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India.
In India, Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas comes not only in India but also in the global arena.
Especially our two countries also come .
We should be helpful with our two countries , development should happen to them .
Many uses are done .

Beloved people of my country , sunshines are fast , save yourself , save yourself .
Most of the families of the country are standing in the test of their children .
In their families that have been tested the atmosphere of cosmetic environment , tests , tests have been very stressful in families .
In such a scenario, I can say one thing, listen to what I have said to the students in the Manas in the past.
In a historic war happening opposite to unrighteousness Bangladesh has studied the victory of Bangladesh in a history war .
On such a special day I want to go ahead in the development of Bangladesh by telling many brethren , brothers and sisters in the independent day of the independence of Bangladesh .
India will continue to contribute to the development of Bangladesh by working with you as a strong friend and a good friend and by protecting the peace and tranquility in this region.
Our Ravindranath Tagore is a pride with the pride of giving the heritage of both our countries .
Because Bangladesh is the secret of our Guru Ravindranath Tagore .
One interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that he was the first person to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 and the British gave him the title of Knighthood.
In 1919 when the British created the monastery in Jalian Walla Bagh then Rabindranath Tagore is also one .
This incident is the time of showing strong effect on the mind of a twelve children .
In the childhood to spend playing this Jalian Walnut has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 the twelve dynasty was the favorite , inspiration for all of us , Amarvi Bhagt Singh .
These three days creative March , on the 23th honeymoon of the month of 23th March , he had climbed the English goddess Sukhdev , Rajguru .
This incident Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Raj Guru , without fear of three deaths , we all know that the happiness of conserving India has remained .
We can not even keep the story of the life of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Raj Guru .
The British empire of Javat was afraid of these three .
They were in the jail while they were in the jail , how was the British gradually with them .
Therefore nobody had to impart training on the 24th honeymoon of March , March 23th day of the month of March .
Besides this stealing their dead goddesses were made thirsty by bringing them to the Punjab region .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time then a kind of eforts occurred in my body .
Whenever opportunity is available , I am suggesting to the youth of the country by going to Punjab , Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , other maternal maternal maternal mortality rates of Batkeshwar .
At that time calling for freedom , its rapidity , its quantity is increasing .
On one side these were inspired by the youths like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Raj Guru .

He served the rails being identified in the Champaran .
To remove many illusions situated in the case of blood pressure they themselves have served the patients of blood pressure .

My beloved countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Celebration of Celebrations is a very important turning point in the freedom struggle.
I participated in the inauguration of a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
By this others also write three - four things by expressing your emotions with those photographs .
During the coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been organised .
But in this context one interesting thing wants to participate with you .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time an interesting exhibition was organised in the Indian building of Venice Biennale with Gandhian memorials.
In this Haripura Panels are specially interesting .
In Haripura of Gujarat the conclusion of Kangras is celebrated , in which the history of Subhash Chandrabus is remembered for you .
This is a pretty past for art panels.
Prior to the meeting of Haripura of Kangras, Mahatma Gandhi had invited Princepal Nandlal Bose, the penny of Shantiniketan Kalabhavan in 1937-38.
Gandhiji expressed hope that his lifestyle in India should be displayed through art and exhibition of his artwork in this meeting.
The art work of our state is this Nandal Bos .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
Along with the art gallery of this Bos George art gallery has made its own emergence .
Nandal Bose has made a art canvas by touring the villages nearby Haripura , at the end the rural life of India .
This precious art gallery was discussed in Venice.
I would like to convey my best wishes to Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary.
Do something or the other for the country , society , society .
The same is Bapu's right, true functionality.
This time it starts from 11 September .
During this time, we will come out of our homes and pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
The house , street , but the roads are Gony , but art gallery but cleanliness should be done in all the public places .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
While talking from August 155 crores of people of the country have done enthusiasm , energy , how to get rid of excretion from excretions in Bahraang places .
And all of us must stop Single Use Plastic's man.
All sections of the society are enthusiastic about this proposal.
Through this money will be saved, it will play a role in protecting the environment.

I am giving a gift to all the classes of the society , every village , every city resident .
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated with the plastic garbage of India .
All Municipality , Copper Corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , private arrangements , all the organizations , everybody 's administration is that there should be adequate arrangement of plastic garbage .
I urge all corporate sectors to examine how the disposal can be arranged sufficiently.
It can be rescilled .
It can be fuel .
Today I want to say a very important thing with a culture .
There is a lot of importance of food in our culture .
As much as we were also included in science .
The Nutrition Abhiyan is being promoted in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting ways .
Once came into my point of view .
In Nasik, a major initiative called Filled Crops has been taken.
In which in the days of harvest anganbari services are included one cereal from the people .
Women , children make this grain hot food .
In this the person donating donating is becoming the service of a Jaguary society .
This culture is celebrated during the feeding of the child for the first time .
Fluid food is not honourable .
Saurashtra had thought in 2010 that why should not it be necessary to give compulsory food to children in the context of food habits
This is very important , which can be participated everybody .
In many states people eat food .
A unique function of service , joyful feelings is spectacular .
O sisters , by many small methods our country can be brought to the effect of fighting with malnutrition .
Today information about right information or poor people , wealth are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated as a Poshan Abhiyan across the country.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I felt very sure that there would be a lot of questions about this.
During the last few weeks, I had met people where I had come here about Man Vs Wild.
I have not imagined that the opportunity of reminding the youth of the world has come in my life .
But what happens .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As the Prime Minister, whenever I came to visit, I am reminded of one thing: "I talk to someone in the world about Yoga for five-ten minutes because of International Yoga Day.
The people who do not discuss Yoga with me in the world 's biggest ground, I am talking about the whole world.
Discovery Channel has planned to publish this program in 165 countries .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate Jasts , clean environment in our country .
But the more interesting thing is that some are asking me one thing , Modi , you are talking in Hindi , Bear Grylls do not Hindi .
Do not do any cost of adventure after this .
Then what happened to shoot again .
It is questioned very carefully .
See , there is no secret in it .
Many people have this question in their minds. Okay, I tell you this secret now.
Actually this is not mystery .
Actually technology has been used completely in the conference happening with Bear Grylls .
As I have said anything, it has been done in English as a result of which a small card lease has been kept in the ears of Bear Grylls.
Therefore, if I talk to him in Hindi then due to his listening to him in English the conversation was successful and this is the miracle of technology.
After this show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to places like nature , wildlife , living .
What's the nature
You will stay watching .
Your interference will also be large .
On 15th August, I made a request to you that at least 15 places in the three days to come, 15 places in India are completely tourist destinations.
You go, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought is enlarged .
My beloved country , the thought of environment protection , care i . . conservation is seen naturally in India .
In the last month I was spectacular to release the population of tiger in the country .
Do you know how many tigers in India
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred sixty seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below some time .
A tiger conference was held in St. Petersburg, Russia about tigers in 2010.
In which the number of tigers has been taken information about reducing the number of tigers .
The number of tigers in the world of 2022 calculla is that contribution .
But now this new India will fulfil the goals soon .
We double the number of tigers here in 2019 .
In India not only the number of tigers but the number of wilderness , committee reserves has also increased .
While releasing the tiger detail I also recognized the Gir lions of Gujarat .
When I responsiblely responsible there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was decreasing .
We did a lot of things together in Gir.
In 2007 the decision of making women guards there .
We have improved the infrastructure for increasing the tourist arrivals.
When we talk about natural , wild animals then preservation is discussed .
But along with safety think about taking this church towards Karnataka .
Therefore it is not necessary to save forests , trees , wild animals , they should also give appropriate environment to increase properly .

Our villages and farms are the core pillars of our countrys economy.
Train routes are being explored amongst many hardships.
The government has also taken several important decisions to give priority to farmers and villages.
Small traders of our country are employed and economic activities are being carried forward.
Like bigger malls, small shops in the villages can also trade for 24 hours and we have taken a major decision in the budget under which to stop them because as per my opinion, when big malls are trading for 24 hours, why should not the smallest poorest of the poor in the villages get the same opportunity
We have initiated several steps to give them loans through the Mudra Yojana.

This is as easy as you sent the WhatsApp messages.
An uneducated person can also be washed, mailed or forwarded on this day.
Besides, technology has become so easy that there is no need for a big smartphone for this purpose.
The cash transfer will also be done through our small ordinary phone phones.
I am very well aware that all of you are participating in this important event.
But, dear young friends, I want your help in this thing.
Technologies will be available for online access to your mobile phones.
Moreover, how to use technology in two hours and hours everyday, how to download your bank yap and how to spend your money in your account
Candidates should also be trained on how to do business through technology.
In order to ensure a seamless society and a mouth-borne programme, you will have to work towards a non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, anti-violent, anti-violent, anti-violent and anti-violent programme.
You will get the blessings of the poor once taught the method of using cards.
Within a month, we will be a new modern India of the world.
You can do this through mobile phones and go to ten houses a day and do this thing.

Normally, such discussions have enriched the number of diabetes that the Central Government has enjoyed in the manner of States, and no matter how much money every State has owed.
In such a scenario, the Union Government officials were surprised to know that some States have made exemplary efforts to address the menace of water, environment and drought, and to take care of the suffering human beings.
I had asked NITI Aayog to exercise the best practices to all the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have utilized the technology completely.

I would like all of you to confess that when your children bring home the results of the test, please convey them with joy and happiness.
Encourage them to grow further and if not, they have brought hundred per hundred.
If you do anything else then it will be better that day too.
The challenges surrounding me are not recognised.
These categories are not well marked.
But what has happened to that poet - I felt my pain on the emblem of life.
While keeping the picture in view, they suggested that it should be lightened, it would have been better if the blue color had been blue instead of blue color, and that the song would have been better if it were not brick and brick.
The pain in the picture is not understood, but more people who say it should be lightened.
However, if you do not rejoice at the outcome, you will never be able to do new things.
It will be a pleasure and a fruitful endeavour.
It keeps on fighting in life.

Since last two years , due to the adverse effect of Durbhakshakshakshakshakshakshakshak , water reservoir has been adversely affected .

That is, they have decided to stop imprisonment and banana trafficking.
It is very easy to hear, but in reality it is not that easy.
Is it a big decision

When water level rises, there is a lot of change in water quality.
Clean drinking water is also a cause for GDP growth.
But how many people around us are making every effort to deal with the untouchability and how new methods are being adopted to solve them.
Why shouldn't we dug the soil in the pond this time and put it in the field
The field will also be well covered and the field will also be able to rejuvenate water.
Sometimes, in cement bags, sometimes in empty red bags, stones, soil filling, stopping the water from flowing through the waste.

One more thing I have to do is to clean up the 3rd and 4th and why interview the workers.
Several times, I feel one more thing to say that nobody has made a ticket on certain routes in rail travel.

However, I will talk to you about other books without delay.
However, I am convinced that the time has not been enough for reading more books.
But, it has been a gain that if you look at the descriptions you are writing, I would like to know the details of a lot of books.
It seems that we need to take it forward with the experience of these months.
Why should we not have a valid books corner in this Narendra Modi App, where we can read, write and discuss new books
You can give a good name to our books corner.
We will make it a practical platform for the readers and writers.
Keep reading and writing, and keep sharing with all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.

Our Mann Ki Baat moved ahead by asking all the cleanliness drives.
And all the efforts made for Swachhata remain inspired by Mann Ki Baat.
Beginning five years ago, the expedition will reach a new milestone of Swachhata in collaboration with all the people.
Ghani is not an ideal place in Swachhata, but an association with 130 crore citizens from ODF to a Swachhta drive in public places.
But we will stop here.
The mission will go a long way in enhancing cleanliness.

Through the Street Art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
It has been renewed in the tradition that people's cooperation will not only be harvested beautifully by the Over Bridge, from the side walls to the slum huts.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh.
This will also bring us to the fore in the beauty of Swachhata.
This is known as Mahmad Aslam Bhai of Shopia, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote that it would be better to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am delighted to say that I have played an active role in organising the Community Mobilization Programme Back to Village in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

On the success of Amarnath Yatra, I will highlight the hospitality and hospitality of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.
I am aware that more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham this time in Uttarakhand, within a month from the start of the Chardham Yatra.
Pilgrims have reached such a record number for the first time since the terrible disaster in 2013.
My only request to all of you is that you should not touch those places which are beautiful during the rainy season in the country.
To see these beauty in our country, none of the greatest teachers will be a tourist destination to know the souls of the people of our country.
There is a lot of hardship in other parts of the country.

Like cricket now there is an interest in footbal , hockey , tennis , kabadi .
You will be aware that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year.
The world has come to our country for playing twenty four waters from all over the world .
In 1951 in Asian Games the golden plates of Indian football were spent in 1962 , and in 1956 Olympic Games the hair of India stood at fourth place .
In some decades of ill effects we slipped from there .
I don't even want to tell you about our rankings in the FIFA.
On the other hand, in the youth of India I am going to grow so much in the youth of India that it is English Premiere Leg , or Leg Leg , or let Indian Super Leg match .
Indian youth are giving time to know about these matches, or to see them in TV.
I have said that when we get the opportunity to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup, we will only fulfil our responsibility by playing an important role in this sports.
Or do we encourage sports by using this opportunity as profitable for us
Football, football, football, we should create a changing environment this year - in schools, arts and in arts, in every corner of India.
Our children should be kissed by playing football in our youth , sweat .
Although it has been done , for giving guests we get the opportunity of Sicily .
Therefore , we should try to take the beauty of foot balcony village , streets .

If you are really interested to see , then you should also prepare an international point of view to see them .
The journey plays an important role in relaxing life .
Now the journey in the youth of India is increasing in the youth , gynaecology .
In the days ahead they did not go on the way to go everybody , on the way ready .

In the past water places , places of water in the past we can prepare water by cleaning the garbage by cleaning the garbage and reaching the water even more .
Full of lakes , if our rivers , canals are filled then the deficiency of water will not be visible after that we will not suffer much harm .
But it is possible to stand by holding the leopard of every rain water .
This time there is a contribution of excavation of five lakh water .
Although in this direction it is necessary to make any other attempt .

It is associated with you that how much happy I am .
I would like to know from you about how best we can use the FIFA Under-17 World Cup for our benefits in 2017.
How to do this program .
The program of AIDS is a special opportunity to do this .
They have done photographs of such grand places that seeing them really enjoys how much .
I consider it a good sign .
Wherever there is no leg , you like to bear feet there .
This contribution is considered to be special impressions of India .
In comparison to the countries of the world India is very behind the tourism of India .
You also think like this .
I'll tell you one thing to think.
Look - you will be happy .
I would like to tell you once again in Mann Ki Baat.
If you want to say the truth , I forgot its identity .
How much happy you have spent this thing .
For the preservation of water we should take these churches with complete care .
Many other diseases in our body are the guests of our body that enter our body .
Definitely think about this thing .
It is said that for testing Babu test the tuberculosis comes .
It is said that whatever TV has come to him .
It means that this disease is such that it can also be tested very fast .
But if you do not think that this work is not because of the government , doctors , medicines , therefore the people of the country are my support .
Therefore , the same light remains in your mind as well .
I also want to meet you in this journey .
In the matter of tests of your children as much as you are in case of tests , Nauku is that same .
But if we change our thought about tests , perhaps we will get rid of this campaign .
I have said this much earlier in Mann Ki Baat that your experiences and suggestions must not be sent through NarendraModiApp.
Today, I would like to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers especially in Mann Ki Baat.
I know that tests start in a few days .
Everybody asks how is ready to go , tests .
How many times come , how much do I scorpion , I told one another .
You decide yourself for yourself .
I kept many estimations on me while playing cricket , how much hoped from me .
The estimation of some estimations while passing .
Then how important was I needed to discover it .
I decided my goals myself , I am able to fulfil them so much good for the country .
I was constantly trying to meditate those goals .
My eye lashes have been fulfilled slowly on the ball .
Good luck.
Make your future .
It is believed that these words of Sachin Register are definitely useful for you .
Why should we not keep ourselves clear with us
Wherever we reached , how far we came .
Do not get stuck in the number of such numbers .
One of the most important objectives of life should be to make a journey with a dream.
Therefore if a large , high dream is made then the tests which changes into a joyful year .
It is very important to say that in healthy body there is a healthy mind in them .
If we say that our daily routine should be a medium of dreams and resolves for 365 days.
He has specially done that you should sleep regularly , waking up early in the morning , waking up early in the morning .
Taking the entry centres of test centres , other things should be reached before time .
Do not do this .
I believe that you can do this .
Otherwise , in order to keep the foundation of victory over victory over life remains the root cause of nutritiousness .
A strong foundation falls from the infected moment .
They are unconscious , they do not tired of regular symptoms , they do the work of dawn in the morning , how much of the work is done after the night .
Not only this , our daily routine also becomes temporary .
Therefore we should not see anything small .
Definitely, do it.
Friends , friends ,
Sometimes I saw that in the students going to the test two types of water are seen .
Who can say this thing better than me, that is, the Chardrangam Champion Vishwanathan, who has played the role of sportspersons in the world.
He divides his experiences with you .
Come , let us learn how to build these tests by him .
Hello, I enjoy Vishwanathan.
How I am ready for my tests , what is my experience now .
It has been seen that these tests were like the problems occurring before in life .
Therefore if you are peaceful , eat nutritious food , sleep straight , then only your brain can remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute you should see a very important store , otherwise you will feel that you have no mark once again .
Vishwanath 's joy is really important .
The more he sits in the international charang competitions , how much concentration you will discover .
Is not Arjun standing on the eyes of the bird
If you are standing on the banks of a pond then you will find many things in water below .
Initially when there is no cost of anything then seem to be seen after putting stone .
If water is melted , then steps are also seen in it .
It takes 30,40,50 seconds but once my mind is ready to understand things calm .
This can be my experience , it is also useful for you .
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing .
He wrote in my App: We will talk peacefully with friends and family members at least half an hour every day.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then wear things .
We are trying to reach out to the current situation by extending Ranchi Manas, within the country and outside the world.
Such worshipped Murari Bapu had sent an important chicken pox for the students .
He is also a teacher , thought , therefore there is a meeting of both in his words .

The pride of success is also pride .
As a poet, I would like to convey my message and my best wishes that there is no rule of gratitude for everyone.
Try to live together with fails also .
Our Honourable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has said that the Mann Ki Baat programme is invaluable.
I also thank him for giving a very good message to all of us .
How much happy is this to me .
All this has come to the birth of memories , which seems very good to me .
I just want to tell you that today, start doing yoga from the bottom of the pit - it will be wrong for you.
Very light solution .
Definitely pay attention to it .
Look, you can do them.
Why do all these things do the cost of cost .
Read these informations according to your caution . two minutes , three minutes , five minutes .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question seems difficult .
Therefore competition tests .
Do not bed , do the work without bending your energy .
And it came to pass , that I said unto all my young friends , This is the same .
At the same time, keep in mind that there are immense opportunities in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life , do not take it forever .
You win.
You don't forget about this universal maternal child.
Just like trees and mountains, you also have the right to stay here.
You will have to take the feet , immense feeling , meditation .
By these symptoms you will be excited in all the tests .
If you want to do then I hope for success in every matter .
Bless you .
Seeing , how does a great scientist speak
To say that I take half an hour , that thing is said in three minutes .
This is the strength of scientific science . This is the strength of scientist mind .
I tell thanksgiving thanks to the children of the country for giving support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then fear will also be afraid .
For doing good , the future of gold is waiting for you .

It is said that during the tests the members of his family members keep trying continuously to stay in a social environment , this kind of exercise is also done in their families .
Sometimes there are a lot of things that do not inspire the bold words that inspire us.

Vijay Jindal had written that he should not bear his weight on children .
Today parents do not want to say much .
Do not let the child fall in tension .
If you talk to a friend - do not ask him.
Why do I say that today national science day is the day of national science .

Similarly, I would like to mention that the biggest successful Direct Investment in the world has been placed on the Ginns Book of World Records under the Direct Benefit Scheme.
The scheme, named Pehl, has been implemented in a very successful manner.
On the one hand, the Aadhaar card scheme, opening of Jan Dhan Accounts on the other, third state and central governments have joined hands with the beneficiaries - Aadhaar and Accounting with Accounts.
The National Rural Livelihood (NRL) scheme is being implemented in the villages.
Now about 40 thousand crore rupees are being directly transferred to the beneficiary's accounts through various schemes.

There is a woman named Noor Jahan from Kanpur.
If she looks at TV, she won't look much cheaper.
However, no one can think of what she is doing.
It is providing light to the poor using solar energy.
It's fighting on darkness.
The crowd takes her to Lander in the evening.

We have to attain that pace as fast as possible.
However, the beginning was well done.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have been given Rs. 42 thousand crore from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
The Abhishek himself spoke of his enthusiasm.
There will also be a lot of news to me.
He said that Shailesh Bhonsle is the only person in Mumbai.

She's doing her job.
That is why she used to bring a lot of money in the past and used to do business very badly.

I have to say another thing about Kerala today.
I have received a script from the top school students of St. Mary, Kerala-Kochi, Chittor.
I was sent a picture of Mother India in the shape of India.
I was astonished to see why they have painted the shape of India with their own seals.
But I understand after reading the script that those who want to give such a great symbolic message.
These girls have made a vigilance to the Prime Minister, not merely that.
Their goal is to transform body transplant into a profession.

From that point of view, this House is very important.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a very good job.
Millions of students visited the exhibition.
The people of the village have seen it.
The people knew what Mahatma Gandhi had played in African-India relations and what was the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality in these two regions.

My dear brothers and sisters, how will there be no mention of cleanliness in this conversation
The message was sent from Mumbai via a women telephone called Savitarai.
This time, we will clean our houses and our traditions on Diwali.
Consequently, with Deepawali, the mission on sanitation started automatically.
You have said that what we think before the festival should be brought into the form of a festival after the festival.
We should do this in every public programme.
Today, I convey my best wishes to all the media organizations in the country.
On 2nd October last year, I had the privilege of attending the commemoration of the 7th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The institute conferred the Clean India Awards.
I recall how such people have worked for Swachh Bharat under the One Lake One Mission.
What kind of countries have been cleaned in our country
All these came to light and I heartily congratulated the India TV Group on this marvelous initiative.
Around 51 lakh children from around 55,56,000 schools in the States of Andhra and Telangana participated in the programme.
He also highlighted the importance of cleanliness in areas such as Bahraing regions, railway stations, spiritual provinces, hospitals and parks.
Now these messages give us the strength to achieve the goals of Swachh Bharat through these programmes.
Therefore, whatever Smt. Savitarai suggested, all the citizens of the country are now taking the programme forward as their duty.
He further said that in Asia, the most clean village Aravar is the clinest village.
It was heartening to note that far away from our country, we have won several awards in the field of cleaning of villages in the beautiful north eastern region of Meghalaya.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said that there are a few things that have been lost in the Red Fort.
When a poor person goes to smaller jobs, how much he has to pay for the recommendations, however, however, however, however, however, he gets to ask for money from the groups, however, however, he loses his job, however, however, he loses his money.
I have never heard in the world how much a psychiatrist can understand one person in one or two minutes home.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all young friends.

In our country, gold has become a part of social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the banks.
Now do not keep gold in home .
Once again, you will find gold in your hand in the Savarin Gold Bond.
But now we started it .
Therefore, there is no need to buy gold now.
This scheme, which will guarantee security, will be launched by the people of the country in the coming weeks.
I am also happy to say that we are bringing gold coins and gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Why shouldn't we have an indigenous seal of our country
Therefore, in the coming week, we will be launching the five grams, ten grams of Ashok Chakra Bharati Gold Coins.
Besides this, 20 grams of gold can also be made available to the people.
I would like to assist you in bringing about a new transformation in the direction of this new scheme.
But one mantra - one should always be the medium for our thinking, for our behavior and for the method of individualism.
There is a diversity in India .
Several categories, sects, traditions, languages, different species and cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the only mantra.
Peace, harmony and unity - these are divine medicines for development.
Over the last several years, the "Run for Unity" programme has been organised across the country on 31st October.
Take the mantra forward.
Now all of you have been working on Diwali and have been cleaning your houses.
New goods can be purchased.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated everywhere in the country.
My best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
However, I will continue to hear a few words on Diwali day itself.
Therefore, I am particularly enthusiastic about my visit to Britain.
It is indeed a matter of study in the world of women empowerment for the Bhagwan Vishwaswara Prajaswamy many years ago.
The statue of Bhagwan Vishwaswar on the land of London will prove to be an excellent example of how the great men of India think far and wide.
In a country like India, we should learn multilingual languages.
I will also try to reach you in your language for 8 hours at night.
However, we have had a good bond.
The last year has been completed.
Now we are entering this new year.
Once again my best wishes to my beloved countrymen.
Prime Minister's Office PM's Mann Ki Baat Programme (Declaration) September, 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - Mann Ki Baat - One year, many words.
I dont know what you have achieved but I cannot say without saying that I have achieved so much.
The power of the people is immensely great in public life.
There is a prior thought in my life and I have a deep sense of respect for the power of the people.
However, in Mann Ki Baat Mann Ki Baat, I learnt through a talk programme, I mean, I got it, and I said that the power of mankind is even more difficult than we think.
Our ancestors say that people are a part of the blessed land.
But lakhs of people used to send me conscious messages.
It is a great power in itself.
These goals have taught me a big lesson.
It means that information should reach the top level from the bottom of the pyramid, which must go from the top to the bottom of the pyramid.
He said that this information is being translated into Mann Ki Baat Mann Ki Baat.
But this has happened.
In the same way, Mann Ki Baat - Mann Ki Baat has transformed into an urgent need to showcase the power of the society.
I urge all the citizens to look at the tourism sector in India, Incredible India, Friends, if you are going, if you are going, if you have a good photo then I will see it.
However, there has been a lot of trouble.
People from all corners of the country sent photographs like lakhs.
Peoples power is a discipline, an experience.
Once I have spoken in Mann Ki Baat Mann Ki Baat, the houses of the poor are illuminated and the children are crying.
It is difficult for the common man, the middle class and the lower middle class to leave the bill.
There is nothing from Siachen but from Kutch, but from Cameroop, Kashmir or Kanyakumari to Gony-Phone.
Fonds were done from all the places .
This is a pleasant experience.
He sent his message to all age groups.
I liked to hear some of the messages myself and I am very good.
My team is working on the rest of them.
However, the reason for this is that they cannot watch TV and listen to radio.
I am aware of the importance of radio for visually impaired.
I am seeing another new angle, how many good things they have told - it is enough to consciously awaken the government.
Pawan Acharya sent a message from Alwar, Rajasthan.
Soil is also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I had the privilege of spending two-three hours with our soldiers on Vinayak Chaturthi.
Our Armed Forces, Navy, Air Force, Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy, Navy
The war with Pakistan was completed 50 years in 1965.
In this context, an exhibition was organized at the India Gate in Delhi.
I had seen it very lucky.
Fighting in Hajipur, however, the day-long fighting took place in Ghani and Chamunda but the hailstorms cease to be seen in the victorious scenes of the Pass at Mandi and Hajipur.
The history will be linked to our heritage.
I would like to share a few days with you and your families - if you are around Delhi, I would like to have this darshan.
Don't go on seeing it as soon as possible.
I returned in two and a half hours.
A little boy ordered the Prime Minister, but the boy soon forgot his name.
For the first time since independence, the Parliament has been discussing the issue of cleanliness for hours.
I am seeing good in it .
The country's parliament also looks forward to discussing cleanliness.
On the one hand, the Parliamentarians, on the other hand the citizens of the country are talking about cleanliness.
And you know what Mahatma Gandhi will say.
He said that once he had to choose one of both freedom and hygiene, he would choose one of them for cleanliness and freedom.
Cleanliness is more important for Gandhiji than independence.
He said that he wants to know about the birth anniversary of Dr Din Dayal ji.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
Anything that is incurred or incurred in Rupees 5, or Rs. 50, will be paid to the last person.
This joy also gives you a little bit.
When I went to Kolkata in May, members of Subhash Chandra Bose's family came and met him.
He laid the foundation stone of Chandra Bose, the son of Sodurni.
Subhash Babu got the opportunity to spend the evening with joy and happiness with the family members.
Chandra Bose and his family members are in the fray for the last week and more than 50 members of the Subhash Bose family have come to the Prime Ministers residence.
But it is a matter of greater joy that I would never have had the opportunity to host such a great human family to visit the Prime Ministers residence in October.
This is why more than 50 members of Subhash Babu family are coming from different countries.
Is it a joyous moment for me
I have the invaluable right to be safe.
In the meantime, I have visited Kashi.
I met many people.
He also interacted with some other student of Kshitij Pandey.
Banaras Hindu University is gaining some degree in Central Universities.
However, at such a young age, we have seen physics related issues.
Whatever he said, he had a subtle knowledge, but his faith and belief.
I would like to extend my best wishes to all the children of the country on scientific issues.
Sometimes such things enjoy a little.
Sometimes our sky-high mates - half an hour .
But I will imbibe your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
It has been smooth once a month.
The Mann Ki Baat programme has been a year and you know it.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu uses radio
He launched the Azad Hind Radio with Weekly News Bulletin.
He used to manufacture radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Pass and Urdu.
I too have been talking to you in Akashwani.
My Mann Ki Baat - In my mind, the word has become meaningful and meaningful in your mind.
I am, but those transactions will be yours.
Your suggestions must be there.
Your suggestions will also benefit the government.
Resolution will enhance.
Mann Ki Baat , August 2015
Once I got the opportunity to tell words in my mind .
In the southern direction of Sudur, people are immersed in Oman Sabar and have celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan across the country.
The Government of India has entered many new ways for social social people .
11 crore households have been covered under this scheme since its inception.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of PBD.
Today, I am talking to you, to make Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana a massive one year ago.
Youth opportunities have also been found . In one year Bangking Rang , economy , names .
Do not stop opening of bank accounts.
We are connected to the poorest of the poor that they will get dollars from the bank.
These banks are yours, you don't leave them now.
I have brought them to you, it is your duty to continue buying them now.
Our bank accounts should be alive.
I don't think you'll keep up with it.
Incidents and violent events in Gujarat came to a standstill in the country.
Anything that happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel will cause distress and distress to the ninth country.
However, in a short span of time, the elders of Gujarat, my brothers and sisters, all of us have reconciled the situation.
He played a key role in tackling the situation unprecedentedly.
Peace, unity and harmony is the right path.
Their words do not obey, their way of speaking i. e.
I felt all this while I was amongst them.
I believe that there is a need to inform the world about the true nature of this world in accurate manner.
I am sure the love and affection of the Sufi community will reach this message far and wide.
I would also like to inform others that there is a need to understand the sufficient tradition of any of our mothers.
I am fortunate that I will get another opportunity in the near future.
Buddhist scholars from all over the world will come to Bodhgaya in India.
It gave me an invitation to participate in the event and it was a pleasure to invite me when I came to Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of our country, went to Buddha.
So far, I have proposed this in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
We have issued an Ordinance on earthquake.
The Ordinance will be extended on 31st August, 2019.
But there was a depth in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, we have taken this decision very quickly, not by the Department of Agriculture, but by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
You don't have to be a victim of fears.
It is common to recall the 1965 war as a student of Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also common to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
It is a comprehensive understanding to recall the trinity and dignity of India's Armed Forces.
Such historical events always inspire us.
Last week, I had the privilege of interacting with the people of the Sufi community. It was a pleasant occasion.
I have had the opportunity to interact with eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How should the laboratory be connected to the area
It has to be taken forward as an opportunity.
I have said in the following Mann Ki Baat programme: There is a lot of scope for students to move towards Vijnan Shastra, and there is a lot of opportunity for them.
Specifically speak to my young friends.
Everybody is running at the lower level which can also be the reason behind this .
The decision to liberate small enterprises from intervening will now approximately be implemented.
This is the first time that this meeting will be held in other countries outside America.
More than 50,000 adults and 13 lakh children in our country are still reproducing at the time of childbirth or at the time of childbirth.
As we get rid of polio, we also get rid of tetanus in case of maternal and infant mortality.
There are reports on dengue between this.
We should not make death so simple.
How much price is life .
Not paying attention to drinking water, not sanitation, these are causes of mortality - it is not possible.
Free Dengue Assessment Exams are available across 514 centres across the country.
Now we will not get the opportunity to change for the country but we have got the opportunity to live for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Sometimes due to lack of self-confidence, we are unfair to our youth.
I would like to say that this has been the centuries old.
My experience with youth is different.
Sometimes I talk to the youngsters - there is a lot to learn from them.
These are, he added, "Sande on Cycle".
Some say we're singing a cycle day in a week.
Mann Ki Bath , June 2019 .
Hello , my beloved country .
Sometimes our words were inspired to us .
How to spend my time in this middle you can imagine yourself .
On Sunday , the last Sunday , at 11 o'clock I felt as if something had lost .
Sure feels like that.
Probably this is not a regular program .
In this program there was life , it felt as if your mind was luxurious , heart was luxurious , therefore this program was very difficult for me .
But this Sunday has waited a lot .
In the last few months, many messages have come and people have also said that Mann Ki Baat is being missed.
It will be very good for me when I read them .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in how many acquaintances I put a question that it is your hiccup .
I can support your curiosity .
I also feel that those feelings can be divided with you .
But if they talk then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
In how many acquaintances , Jaypajayas , even before the end of Poling I was Baaldera .
Many people were discovered in it .
It's my turn, I have the chance to spend with me.
And now I can say this thing that because of the small break in the Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to fill the Kedar Valley in the solitary cave.
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
Never say that I do but definitely do .
Because you have that right on me.
In the matter of Kedar people were able to see how many positive things you were able to show attention to some positive things , many times in your words .
Sometimes the work of paying attention to my thoughts also keep talking to you .
People , country , society , problems , challenges , challenges in my sight along with bringing them in my sight .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , polluted pollutions keep trying to give their wrath to cleanliness .
That is , the results of a kind of problems are seen in your words in the society of the society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat is like a millennium of society.
The international power , strength , talent situated in the country is known by this .
There is a need to act by providing an opportunity to synergize those forces and talents.
One more thing to know through this Mann Ki Baat is that all 130 crore people want to participate actively and effectively in the development of the country.
You can imagine how much energy I get when I analysis such things .
Actually I didn't come, you brought me, sat down and gave me a chance to talk again.
With this feeling, we will take the tradition of Mann Ki Baat forward.
There was an obstruction in the mind of all people .
Therefore the country has given invitation to how many advantages for the protection of democracy besides its own profit .
Probably in any country where people of the world have not only put Ooty for the democracy of their rest , powers , needs , needs or not only for the democracy of the democracy of this country 77 -LRB- 77 -RRB- .
Today, in our country, how many big and big initiatives have been taken today, from the rich to the poor, everybody has participated in this festival with joy and zeal to decide the future of our country.
When something is near to us, we'll understimate it, even deny a maximizing facts.
This number may seem normal to us but if we go out of the world then we can say that most of the people of the rest of the world have lost their lives in comparison to any other country.
But how many people were put in numbers in 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America , approximately double .
The total number of Ooty in India is more than the population of Europe .
It indicates the magnitude of our democracy.
In 2019 the number of civilizations in the history of today is the biggest democracy of the world .
You can imagine how many acquaintances are needed in such a big condition that human power , arrangements are needed .
Lacs of students , rulers , officers , workers were troubled day and night it was possible .
Approximately three lakh Paramilitary Corps personnel took up their responsibilities to facilitate this memorandum of Democracy and 20 lakh police personnel from different states also worked at a very proud level.
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting has been done more than this time .
You can imagine 10 lakh Polling Stations across the country, over 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh Vivipaat (VVPAT) machines.
It has been done that no one Ooty should not come to the unforgettable condition of its Ooty .
A Polling Station has been set up for only one woman Ooty in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place of the world is in India .
It is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Not only this , there is also a chance of pride in these so many societies .
Perhaps for the first time in history women also participate in Ooting with enthusiasm like men .
The quantity of polio in many women , men is about equal .
Although the reality of enthusiasm is that in parlor today 78 -LRB- sex -RRB- women are epilepsy .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of me saying Book not only Book.
In welcome we pray to give books instead of flowers .
Approximately at many places such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, Nakewaro gave the book Prem Chand Ki Look Beloved Kahania.
It gave me a lot .
I could not find much time , when I was in delivery then I got a chance to read some stories again .
Their stories reflect the feelings of the whole of India .
While reading the story of 'Nasha', I looked at the economic imbalances of the society.
When I was young then I remembered how many nights were spent in this matter .

My first request - how the countrymen have pursued cleanliness and how we should start a public campaign for water conservation.
I am confident that water is the prasad of Parmeshwar.
In order to save one drop of water we should absorb one drop .
Talk about the problems of water in it , talk about the methods of conservation of water .
Specially, for the mainstream of various regions, for water conservation, I have to lead the innovative campaigns.
Leave film rang , let us not let our friends of media , but let the people of social institutions , not let the people of cultural heritage , but let everybody give this goal in their own way .
Wake up the society , do the society together , work together with the society .
Look , we must see changes before our eyes .

Italy is India 's heart if the mind starts becoming heavy .
The creator of ten days Bharatma had lost his sons .
These volunteers have lost their life for the protection of 125 crore people of the country .
For the people of the country to sleep peacefully these virtues save us from their sleeping .
Our weapons are always presenting unparalleled adventurous adventurous adventurous games .
Ram Niranjee, the father of Amarvir Ratna Thakur of Bagalpur in Bihar, has said in such a sad moment, the feelings that inspire all of us.
He told that he also sent his second son to fight with enemies , if necessary he will also fight .
Seeing the courage of the wife of the Amarvir of Jagsangpur of Orissa , seeing the courage of the wife of Prasanna , the country of Yavat worshipped her .
This smaller psychological psychologically it tells us all the small children of India .

The living witnesses situated in front of our eyes are the inspirational examples of India .
My beloved countrymen, when we came home, are we all waiting for a memorial of war
I am surprising , anxiety was not the memorial of national war in India .
It is a memorial to preserve the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation .
I decided to make such a memorial in the country .
We were very happy to fulfil this construction in a very little time to make one of the national war memorials .
To morrow , i . . February 25th honey , we gave this national soldiers to the army of this national soldiers .
It is a small attempt to fulfil their debt .
The memorial was organised close to the heart of Delhi, i. e.
It is believed that to see this national soldiers memorial is like a pilgrimage to the people of the country .
After the independence of the country this national soldiers given more sacrifices for the country are a symbol of thanksgiving thanksgiving thanks to the country .
The shape of this monument exhibits the unparalleled courage of our martyrs.
The National Military Memorial is based on four four concentration circules, the first circulation depicts the entire journey from birth to sacrifice.
The flag hoisting of the flag hoisting of the Amarkantak is a symbol of Amarkantak .
The second circle is the beauty chakra .
There is a queue of dense trees in this chakra .
Seeing on softness , to know about the important martyrs of our country , to tell them thanksgiving them , it has become a place to display this national memorial .
For staying with our lives , the country remains safe , for developing their lives are here .
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the important contributions of our weapons , police , Para Military teams .
In the last year in October I also got the luck of giving this national memorial to the country .
This national police memorial is a reminder of the thoughts that we have to express our gratitude to the women comparison to the police and other men for the protection of all of us.

Man Ki Bath , November 2018
On the 3rd day of October on the 3rd day of October , on the day of Vijayadashmi Festival Mann Ki Baat program was started .
Our Mann Ki Baat Dharawahi Yatra fulfils fifty years of our journey.
That is why this is our Golden Jubuli Associated , that is , the Swarna Festival of Italy .
This time phone calls , Uttaranchals coming from all of you have also proposed to recognize this Golden Festival .
Anshu Kumar of Delhi, Amar Kumar, Patna to Vikas Yadav at Mai Gau
They ask what they ask , people say that the technology of technology technology , social media is the medium of social media , mobile ypnotise is the person who is the person of mobile ypnotise .
But why did you choose radio between people to meet people
I'll tell you a story.
It was in 1998 .
It is time for me to work as an Institutional Member of the Indian Janta Party in Himachal Pradesh.
The cost of ' Bharat Bharat ' is lice .
I don't mean what I mean."
Then he said , Behold , listen to radio , it has been discussed on the same thing in radio .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayi Garden came forward , told that the American test was done on that day , how much of this tea was done in radio .
The power of radio was estimated .
After I became the prime minister it is natural to return my sight in the midst of the most powerful medium .
Fade Back coming in this survey is very interesting .
How much expansive church has also been done about the Puja Positive .
This is an example of the point of view of social , positive emotional feelings situated in the minds of all our country .
Because of the program of Man Ki Bath program the feeling of voluntary service has also increased in people .
People are coming forward at a big height for the society and this is a change .
Because of the program of Man Ki Bath I am very happy to change radio more favorite to people .
The northern , online trade , phones , phones , in all these the objects of the objects are clearly visible .
Modi comes and goes, but this country remains stable and our culture remains stable.
All these small stories of 130 crore people of the country remain alive forever .
All these give new inspiration to this country , how does the highest peaks with new enthusiasm .
My experiences also participate with water as well .
After that gradually this thing comes towards a change by buying the sugar of house , social meditation , vatsop .
Sometimes even the Prime Minister of Phone Collection is the victim of all the hardships he gives to the Prime Minister.
When will the government be able to fulfil the selfiewithdaughter propaganda from a small village in Haryana
Many times monkeys have also been identified for the adventurous adventurous but in my mind 130 crore people of the country are always present .
My heart is all of them .
Man Kei Bath is not the word of the government , this is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is a special India, a respected India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious .
If you want to answer your question easily then there is nothing to make .
Absolutely very simple job for me.
Every time people come north in front of Man Kibit .
In My Gau, Narendra Modi Mobile Yap, people share their thoughts, there is also a Toll free number 1800117800.
People done this November record their message with their throat .
More north , more expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive attempts to read themselves .
I myself hear a lot of phone calls .
Do not fall near the Man Ki Bath program , in the time of my journey I read how much of the thoughts that you have sent , infants .
Every moment all the people of my country are in my mind . Therefore who read any north , the conditions of north , their feelings become part of my thoughts .
This north is not just the piece of Kaiti .
Actually the name of those things i . . village , person etc . do the mouth of the description .
I would like to thank everyone present in Mann Ki Baat, for example, Bhavodav, Utjjain and Mann Ki Baat.
Their northern , expansive expansions are not able to read , then again the number of people sending north , trade is in lakhs .
An attempt is also made to bring the unparalleled norths, information and related areas to Mann Ki Baat.
It is said that radio , far-off , remaining T . . . channels , social meditations have also been told to all my partners in the middle of social meditation .
Because of their tribulation Man Kibit reaches most people .
Akashwani Vrindra Bandhan has been published in many languages .
Some people are listening to the sound of monkeys living near the throat in the province language as well .
In the same way they change the Nrandra Modi along with those three minutes .
Everybody has to listen to the program of Manki Bath in your language .
Everybody is considered to be less convenience about themselves , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
But the media has changed many things proposed in Man Kibit .
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Drugs Free India, selfie with daughter etc.
If you do not support then the journey of this monkey was incomplete .
"Thank you so much for your phone call, Gunnu.
If you want to say then there is no secret with me .
Our old things of our own life do not obstruct us , it is easy to understand anyone before .
Sometimes our paralysis gives the biggest obstruction to the conferences .
Not confessing , not confessing , trying to understand something instead of every action is my first importance .
I am trying to talk with youth in various programs or social meditations .
I am trying to understand that I am trying to understand .
It is very good to question the youth .
They're specialists in multi-tasking.
If we pay attention to our surroundings then social interference i . . Startups i . . Startups i . . or any other kind of changes in the society .
Does the youth adventurously adventurous dreams , big dreams
Youth thoughts are being brought upon the ground and given freedom to adopt them and they can bring about social changes in the country.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about the day of the state going on in Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i. e.
It is very special today , because we were emotionalizing the state , today we are asking in the seventyth year .
Blessed is the blessedness of your information .
In the three third depth all these Mahamahals gave us such an expansive , expansive state .
The shore built by an extraordinary speed is also an example of Time management cool , producing cycle .
It also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities during record .
It is the confluence of the great personalities of the country that the people of the country are empowered, the disadvantaged and the disadvantaged are capable of empowering each one of them.
About Hakullu , responsibilities our state has been described extensively that is the speciality of our state .
Both of these conveniences take the country forward in the life of the country .
On the identification of Nakinkka , in 2010 when 60 years of Indian state was completed , in Gujarat we swimmed on the elephant .
To encourage the state in youth , to encourage the state , to encourage their state it is an attempt to keep in mind that it has been done .
In the year 2020, we complete seventy-five years in the form of a Republic and we complete seventy-five years of our independence in 2022.
My beloved country , if we talk about the council of the kingdom , then the native Mahabharata standing at the center of the kingdom is unforgettable .
Praswamy Babasaheb is located in the nervous system of India .
What is the cost of Ganesha i . . copulation i . . copulation .

On the second time the priest Babasaheb Ambedakar reservoir is worshipped .
Guru Nanak Dev Garhwal was always along with the category of people .
He had always seen the way of truth , Karma , service , mercy , spiritual path .
In the coming year, the 550th Jayanti Festival of Guru Nanak Devji is celebrated with great pride in the country and the joy of these festivals spread across the world.
All the state governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival with gloriousness .
Similarly 550 Jayant Festival of Guru Nanak Regiri is celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train is also run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak Regiri .
I was reminded of the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Sahib when I attended a meeting related to it.
Due to the earthquake of Gujarat coming in 2001 the Gurudwara also got injured rapidly .
But the state government , local people associated with that Gurudwara provides an example to this day .
The Government of India has taken a major decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the tourists of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
Come , let us move ahead this journey .
Man Ki Bath , October 2018 .
On 31th October 31th honeymoon the favorite Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel reservoir of all us .
Like every year on that day also the country is ready to participate in the ' Run Fort ' running for Iueen ' .

Six and a half months before independence, on 27 January 1947, the world famous international journal 'Time Magazine' has published a collection of 'Time Magazine' on the journal 'Sardar Patel Record' on the journal.
The journal in its lead store has given the status of an India.
But it is not like the falling of India .
It is the falling of India divided into many parts .
There were approximately 550 national institutions in the country .
The interest of the British decreased in India but they wanted to go to India by pieces of pieces .
Time magazine has also made other stores of the life of man in his business .
It has been told that in the floods coming in Ahmedabad in 1920 how he was organised , how Bardoli museum was exhibited .
The guide of Sardar Patel has discovered every problem , fulfilled the impossible task of making the country comfortable .
All these India bound with the Ikta Sutra , seeing our Bharatmata we remember the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Reiki naturally .
Established on the Narmada River in Gujarat, the height of the statue is double the statue of liberty in America.
This is the biggest idol of the world .
The highest statue of Kella in the world is in our country that every Indian has now become pride .
Not only this the guide of Sardar Patel surrounded by earth now also increase the glimpse of sky .
It is natural to see this statue of every Indian .
It is my belief that the people of every corner of India consider this place to be an extremely beloved museum.
My beloved brother brotherhood , we celebrated all our country 's residents ' Infantry Day ' .
I am worshipping everyone in the Indian army .
I am also making a glimpse of their adventurous families of our soldiers .
But all the people of our country know why do you celebrate this ' Infantry Day ' .
On this day our Indian soldiers saved Kashmir from the Chorbet roads running on the grass of Kashmir .
For this historical incident also there is a direct relation with Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel .
I read one more important Indian army officer Taluku Old International -LRB- conversation -RRB- once .
In this conference Fidd Marshal Sammnekshaw , he remembered the days of his calculation .
At that time soldiers started fighting in Kashmir in October 1947 .
In the delay of sending the army of Kashmir the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had also been reminded in the memory of the Fall Marshal Sammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
My favorite country ' s favorite country , nobody likes to play .
Sports , strength , skill , capacity - all these are main .
These are a sports activity .
These four qualities are so important for any country construction .
The country which has all these qualities in the youth , that country not only economic , science , technology but also gives its victory in the year .
It is said that I had two museums .
Firstly in the Asian Para Games 2018 we got the opportunity to meet our para athletes .
In these sports, our para athletes have enhanced the pride of India by producing a record of 72 dimensions.
Every part of this para athletes got the luck of meeting themselves.
Similarly , the summer yatth Holympics 2018 has got the opportunity to meet the summer done in Arjuntina .
You will be pleased to know that in the Yath Olympics 2018, our youth will be more exhibited than ever.
In these competitions, our country has gained three other dimensions besides the thirteen dimensions of Mix event.
This time in Asia kids also our country will remember all yourself .
In some minutes how many times I am more than this , see whether it is more important than this .
India is not only in the year of Christianity but also in the way we have never imagined the new records of India .
He worked like cleaning DTC buses to save his life after coming out of the hospital and watering the Dhabal on the roadside in Delhi.
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , golden objects of India .
Not only this , see the capacity of increasing in India sports .
India has never had any Olympic measure in both Senior Level Camp and Junior Level in Judo.
But in the Europe Olympics the history of Tababi Devi has created the history of silver .
The youth sports activity of sixteenth century Tababi Devi resides in a village of Manipur .
If the father goes to the cooling , then the mother ' s fish was sold .
Many times there were no money for food in their house .
In such situation also the courage of Tababi Devi has not been lessened .
The history has created the neck for the country .
Every youngster, he is a recognition of Sports New India.
My beloved countrymen, you all will be remembered, we will be successful in the beginning of the FIFA U17 World Cup in 2017.
Youth is the most successful tournament.
We have also created a new paradigm in the number of accountants in the FIFA U17 World Cup.
More than twelve lakhs of stadiums from different places of the country enjoyed those football competitions , encouraged youth games .
This year, India got the fortune of hockey World Cup 2018 to be held in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Complex starts from 28 November to 16 December .
Any kind of sports playing Indian sports or on some sports Indian hockey is definitely interesting .
There is a golden history of India in Haki game .
The magician of Hakiki Mantra is known worldwide about Major meditation .
After that Balvinder Singh Sinior , Leslie Claudius -LRB- Leslie Claudius -RRB- , Mohammad Shahd , Uddham Singh has decided a very big journey from Dhanraj to Dhanraj .
These are giving inspiration to new waves playing games with their industry , handicrafts , handicrafts .
Watching the excitement of excitement competitions is a good opportunity for the games .
Going to Bhubaneswar yourself and watching hockey matches enjoy your games .
My beloved countrymen , many people are coming forward voluntarily to organise social programs and everybody is giving inspiration to all the people of the country .
We will be able to see this legacy everywhere in the society and everywhere in the society.
But in this new age , new generations are coming forward to do this task with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name 'self 4 societies ' . Myjov , the IT , electronic instrumentary of the country do not allow their employees to carry out social programs , so that they gave them the right opportunity to do this portal .
To run this program all Indians pride on seeing enthusiasm , faithfulness .
The society from ITDC , I am not , not pride , but the journey of crossing Samiti crossing Samiti is there in it .
Some children read , some elders are reading .
Some paying attention to cleanliness , some helps the rails .
There is no feeling behind all these . only the emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotionality .
A young man himself learned wheelchair baseball to help the wheelchair basketball team.
Mission mode activity i . . this interest is the feeling of dedication .
Definitely gets pride .
I am not the one that inspires all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time, if I look at your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen an interesting vision of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
What is in his guide , ' Bharatti Gijan traditions , customs , nature along with nature you should say in the program of Man Ki Bath .
Mansh Garu , such thing has been impossible for proposing you ahead of Mann Ki Bath .
It is a good opportunity to inspire us to return to our glorious culture and past that these are being discussed to protect the environment of the world, especially the western countries.
Our India also faces this problem .
For its result we should take the pill once in ourselves and see our history, traditions once again .
Specially we should know the lifestyle of our tribals that being embraced with nature is in the culture of our tribals.
Our tribal brothers worship the trees , trees , trees , fruits and goddesses .
The tribals of Bhilwara residents of Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region of Madhya Pradesh worship the trees of Arjun .
In the desert area like Rajasthan Vishnoi society has seen how to protect environment .
Especially in the matter of conserving trees they are ready to make their life soldiers but one tree does not allow harm to one tree .
It is believed that the Mishmi pestilence of Arunachal Pradesh is related to tigers .
Leopards are considered to be their garden .
In Nagaland also tigers are protected from forests .
The Goldens of Central India stop fishing in some places of the Cathen river in the Bridging Season .
Adivasis make their houses with natural substances which are also good for propagation along with being strong.
In south India a small cutting of smoke living in the solitary areas of Nilgiri Peeth in the south India is made by small things found in their locality .
It is true that my beloved brother Sodriman , the tribals believe that they will live a peaceful life together in themselves , but if someone loses their natural beauty then they will not be afraid of fighting for their rights .
My beloved countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we would recognise the people who have done extraordinary work for the society.
Seeing small , it has a very deep effect on those tasks .
I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab for some days .
A common Ratu Gurubachan Singh has been married with labour .
Before this marriage Guru Bachan Garhwal had married the parents of the parents , but I was a Sherut .
But all of you will be astonished by listening to a common driver Gurubachan asking Gurubachan , that is the true strength of our society .
Sri Guruban Singh has kept an example in front of us .
I read about another small village Kallar Majra situated near Nabha of Punjab .
Why did this village come to the church of Karlar Majra , where the people there instead of burning grains in the field , instead of burning them in the field , they are covered inside the soil , how much technology is necessary for it .
The brother Guruban Singh is my opinion .
To keep the environment clean for the people of Kallar Majra , to keep the environment clean .
Your clean lifestyle is moving ahead in the reality of Indian tradition .
On occurrence of drops , wheels , small precautions , good tasks , social tasks , always play an extremely important role in making the environment of social environment .
We establish peace at every place in life , heart , in me , in every part of the world .
The 11th honey coming to India is special because the first World War was completed in November 1111 .
The end of the war was completed , when the heavy destruction occurring , people completed one century after fulfilling the destruction .
First world war is a major incident of India .
If we want to say properly then we have no relation with unconscious war .
Even then our soldiers were fighting with so much virtue , how big role was played , gave maximum sacrifices .
On coming to war Indian soldiers had seen the world to take them away .
In rare places , poisonous situations also our soldiers have seen their beauty .
All these are behind one goal - to restore peace.
First world war has seen the world 's destination .
According to estimates approximately one fort soldiers , other fort people had lost their lives .
Therefore peace is so important that the world knows how important .
In the last bridge the meaning of peace has changed .
Italy is peace , sadness meaning not only war .
Change in the environment from acute pain , economic development has to change the social judgment of social judgment .
Nirodh is the true signal of the development of the person .
My beloved country , our north-eastern states are different .
The natural beauty of this place is estimated that the people here are extremely different .
This award, which gives you for best policy embracing in this hole, is similar to the Oscars in that hole.
Not only this , we had discovered this archaeological excavation crossing fifty naminated milk from twenty five countries of Sikkim .
For this I told the people of Sikkim many opinions .
My beloved country , October has happened .
There are many changes in the environment also .
Along with this the weather of festivals has also come . Dhan Terracotta , Deepavali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat . if you want to say a different kind of festival in the month of November .
All these festivals of the country are many luxuries of all these festivals .
All of you want that in these festivals not only your health but also keep in mind your health .
For making new decisions also these festivals give opportunity .
With a mission mode, I would like to make these festivals an opportunity for you to move ahead in life.
Your development is an important part of the development of the country.
How much development has happened to you that the country will progress as much as the country .
All of you are my many luxuries .
