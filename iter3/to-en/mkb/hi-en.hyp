My dear countrymen, Namaskar
My best wishes to you all on Diwali
We have been told - Shubham Karoti Kalyan, Health, Dhansampadam
In this verse, it is said that light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which shows goodwill by destroying the opposite intellect.
I bow down to such a divine light
To remember this Deepawali, what could be a better idea than to expand the light, spread positivity and pray to destroy the feeling of hostility
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world
The special thing is that it not only includes the Indian community but now the governments of many countries, the citizens of that place and the social organizations of that place celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way , India stands there
Friends, Festival tourism has its own attraction in the world.
Our India, which is the country of festivals, has immense possibilities of festival tourism as well.
Our effort should be to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu and also to include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
Every state, every region has so many festivals of its own. People from other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided that we will do something different on this Diwali.
I had said that let us celebrate the women power and achievements of India on this Deepawali, i. e.
And immediately after that, there was a lot of inspiring stories on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh of Harangal wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power.
My mother is God for me
Everything is for me and that is India ' s Lakshmi in the true sense .
Ramesh Ji, I salute your mother
Geetika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says that Major Khushboo Kanwar is Lakshmi of India who is the daughter of Bus Conductor and led the All-Commen detachment of Assam Riles.
For Kavita Tiwari ji, India's Lakshmi is her daughter, which is also her strength.
They are proud that their daughter paints the best
He's got a very good Rank in the ATE exam.
Megha Jain ji has written that a 92 year old woman from Ninety Two Years provides free water to passengers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Megha ji, inspired by the humility and compassion of Lakshmi of this India.
Many such stories have been shared by people
You must read, take inspiration and share something like this yourself and I respectfully bow down to all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the renowned poetess of the 17th century Sanchi Honnamma, he wrote a poem in the 17th century, in Kannada, in the Kannada language, that expression, that word, every Lakshmi of India, this is what we are talking about or not.
It seems as if its foundation was created in the 17th century itself.
How wonderful words, how wonderful expressions and how excellent ideas are in this poem of Kannada language
Pannida Parmegondanu Himavantanu, Pannida Bhrigu Parchidanupennida Jankarayanu Jasuvalendanu i.e. Himavantaraja, due to her daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu got fame due to her daughter Lakshmi and Raja Janak got fame due to her daughter Sita
Our daughters are our pride and they have a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day when 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak Devji ' s influence is not only in India but in the whole world .
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget my visits to the gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji that I can share with you, but for this, many episodes of Mann Ki Baat will take place.
He always kept the service paramount
Guru Nanak Devji believed that there can be no cost of selfless service .
They stood firm against social evil like untouchables
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji conveyed his message to the world, far and wide.
He was one of the highest travelers in his time .
They went to many places and wherever they went, they won the hearts of everyone.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji performed several important religious voyages, which are called sadness
A message of goodwill and equality, whether it is north or south, east or west, they visit people everywhere, saints and sages
It is believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him .
He visits the holy land of Haridwar
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi. It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed there.
He went to religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Visit to Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Sri Lanka in the South
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water there.
In Bidar, there is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb which reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, it is dedicated to him.
During a sad hour, Guru Nanak ji visited Kashmir and its neighbourhood in the North.
It established a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev ji also went to Tibet, where people, considered him a guru
They are also revered in Uzbekistan, where they had traveled.
During one of his sadness, he had also visited Islamic countries on a large scale, including Saudi Arab, Iran.
Just a few days ago, Ambassador of the White Five Countries of about 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and all this happened on the occasion of the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji .
All these ambassadors not only visited the Golden Temple but also got an opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Thereafter, many Ambassadors shared pictures of social media with great pride and good experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the 31st of October.
Sardar Patel also looked at the finest things in depth and examined them.
In fact, they were Man of Detail
At the same time he was also a master in organizational skills .
He had mastered plans and strategy formulation
When they read and listen about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, they will find out how powerful his planning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in Nineteen Twenty One.
Sardar Patel was responsible for the entire arrangement of the session
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
He approached the farmers and urged them to make khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to delegates
Putting shoes in these bags, keeping them with you ended the tension of shoes stolen from the delegates' mind.
On the other hand , Khadi sales also increased considerably .
Our country, Sardar Patel will always be grateful for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly
He did a vital job of ensuring fundamental rights so that there was no scope for any discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did a great job of uniting the princely states and doing a very big work.
Actually, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in certain provinces in the integration of the country.
He also played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947 , our neighbour looked at Lakshadweep and he sent the ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel came to know about this, he lost his time without delay, he immediately started rigorous action.
And the tricolor was hoisted therein , and destroyed it at the sight of every neighbour of Lakshadweep .
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
It ' s also an attractive tourist destination
I hope you all will visit its beautiful islands and beaches
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October, 2018, the day when the Statue of Unity in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
It ' s the tallest statue in the world
The US - based Statue of Liberty is double in height
The tallest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride
Every Indian's head is lifted up with pride
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that on an average, eight and a half thousand people visited the magnificence of Statue of Unity every day.
And now the centres of attraction like Hactus Garden, Batterly Garden, Jungle Saari, Hildren Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery are continuously developing and the local economy is also getting new employment opportunities.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the upcoming tourists, many villagers are providing homes and homes.
Professional training is also being provided to people who provide Come Stay Accessibility.
The people there have started cultivating ragon ruits and I am sure it will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We all are witness to how within a year a place develops as a world famous tourism destination.
People from all over the world come there
A lot of systems of transport, lodging, guides, eco-friendly systems are developing automatically after each other.
There is a huge economy developing and people are creating facilities according to the requirements of the passengers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, the National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country at all costs.
On 31st October, every time Run for Unity is being organized
It will include people from every section of the society, every section of the society
Run for Unity is a symbol of this thing, this country is one in one direction and wants to achieve one goal.
One Target - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat II
It has been observed in the last five years - not only in Delhi but also in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the capitals, in the district centres, in small tier-III cities, there are plenty of men, women, city dwellers, village dwellers, youngsters, elderly people, persons with disabilities.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting a passion and passion for marathon.
Run for Unity is also a unique provision.
Running mind-brain and body is beneficial for everyone .
It's going to run here too.
At the same time, we are also associated with Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, this purpose.
And that is why not just the body, mind and rituals to take India to new heights for India's unity
And so you can find out about Run for Unity around you in any city you live in.
In this portal, information has been given about places across the country where Run for Unity is to be organized.
I hope that all of you will run on October 31 - for the unity of India and for the fitness of yourself.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel erected the country in the form of unity
This mantra of unity is like a ritual in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every turn, at every juncture.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to empower the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around you, we will find many examples that have been continuously working to enhance mutual harmony, but sometimes it happens that the efforts of the society, its contribution and contribution gets disappeared very soon from the memory panel.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court pronounced its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi
Interest Groups were playing games to take advantage of those situations in their own way.
What kind of language was spoken to create warmth in the atmosphere
But it continued for five days, seven days, ten days, but as the decision came, a joyous, surprising change was felt by the country.
On one hand, everything had happened for two weeks but when the decision was taken on the Ram Janmabhoomi then the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and saints gave a very balanced and restrained statement.
Whenever I remember that day , I am happy .
Honoured the dignity of the judiciary very gloriously and did not allow any warmth, tense atmosphere to be created anywhere.
These things should always be remembered , it gives us a lot of strength
That day, that moment, is a duty for all of us
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the country.
I pay homage to them today
My dear countrymen, today, if one story of every household is heard far and wide, one story of every village is heard - from north to south, from east to west, from every corner of India, one story is narrated to cleanliness.
But there ' s also a pleasant experience and interesting experience
I heard, I think, I'll tell you, too.
You imagine, the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature goes minus 50-60 degrees minus
Hoygen in the air is also merely a name
In such adverse situations, living in the midst of such challenges is not less than a valour.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but also running the Swachh Siachen campaign there.
I compliment the countrymen for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army .
thank you .
It's so cold that it's hard to decompose anything.
In such a situation, segregating and managing garbage is a very important task in itself.
In such a scenario, removing 130 tons of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding areas and how big a service is between the ragile eco-system of this place.
We all know that this Siachen is a glacier which is a source of rivers and clean water, so running a cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water for those who live in the lower areas.
They also use water from rivers like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that brings a new consciousness into our lives.
And in Diwali, especially buying something new, bringing something from the market in a small amount is required in every family.
I once said we should try - - buy local things
We don ' t have to go to the tehsil if we get what we need from our village
If found in Tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
As much as we will try to buy our local items, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I keep insisting that we must buy something or the other from the hand of our weavers and our Khadi people.
In this Diwali too, you might have purchased a lot before Diwali but many people think that if they go after Diwali they will get a little cheaper.
So there ' s a lot of people who ' ll still have to buy .
So along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I will urge you to come and buy local items.
See, we can also play an important role in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
We use a variety of crackers in Diwali.
But, sometimes there is a fire in carelessness
gets injury somewhere.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm .
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Will he have control over his own life and fortune
Revered Bapu can remember that Jantar
Can we imagine while shopping that what I am buying will benefit the citizens of my country
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion
Rakshabandhan ' s festival is a symbol of love and faith between sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many stories in the history of the country in which a defence formula had linked the people of two different states or religions with the bond of faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also going to come.
The entire atmosphere is going to echo with the glory of elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal and Govinda.
The joy of swinging in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Rakshabandhan , Sanskrit day is also celebrated on Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in tolerating, riding and conveying this great heritage to the common man.
Every language has its own importance, India takes pride in the fact that Tamil is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians are proud of the fact that from Vedic times to the present, Sanskrit language has also played a very big role in spreading knowledge.
Sanskrit language and its literature are the storehouse of knowledge related to every field of life .
Whether it is science or technology or agriculture or health, be it astronomy or architecture or be it maths or be it economics or be it environment or be it the mantra of dealing with the challenges of global warming is mentioned in detail in our Vedas.
You will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which infinite words are possible
Sometimes they use lions and poetry but those who are familiar with the well-wishers of Sanskrit know that in very few words such accurate statement is made by the well-wishers of Sanskrit.
As has been asked to explain the importance of the guru in life - Akshramastu, Guru: disciple Prabodhyat
We all celebrate the upcoming Teachers Day with this feeling
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teachers Day throughout the country
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day. I also congratulate you for your dedication towards science, education and students.
The scorching trees and plants from the heat provide relief to the dry reservoirs, but sometimes it also brings excessive rain and devastating floods.
There is a situation of nature that in some places there has been more rainfall than others .
Floods in Kerala have severely affected the lives of people
Today, in these difficult situations, the whole country stands with Kerala
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their loved ones and the loss of their lives cannot be compensated. But I want to assure the bereaved families that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity will go healthier as soon as possible.
I am sure that Kerala will soon be resurrected on the strength and indomitable courage of the people of the State .
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something or the other at their own level so that wherever there is an objection, be it Kerala or the other districts of India or be it areas or be it areas, peoples lives can become normal again.
All age groups and people associated with every field of work are contributing.
Everyone is engaged in ensuring that the trouble of the people of Kerala can be reduced to the minimum.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala
They left no stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood
I also want to specially mention the hard work of NRC jaws .
He has done a very good job in this moment of crisis .
The ability of NHRC to consolidate the situation by making their commitment and quick decisions has become a new centre of faith for every Indian.
Yesterday was the festival of Onam. We will pray that the festival of Onam will give strength to the country and especially to Kerala so that they can recover from the disaster at the earliest and the development journey of Kerala will get a boost.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and other parts of the country that the entire country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to mind
Then the subject on which people from all over the country wrote the most is the subject of all of us, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapn Bannerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, many innumerable people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and Mygov urging me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
On August 16, as soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise, everyone was drowned in mourning
A nation leader who quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way , for the past 10 years , he had gone far from active politics .
News did not appear anywhere, publicly noticed
Over the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come to the fore.
People remember him as an outstanding MP, a sensitive writer, an outstanding speaker, a popular Prime Minister
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act.
This change made two important changes in India's politics
First of all, the size of the cabinet in the states was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats
Secondly, the limit set under the anti-defection law was increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Clear guidelines were also set for disqualification of defectioners.
For many years, the political culture of forming a huge cabinet in India was created not only for the division of big cabinets but also for the pleasure of politicians.
Atal ji changed it
Their move saved money and resources
With this, efficiency also increased
It was a perspective like Atal ji who changed the situation and healthy traditions flourished in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure there was a change in the time of presenting the budget .
Earlier , according to the tradition of the British , the budget was presented at 5 p . m . in the evening because at that time there was time for Parliament to start in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 a.m.
Several rules have been made in this code, making it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
Because of this, more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag
Thus they brought our beloved tricolor to the people .
Similarly, nowadays you are seeing that the discussion about holding the elections of the Centre and the States together in the country is going on.
People are keeping their points in both the sides of this subject and the opposition
This is a good thing and auspicious sign for democracy
I would definitely say that developing good traditions for a healthy democracy, consistent efforts to strengthen democracy, carrying forward discussions with an open mind will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay tribute to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Just a few days back the monsoon session of Parliament has ended
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and the Rajya Sabha has 74.
Emerging above the Dalhousie, all MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and as a result of this, the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and the Rajya Sabha 14 bills.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of Social Justice and Youth Welfare
Several important Bills that benefit youth and backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades, there was a need to create a BCC commission like the SCST Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, this time the country has fulfilled its resolution of forming a BCC and gave it a constitutional right.
This step would prove to be advancing the objective of social justice .
Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed in this session
This law will further safeguard the interests of the SC and ST community
At the same time, it will prevent criminals from torturing and will be trusted in Dalit communities.
No civilized society can tolerate any injustice against the women power of the country .
The country is not ready to tolerate the culprits of rape, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made the provision of harshest punishment.
The culprits of misbehavior will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls under 12 years of age.
You must have read in the newspapers a few days ago in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, a court has sentenced two convicts of rape to death after just two months of hearing.
Earlier , a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh sentenced the culprits to death after just five days of hearing .
Rajasthan has also made similar quick decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crimes against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
However , this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible . I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands with full force to bring them justice .
When we move ahead in the country, changes can be brought about in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time in the monsoon session, everyone has presented an ideal.
These days crores of countrymen are focused on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning, people first look at newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won the medal.
Asian Games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country
My best wishes to those sportspersons who are yet to compete.
Indian sportspersons are performing well especially in Shooting and Restalling but our players are also bringing medals in those games where our performance has not been so good before, like sports like Hushu and Rowing - these are not just medals - proof of the zeal and dreams of Indian sportspersons
Increased number of medal winners for the country include our daughters and this is a very positive sign - even among the young players who win medals, we are 15-16 years old
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won the medal are from small towns and villages and they have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts as well as pay my hockey magician Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good performance.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day
Namaste Spirit, I respect your spirit
All of us have seen the construction of houses and buildings from bricks and stones but can you imagine that about twelve-and-a-half years ago, a huge mountain that was just a single stone mountain was given the shape of an excellent, huge and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but that was the temple - Kailashnath temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra
If someone tells you that a pillar of more than 60 meters of granite was constructed about a thousand years ago and a 80 tonnes of granite rock was placed on its summit then will you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible mail of architecture and engineering can be seen
Everybody is surprised to see the eleventh century ueen ' s splendor in Patan in Gujarat .
India has a Land Engineering Laboratory
There were several engineers in India who made unimaginable and presented examples of miracles in the engineering world.
In our legacy of the great engineers, we also got a gem of jewels whose work is still amazing to the people and it was Bharat Ratna Dr. M.
He is revered in that part of the country and the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and intimacy.
In their memory , September 15 is made as Engineers Day
Following his footsteps , our country ' s engineers have made a distinct identity all over the world .
When I talk about the miracles of the engineering world, I am reminded of an incident in 2001 when a terrible earthquake struck Kutch.
At that time I was working as a volunteer and I got the opportunity to visit a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age. And she was laughing at me. And she was saying, Look, this is my house in Kutch.
But somewhere you didn ' t see any damage
These houses were constructed by our ancestors according to the nature of this place and they were saying this thing with so much pride. So I got the idea that what kind of compositions our engineers had done in accordance with the local conditions centuries ago, due to which the common man was safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Should workshops at the location
What are the new things we need to learn in the changed age
The world is struggling with natural calamities
So what is the new form of structural engineering
What are her courses
What students should be taught
How does Hero waste become our priority
We must think about many such things when engineers celebrate Day.
There is an atmosphere of festivals and along with this preparations for Diwali also begin .
We will continue to meet in Mann Ki Baat, we will continue to talk about Mann Ki Baat and we will continue to move forward with our hearts.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all
Thank you
will meet again .
There are reports of good rainfall in many places these days .
At some places there is news of anxiety due to excessive rainfall and people are still waiting for rains at some places.
India's vastness, diversity and sometimes rain shows the form of preference and dislike, but what should we blame the rain, it is man who chose the path of struggle with nature and consequently, it is the result of this that sometimes nature becomes rough on us.
And that is why it becomes our responsibility to become a lover of nature, a protector of nature, a promoter of nature, a balance in what is given to nature remains in itself.
A similar incident of natural calamity in the past attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked the human mind
You must have seen on TV, 12 young football players in Thailand went to the cave to roam their coach.
It usually takes a few hours to go into the cave and get out of it.
But on that day , fortunes had no place .
When they went deep inside the cave , suddenly heavy rains caused a lot of water to accumulate near the cave door .
You can imagine that in adolescence, when death appears and you have to spend moments then how will it be
On the one hand, he was facing a crisis, on the other hand, humanity was united all over the world and manifesting the humanitarian qualities of God.
People all over the world were praying to take these children out safely
Everyone, be it the government or be it the parents of these children or be it their families or be it media or be it the citizens of the country, everyone has done a wonderful job of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in their mission as a team.
In this entire operation, a young Thai Navy soldier lost his life.
The whole world is amazed at the bravery and patience in a dark cave full of water in spite of such difficult situations .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things
We just need to focus on our goal with a calm and stable mind, keep working for it.
In the past, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us.
Neeraj ji had a special feature - hope, trust, determination, faith in himself
However , the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
Because this is the time when collages have a peak season
Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to colleges
If February and March visit Deams, Papers, Hanswers, then in April and May holidays, results, directions in life, carriage chores are spent in this.
July is the month when the youth step in a new phase of their lives when they move away from the occupations to the cut-off.
The attention of the students goes from home to hotel
Students come under the shadow of professors from the shadow of parents.
I am sure my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of collage life.
For the first time going out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a protective environment has to become a charioteer.
For the first time so many youngsters leave their homes and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students must have joined their own colleges so far, some will be joiners.
I would like to say to you people: Be calm, enjoy life, enjoy life and enjoy life.
There is no choice, no study has to be done without books, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own value .
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, making and maintaining new friends, it is a very wise thing in itself.
Learn something new, like new skills, new languages.
Young people who have left their homes and have gone to some other place outside their homes should discover those places, know about them, know about language, culture, tourist places there - go there, know about them
My best wishes to all the youngsters who are starting a new innings
His father raises garbage and raises his family
I congratulate them for their success .
There are many students belonging to a poor family and they have done something by their hard work and perseverance that inspires us all.
Bitiya Afreen Shaikh of Ahmedabad, whose father runs auto rickshaw, the daughter of Nagpur is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand, whose father works in brick kiln.
Ramesh himself used to sell toys in the fair or Anushka Panda, the divyang daughter of Gurgaon, who has been suffering from a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy, all of them have achieved such a success by crossing every obstacle with their determination and enthusiasm.
If we look around , we ' ll find many such examples
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to recite the sky to the earth. I have to call every darkness in the light. I have to smell the sword with the smell of flowers. And to awaken the mountains of Ga-ga.
The incident was that once I was discussing with the Indian youth in San Jose City, which is known as Technological Hub.
I had appealed to them to think about how they can use their talent for India and do something after taking time out.
I had appealed to convert Brain-rain into Brain-Gain
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly prepared a SmartGaon App using their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile phones.
Residents of Taudakpur village in Rae Bareli, Village-Prime Minister, District Magistrate, all of them made people aware about the use of this app.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will be noticed that the youngster is living in the USA and living in the midst of it. He must have left India several years ago but he still knows the nuances of his village, understands the challenges and is emotionally connected to the village.
That's why, perhaps, he could make something in line with what the village needs.
Every Indian naturally has a sense of attachment to his village, his roots and of doing something for his country.
But sometimes because of time, sometimes because of distances, sometimes because of ecological conditions, a slight ash gets accumulated on it, but if a small spark gets touched then all the things emerge again and they bring it back to their past days.
It has not happened in our case, the situation, the situation, the distances have not separated us, the ashes have not been frozen.
Santosh ji thank you very much for your Phone Hall
Actually Pandharpur Wari is a unique journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July, is also celebrated as the grand culmination of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy city in Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15 - 20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi in Warkari i . . pilgrims proceed on foot for a journey of Pandharpur with palanquins .
This journey, which is called Vari, includes millions of warkari
The footsteps of great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram walk towards Pandharpur instead of singing Vitthal-Vittal in a palanquin.
Pilgrims reach there for their viewing Lord Vithal , who is also called Vithova or Pandurang .
Lord Vitthal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense reverence and devotion.
Visiting Vithova Temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty and spiritual joy have a different experience.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Wari once they get the opportunity.
Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - countless saints are still educating the masses in Maharashtra.
They have been giving strength to fight against superstition and in every corner of India, this saint tradition has been inspiring.
We receive important messages of harmony, love and brotherhood from them, be it their brotherhood or disobedience.
It gets the mantra of fighting the society with reverence against superstition
These were the people who from time to time stopped the society, showed a mirror and ensured that the old evil practices were eliminated from our society and people had rituals of compassion, equality and purity.
This is our Indo-Bhumi Bahuratna Vasundhara, like a great tradition of saints in our country, in the same way the great men who have dedicated their lives to the powerful mother India have sacrificed their lives to this land.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression on many Indians .
We remember Tilak jis birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence
They had the power and wisdom to show the mirror of their mistakes to the British rulers .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to sedition him thrice in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I want to put an interesting event in front of the countrymen attached to Lokmanya Tilak and one of his statues in Ahmedabad.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad nearly a hundred years ago and during this visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel got the opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 01, 1920, he had decided that he would build his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality and immediately he chose Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and this Victoria Garden was named after the ueen of Britain.
Finally, the statue was completed and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not only from anyone but from 28 February 1929 to Mahatma Gandhi. And it is a matter of great pleasure that at that inaugural function, revered Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only received one person but has also got the courage to build the statue of Tilak ji.
And my dear countrymen, the uniqueness of this statue is that it is a rare statue of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, in which he has written just below Tilak, Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of the British.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav started with the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji
Public Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium to promote traditional reverence and festivities as well as social awakening, collectiveness, harmony and equality among people
There was a time when it was necessary that the country should be united to fight against the British. These festivals worked to unite everyone by breaking the barriers of caste and creed.
Over time the popularity of these events has increased
This shows that our younger generation still has a craft towards our heroes of our ancient heritage and history.
Today, in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh Pandal in almost every street.
This is a great opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like leadership and organisation, and develop them within themselves.
I had requested for the last time too and when I remember Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would once again urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival, celebrate it with great fanfare, but urge you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav.
Everything from Ganesh ji's statue to decorative material should be eco-friendly. And I would like that every city should have different competitions for eco-friendly Ganesh Utsav, they should be rewarded. And I would like that things on MyGov and Narendra Modi App should be kept eco-friendly for the massive publicity.
I will surely convey your message to people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self-confidence among the countrymen. He had slogan Swaraj is our birthright and we will carry it.
Today is the time to say that Swaraj is our birthright and we will carry it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and development results
I ' m talking about Chandrasekhar Azad
What kind of youth will there be in India who will not be inspired by listening to these lines Sarfaroshi's desire is now in our hearts, it is in our hearts. These lines have inspired many youths like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad.
His passion for the bravery and freedom of Chandrashekhar Azad has inspired many youth
Azad put his life on the claim, but he never bowed in front of foreign rule
I am fortunate to have got the privilege of going to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also got an opportunity to pay homage and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was a brave man who did not want to die by the bullets of foreigners.
Once again I respectfully bow down to two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has made history by winning the Gold Medal in the 400m race in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Inland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, in response to my letter, emailed me from Indonesia and she is currently preparing for the Asian Games.
-Mail writes unity: The most important moment in the life of any athlete is when he catches the tricolor and I am proud that I did that.
Ekta is also proud of you
You have illuminated the country
Unity has won Gold and Bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 in Tunisia
His achievement is special because he made his challenge the medium of his success .
Daughter Ekta Dreaded in 2003, half of her body failed due to road accident, but this daughter did not lose courage and gained this position by strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji has won gold medal in discus 3rd in Para Athletics Grand Prix in Berlin and Sundar Singh Gurjar has won gold medal in javelin.
My dear countrymen, in the month of August, many events of history are filled with festivities but sometimes the disease also enters the house due to the weather.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for the month of August and for the centuries-long festivals.
Again , indeed , we shall meet for a matter of mind .
greetings
My dear countrymen, once again I am fortunate to be with you all in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
Just a few days ago a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore .
You must have understood very well that I am talking about the Test match between India and Afghanistan
This was Afghanistan ' s first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India .
In this match, both the teams performed well and Rashid Khan, a baller from Afghanistan, did this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, tagged me on his twitter and wrote that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
It is the asset of the world of cricket and at the same time he did not even write in a slightly funny way, we are not going to give it to anybody.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us
Well , this was the first match , so it ' s very natural to remember , but I ' ll remember this match for a particular reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What a winner team can do while taking the trophy What did they do
- While taking the trophy, the Indian team from Afghanistan, which was playing international match for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and both teams took photos together
What is sportsman spirit, what is sportsmanship - we can feel from this one incident
Sports is an unprecedented way of uniting society and exploring the talent of our youth.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, there was a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world was united
Whether it is the European Parliament in Bresil or the headquarters of the United Nations in New York or the Japanese Navy fighter ships, everywhere people can see Yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic yoga programme and I was told that a lot of postures were demonstrated by women.
India and China troops jointly practice Yoga on the high snowy peaks of Ladakh
Yoga works to break all boundaries, add
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this occasion a big festival by going beyond all forms of caste, religion, region, colour or gender.
If people from all over the world were so enthusiastic and participating in Yoga Day programmes then why would not the enthusiasm in India be multiplied
Our Air Force fighters shook everyone by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky.
The sight was that they did floating in the air, not sitting in the airplane.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has worked beyond caste, creed and geography to unite people all over the world. We have lived for centuries the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, sages and saints who always insist on, Yoga has proved it in the true sense.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives
On MyGov and NarendraModiApp, many people have written to me that I should talk about the Hoctors Day on July 1 in the matter of Mann Ki Baat
We are the people who naturally worship mother as God, believe in equality with God because mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, so many times the doctor revives us.
The role of a doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today, the doctor does not have medical expertise but he also has a deep experience about the general life style trends and how it affects our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark all over the world with their capabilities and skills
Eminent in medical profession, along with hardworking, our doctors are known for solving complex medical problems.
We are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India
India has a rich history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which no historical event has happened.
Look , everywhere in India has its own legacy
There is a saint, a great man, a well-known person, everyone has their own contribution and greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on the 28th and anyway when I was in Gujarat, you are well aware of the Kabirvad of Gujarat.
When I used to work there, I had also organized a national convention of people belonging to the tradition of Saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabirdas ji had gone to Maghar
At that time there was an impression that the person who dies in Maghar does not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that leaves in Kashi goes to heaven
Maghar was considered unclean , but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it .
They broke the evils of their time and the superstitions of their time , and so they forgot , and they took the samadhi .
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his witnesses and couplets.
These were their ideals
This is the ideal we see in his writings , and in today ' s era , he is equally inspiring .
The true Peer Saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of others, who do not know the sufferings of others, they are ruthless.
Kabirdas ji laid special emphasis on social harmony
They thought far ahead of their time .
Put it on yourself, pity all coy
In another couplet, Kabir writes - where mercy is the religion, where greed and sin
He said: - Do not ask the caste sadhu, ask the knowledge
This is the greatness of the guru and such a guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Keep inspiring for centuries those who showed the way to millions of people
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
wherever they went , they took many initiatives for the betterment of society .
The system of a kitchen free from social discrimination, where every caste, creed, religion or sect could come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and excitement
I urge you all to think about the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji, how it should be celebrated in the entire society and around the world, how new ideas, new suggestions and new imaginations should be made and we should make this Prakash Parv inspired with great pride.
My dear countrymen
India's freedom struggle is very long, very broad, deep and full of countless martyrdom.
There is another history associated with Punjab .
In 2019, even 100 years of the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh that shamed the entire humanity
We can all think about how we should remember the 100 years of this event. But we should always remember the immortal message that this incident has given us. This violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's birthday is on July 6 and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people would be aware that at the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bangla.
This was the first time that the British Sultanate was there and someone at the University of Kolkata had addressed the convocation in Bangla.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense, he had laid a strong foundation stone for Indias industrial development, had prepared a strong base, had prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field
He wanted India to develop big industries and also pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
They were quite passionate about the development of West Bengal .
The result of their understanding, discretion and activism is that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India and for this, he lost his life at the young age of 52.
We should always remember the message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, with the spirit of harmony and brotherhood, with a vision for Indias progress.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
I got the opportunity to know about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people beyond the files.
People talked about their resolve, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me, but it was a different kind of learning experience and what could be a moment of satisfaction in anyone's life due to the happiness faced by people during this period
When he heard the stories of a common man, his simple words touched his heart.
In far-flung villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to passports for the elderly people of villages through common service centres.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and does business by creating an ice-cream
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are providing affordable medicines by visiting villages nearby along with running medicine centres.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two-three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business
Not only this, he is also giving jobs to ten to fifteen people.
Students from schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school tinkering lab at a young age.
No wonder how many stories were there, no corner of the country would be there where people would not have to talk about their success.
In such an environment, when the common man comes with new hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, he is not credited with the government.
The incident of a small girl from a remote village also becomes an inspiration for 1. 25 billion Indians.
With the help of technology for me, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant, inspiring and it not only gives me the satisfaction of working but also gets the enthusiasm to do more.
Another new joy, another new zeal and enthusiasm of living for the poorest of the poor gets a new inspiration.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen
40-50 lakh people were involved in this video bridge programme and you have given me a new strength.
I once again want to express my gratitude to all of you
I always feel that if we look around, something good happens somewhere or the other.
There are people who do good
We can also experience the aroma of goodness .
One thing I noticed in the past and this is a very unique combination
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand, our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming and farming.
They came together with TED engineers and formed a simple prosperity trust and activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
They joined the farmers, made plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
The farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from the crop production to the marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the farmers' participation in the profits.
Separate seed-banks have been prepared for the crops to be good and good breed seeds.
Women see the functioning of this seed bank women have also been added
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am glad that these youngsters from the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have come out of their reach to connect with the farmer, to connect with the village, to connect with the fields and barns.
Once again, my country's younger generation will not know anything about their innovative experiments, whatever I might have to visit, what I might have to do, what some people might have known, but my best wishes to all those people who are continuously doing something good.
GST is going to be completed by one year. It was the dream of the people of the country of One Nation, One Tax, that has been transformed into a reality today.
I would like to give credit to the states if I want to give credit for this thing.
GST is a great example of cooperative federalism where all the states together took a decision in the interest of the country and after that such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and all of us can take pride in the fact that people of different political ideologies sit there, people from different states sit there, people of different states are states with different priorities. However, all the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been done with unanimous consent.
There used to be 17 different types of taxes in the country before the GST but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a celebration of integrity
In the past, there used to be a lot of complaints about Inspector Raj in the case of tax.
Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology.
With the introduction of GST, the check post was over and the movement of goods got faster, which not only saved time but also benefited a lot in the logistics sector.
GST will probably be the world ' s largest tax reform
Such a huge tax reform was successful in India because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST was ensured through manpower.
It is generally believed that such a large country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to stabilize it completely. However, the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the celebration of the honesty of the country is a result of the participation of the people of the country that within a year, this new tax system has become its place, has achieved stability and it continues to improve with its inbuilt system as per the requirement.
Through Mann Ki Baat once again you have got the opportunity to be the most compassionate
You will remember very well that six women commanders of the navy, one team has been on a sea trip for several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - I want to talk about them
These 6 daughters of India, their team has taken the lead in the development of the sea for more than 250 days.
NSC has returned to India on 21st May after traveling all over the world in Tarini and the whole country welcomed him warmly.
They traveled in different oceans and many seas and covered a distance of about twenty thousand nautical miles
It was the first incident in itself in the world
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet all these daughters, listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters for enhancing their adventure, for enhancing the dignity of Navy and especially the world that the daughters of India are not less - I congratulate them for conveying this message.
Sense of adventure who does not know
If we see the developmental journey of mankind then progress has been made in the koch of some adventure.
Development takes birth in the lap of adventure.
I can do something about doing something, doing something out of the leak, doing something extra ordinary, I can do something - these feelings may be less, but for ages, crores of people get inspiration.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra took tribal students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam, a group of our tribal children to the highest peak in the world.
These Ashram-school students started training in August 2017 Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - they were trained.
These youths were selected under Mission Shaurya and they have made the country proud by conquering the verest of their names.
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur, my young friends and heartiest congratulations to them.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to conquer verest on behalf of Nepal
Many congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia verest became the first pair of Indian father-daughter to climb
Not only that young people are climbing the verest
Sangeeta Behl climbed the verest on May 19 and Sangeeta Behl is more than 50 years old
This work is not only commendable but also reflects their commitment towards cleanliness and environment.
Over the years, people have been climbing the verest and there are many who have successfully completed it.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to all these brave heroes, especially daughters.
people from every field in such a large number will come forward in its support
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more the country will play.
On social media, people are sharing the videos of Fitness Challenge, tagging each other and challenging them.
In Mann Ki Baat, many times you have heard from me about sportspersons, some things about sportspersons and the last time our heroes of Commonwealth Games were telling us through this programme - Namaskar sir
Image Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the sports that were once part of the life of every child, the streets and streets, are becoming less and less today.
These games were specially part of the summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that they were known by different names at different places, just as Pittu is now known by many names.
No one knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, Seven Stones, Dikori, Satodia
Traditional games have both kinds of games
There are out doors, even indoors.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known by different names at different places
I am from Gujarat, I know that there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal Isto
It ' s played with whips or tamarind seeds or dices and with 88 square boards
This game was played in almost every state .
We used to play these games
Who will be of us, who did not play gills in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game played from village to city .
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibari , in Maharashtra it is called Financial .
Some games have their own season
You must have seen that many children who are shy, but are very shy while playing.
From children to grandparents, grandparents and grandparents, whenever they play, they say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
At the same time, we also know our culture and traditions
Many sports also make us aware about society, environment etc.
By crowd sourcing we can make a huge archive of our traditional games
Videos of these games can be created, in which rules of sports can be shown about the way to play
On June 5, India will officially host World Environment Day.
This is a very important achievement for India and is an indication of Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change .
This time there is Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, understanding the spirit of this theme, its importance, all of us should ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature and on our health.
Go to World Environment Day website wide-india 2018 and all the suggestions are given in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to bring them into your everyday life.
In the last few weeks, we have seen that in different parts of the country there has been dust-half, heavy rains along with strong winds, which is unseasonal.
There was also loss of life, goods and losses
We have to live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this every step throughout his life
When India played a key role in the Op21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, it was at the core of this feeling of fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what we can do to make our planet clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You remember on 21st June, not only you, but the whole world remembers June 21.
21st June is observed as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparing months ago
News is being received these days, all over the world is preparing to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21.
Centuries ago, it means that on regular practice of Yoga some good qualities become like relatives and friends.
Yoga creates courage , which always protects us like a father .
A feeling of forgiveness arises as mother ' s for her children and mental peace becomes our lasting friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, mercy, our sister, self-confidence, our brother, the earth itself, our bed and knowledge becomes our hunger-free.
When so many qualities become companions , the Yogi wins over all kinds of fears .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to carry forward their legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May, the death anniversary of first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Panditji
The memory of this month is also related to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857, when Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers showed their bravery and stood up against injustice.
Sadly , for a long time , we have been calling the events of 1857 merely revolt or military revolt .
In fact , the incident was not only undermined but it was also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born the month in which the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of characteristics
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
How exactly did Atal ji depict
Savarkar went with both poetry and revolution
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a bold revolutionary
I was watching a story on television about our poor daughters from the raw settlements of Sikar in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who were once forced to take garbage from house to house, today they are sewing clothes to cover the poor by learning the work of sewing.
The daughters here, apart from their own clothes and their family, are sewing from normal to good clothes.
They are also facilitating skill development along with it.
Our daughters have become self-reliant today. They are living their lives with respect and have become a force for their families.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters with hope and confidence for their bright future.
They have shown that if you are determined to do something and if you are committed to it, success can be achieved even in all the difficulties. And this is not just about Sikar.
If you look around in the neighborhood then you will be able to see how people lose their problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some of the people.
These discussions are political, social, cinema, sports and sportspersons, and also on the problems of the country - the solution to these problems should be such - but often these things are confined to discussions only but there are some people who move forward in the direction of bringing about changes with their hard work and passion and make them a reality.
Something similar is the story of D. Prakash Rao, living in a slum in Cuttack city of Orissa to make others dream their own and to fulfil them.
Yesterday I got the privilege of meeting D. Prakash Rao
D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the past five decades
They make full arrangements for education, health and food to all children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and for giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have abolished the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the entire country.
Let ' s push forward the positiveness
In the month of June , there is so much heat that people wait for rain and look forward to the clouds in the sky .
A few days from now people will also wait for the moon
The observation of the moon means that the Eid can be celebrated .
During Ramadan , after one month ' s fast , the festival of Eid marks the beginning of celebration .
I am sure that everyone will celebrate the Eid with full fervor. Children will get specially good Idi on this occasion.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of goodwill in our society .
My best wishes to everyone
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
Once again in the next month ' s talk of mind ,
Talk of mind, April 2018
V.
Link it to India, let it lead India and I am glad that people are connecting with it with great enthusiasm. Many people have written to me showing their support for it, have sent letters, have also shared their fitness mantra on social media. A gentleman Mr. Shashikant Bhonsle has shared his picture of swimming pool - My weapon is my body, my element is water, My world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath writes, "With the morning walk, I feel myself happy and healthy and she further says - For me itnesses come with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy."
Make these holidays an opportunity to learn for a new experience My dear countrymen
When we hear that in the future there will be wars about water in the world , everyone talks about it , but do we have any responsibility
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
I dont know the Bengali language but when I was younger, I was used to getting up very quickly - from my childhood and in Eastern India the radio starts very soon and when it starts late in western India then I have a very fat feeling.
Rabindra Sangeet started at 30 o'clock in the morning, I didn't know the language, I didn't know the language, I got used to listening to Rabindra Sangeet by getting up early in the morning. And when Anandalok and Aguner, Poroshmoni got the opportunity to listen to these poems, the mind got a lot of consciousness. You too, Rabindra Sangeet and his poems must have influenced me.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, the land that shows the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, which has guided millions of people all over the world. This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the obligation of all of us to strive and walk on the path of Lord Buddha while remembering Lord Buddha.
Ambedkar insists that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy. He had said that my social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavmi
My best wishes to the countrymen on this holy festival of Ram Navami
We have seen the power of Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life .
Recently, on 26th January, when all the dignitaries from ASEAN countries were present here, they had come with them with multi-purpose troop and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting the Ramayana in front of us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are producing the same inspiration and influence not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of the world.
I once again convey my best wishes to you all for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, I have received all your letters, emails, phone calls and comments in large quantities this time too.
Soft Thakkar ji on MyGov - I read what you wrote about Sanskrit on-line courses.
Besides being a TV professional, it was a pleasure to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to reach out to you about the efforts being made on this side .
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit, I would also request them to consider how to carry forward the suggestions of Komal ji.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar read comments on your NarendraModiApp
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is definitely very important.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresh ji, I would like to talk to the youth about their health this time.
They think our youngsters are physically weak if they compare that in the Asian counters
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk to everyone about health in detail.
In the past, the President of France had visited Kashi. Shriman Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that visit were touching the mind and affecting it.
And, he had requested that all those photographs, all these videos should be publicized on social media.
Prashant ji, the government of India shared those photos on the same day on social media and Narendra ModiApp.
Angah, Jayesh, I want to inform all of you that your letters make me feel tired all day long.
So many letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I have read, I have heard and many of these things have touched my mind - even if I talk about them only then perhaps for months I will have to say something or the other.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about eam
Holidays are shared, your plan.
Worried about the water of animals and birds in the summer
Farmers brothers and sisters have received letters regarding the activities related to farmers and farming across the country.
Some active citizens of Water Conservation have sent suggestions
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions are discussed in the festival season.
That is, things of mind change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the things of our minds change the weather in somebody's life.
And why not change
It has the power to change the weather all over the country .
13 years ago, the sister of Saidul Laskar, ab-driver from Kolkata, died due to lack of timely treatment - decided to build a hospital so that no poor person dies due to lack of treatment.
In his mission, Saidul sold home ornaments and collected money through donations.
In this way, 12 years after collecting the money, the last attempt made by Saidul Laskar brought the color and today due to his hard work, due to his determination, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in the village of Punri near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, in the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, in every section, this belief has been awakened that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward
An atmosphere of self-confidence filled with hope and hope
This self-confidence, this positivity will fulfill our resolution of a New India, it will prove to be a dream.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
Be it Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri Ji or Lohia Ji or Chaudhary Charan Singh Ji or Chaudhary Devi Lal Ji, all have considered agriculture and farmers as an ego of the country's economy and common man's life.
This feeling is reflected in the line of Mahatma Gandhi's love for soil, farm, barn and farmer when he had said - "To forget the earth and take care of the soil, then it is a matter of forgetting ourselves"
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji often stressed on the need for conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had talked about better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and mass awareness for ensuring them and increasing food and milk production.
This low-sector state has done a great job
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record production during the year 2015-16 compared to the last five years.
They have shown that when the goal is set, the courage is elevated and there is a resolution in the mind then it can be proved by doing it.
In the letters I received, I was seeing that a lot of farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a major decision has been taken to provide the farmers with fair price for their crops.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times of their cost.
Attempts are being made to connect the local mandis of the village, the Holesale Market and the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go far to sell their produce - 22,000 rural haats in the country will be integrated with APM and e-NAM platforms while upgrading them with infrastructure.
In a way, connectivity is being made with any market in the country from the fields.
My dear countrymen, this year, the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi will begin.
How did the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is not only our resolution but also how can the 125 crore Indians pay the best tribute to Gandhi Ji by joining hands and shoulders
I urge you all to share your thoughts on this through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
What is slogan or mantra or proclamation
Please give your suggestions about this
Together we must pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him to take our country to new heights.
Tell us something about how the institutions are mobilising. Thank you, you have said it right and I believe that both Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat complement each other.
Today the country has moved beyond the conventional approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country where the responsibility of the Health Ministry was there earlier, now all the departments and ministries be it the Swachhta Ministry, the AYUSH Ministry, the Ministry of Hemispheres and Heritage, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on affordable health along with the preventive health.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we become aware of the preventive healthcare, the more the individual, the family and the society will benefit.
Life is the first requirement for being healthy - cleanliness
As a preventive healthcare, Yoga has made its mark in the world in a new way.
Yoga guarantees both fitness and wellness
This is the result of our commitment that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
International Yoga Day this time is less than 100 days left between 21st June
On the last three International Yoga Days, people participated in it with great enthusiasm everywhere in the country and around the world
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, all, Yoga right now.
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
I will share this video with all of you so that we can practice asana, pranayama together.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level to make healthcare accessible and affordable for the common man.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being made available at affordable prices.
More new centers are being opened
My appeal to the audience of Mann Ki Baat is to provide information to the needy people about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras.
They will have a great service .
Price of heart stent has been reduced to 85 for cardiovascular diseases

Aims to make the country TB free by 2025
It ' s a big job .
You need help in awakening the masses
We all have to make collective efforts to get rid of TB
My dear countrymen, 14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had spoken of industrialization of India.
For them, the industry was an effective medium in which the poorest of the poor could be provided employment.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the world's largest Foreign Direct Investment has emerged.
The whole world is looking at India as the FB for investment innovation and development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible only in the cities due to which Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar relied on the urbanization and urbanization of India.
Moving ahead of his vision, smart cities missions and urban missions were launched in the country so that every kind of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country - be it good roads, water supply, healthcare, education or digital connectivity can be provided.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
They didn ' t want a person to always live in poverty .
At the same time, he also believed that merely distributing something to the poor could not remove their poverty.
India, Stand up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
In the 1930s and 1940s, when there was talk of roads and railways only in India, Baba Saheb Ambedkar talked about ports and waterways.
It was Dr. Baba Saheb who saw hydropower as a nation-power
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on different sea shores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 40s, most of the discussions were about 2nd World War, emerging World War and Partition. At that time, Dr.
He had laid the foundation of India's spirit
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working closely with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance. And most importantly, Dr.
They have shown us that it is not necessary that we are born in a big or wealthy family, but those born in poor families in India can also dream, try to fulfil those dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people made fun of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
India belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward.
Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan being organized from 14th April to 5th May to mark the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar
Under this, there will be separate programmes on Gram-Development, Poor-Welfare and Social Justice across India.
I urge you all to take part in this campaign in a big way.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days, many festivals are going to be held, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Eastern Vaisakhi
Day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance
The life and vision of the messenger of non-violence, Lord Mahavir ji will inspire all of us
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the Easter is discussed, the inspiring teachings of Lord Jesus Christ are remembered, who have always given humanity a message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India. In the same days, the twins and satvions in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will have a joy and joy.
All these festivals are somehow connected with our fields, fields and granaries. Through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts that we receive in the form of yields.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat begins today with a phone call.
We have seen that the color of the sea appears blue but we know from our daily life experiences that water has no colour .
Have we ever imagined that the river, the sea, why the water becomes colourful
The same question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India
When we talk of science, first of all, the name of Indo-Ratna Sir C. V.
One of his dinners is known as Raman Defect .
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year because it is said that on this day he had hosted the event of light scattering for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta. On the other hand, Sushruta and Charaka are our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, Hamous Particle Boson was also named after him.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles happening in the field of science.
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smart with self learning.
Can farmers help with crop yield
In the past, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel for the inauguration of the ICDRATE in Ahmedabad.
Science and Technology are value-neutral
They don't have values, themselves
Any machine will do the same thing as we want .
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dison , who invented Wight Bulb , failed many times in his experiments
Once he was asked about this, he replied that I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making the High Bulb, that is, Dison has made his failures his strength.
Fortunately, today I am in Auroville, the workplace of Maharshi Arabic.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
Find answers and show the path to humanity
The feeling of repeated questions to know the truth is important
That ' s the real motivation behind the scientific dinner
Should not sit comfortably until questions like why, what and how can not be answered
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, During the Crisis time, a lot of messages come to me on these topics safety and disaster, people keep writing to me something or the other.
From Pune, Shriman Ravindra Singh has spoken on occupational safety in his comment on NarendraModi Mobile App.
He has written that safety standards are not so good on factories and construction sites in our country.
If India has a National Safety Day on March 4, then the Prime Minister should talk about safety in his Mann Ki Baat program so that awareness about safety increases among the people.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, we are not able to achieve it then it becomes difficult to achieve it during disasters.
All of us read the board written on the roads several times, it says that vigilance has diminished, one forgets, one forgets, one smiles, happiness and smile - do not leave the world so quickly, do not connect with security - no fun, otherwise it will be cheaper than that sentence is sometimes used in our life.
If we remain cautious, follow the requisite rules, we can save our lives, but we can also save our society from major accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of threads have been written about safety on the work place but when we look at it, we dont see its observance.
As far as disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity from the point of view of geographical and climate.
This country has witnessed many natural and man-made disasters, such as chemical and industrial accidents.
Initiatives called Disaster Mitra have also been taken for training of volunteers in flood-related areas.
Training and awareness have a very important role
Two-three years ago thousands of people lost their lives every year from the Lou Heat Wave.
Subsequently, NMA organised workshops for management of Heat Wave, launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
A good result came out of everyone's participation
Number of deaths due to Lu in 2017 decreased unexpectedly to around 220
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get security
I would like to appreciate the innumerable people, social organizations, aware citizens who are engaged in relief and rescue operations within minutes of disaster anywhere.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscience society
In our culture, we often talk about values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of safety.
We have to make it a part of our lives
I mean, what was the information system
Why
Because we are not naturally conscious and therefore we listen after sitting in our ears and aeroplanes but none of us thinks that this information is for me.
We have the same experience in every sphere of life
We should not think that safety is for someone else, if we all become conscious of our safety then the spirit of safety of the society is also inherent.
My dear countrymen, this time the budget emphasized on making villages waste to wealth and waste to energy through biogas under Swachh Bharat.
Initiatives were initiated for this and it was named GBAR-Chan - Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-Chan scheme is to clean the villages and generate wealth and energy from them by converting solid waste from animal dung and farm waste into MPST and BI-GAS.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other biological waste to produce energy but in India its full potential was not being utilized .
Under Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are now moving in this direction
The goal of making use of cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, biogas based energy has been set.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to look at dung and waste not just as waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-sufficiency in energy for cooking and lighting
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing the income
New job opportunities will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
A online trading platform will also be created for the smooth functioning of the Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers get the right price for dung and agriculture waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self help groups and cooperative societies.
I invite you to become partners in this movement of clean energy and green jobs. Initiate towards converting waste into wealth in your village and making dung-dhan with dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been listening to several kinds of festivals such as music festivals, food festivals, film festivals etc.
But in a unique attempt at Raipur in Chhattisgarh, the first waste festival of the state was organized.
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness and create awareness about the various ways of re-use of the city's waste.
There was a variety of activity during this festival in which everyone from students to adults participated.
Different types of artifacts were made using garbage .
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of Waste Management
Inspired by Raipur, different types of garbage festivals took place in other districts too.
Everyone initiated their own initiatives and shared innovative ideas, discussions and poetry about cleanliness.
A festive atmosphere was created about cleanliness
The way schoolchildren took part in it, it was amazing
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and sanitation was displayed in this festival.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year
There are many programmes in the country and the world
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country also felicitates those women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past.
On this occasion I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda .
He had said that the idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence - this idea of Swami ji a hundred and fifty years ago expresses the contemplation of women power in Indian culture.
It is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life. It is our responsibility.
We are a part of that tradition where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-son, this was the identity of a son.
They have not only carried forward themselves but have also carried forward the country and the society and have taken it to a new level.
In the past , a very good suggestion was given to me by a gentleman
He had suggested that on 8th March, there are similar programmes to commemorate Women's Day. Does every village and city have completed 100 years
Can a programme of respecting such mothers and sisters be organized and a long life can be talked about in it
Starting from 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new paradigm by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water bodies, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women's masons
You can imagine how big the event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has such a power that will effectively transform the Swachhta Abhiyan, Sanskrit Sanskrit into the habit of the common man in general.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You all are well aware, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being with Mumbai and having such a big tourist destination, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years after independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sentbandar, the darkness that was there in the lives of the people, now that darkness is sixth and their life has become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am glad that the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will now be lighted by electricity
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning in the era of development.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness for the countrymen if their lives are illuminated
My dear brothers and sisters, We just celebrated the Shivratri festival.
Now in the month of March, the farms decorated with shallow crops, golden earrings of orange wheat and adornment of mangoes that entice the mind - this is the unique feature of this month.
But this month is also very dear to all of us for Holi festivals .
On March 2, the entire country will celebrate Holi with joy
The importance of Holi is equally important for Holika combustion , because this day is a day to burn evils in fire and destroy them .
Holi is an auspicious opportunity to be a part of each other's happiness and happiness by forgetting all the differences and differences. And love gives a message of unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Holi.
This festival is full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - this is the best wishes
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, today I have written a long letter on NarendraModiApp and have urged me to touch upon the topics written in his letter.
He has written, the date of the virtue of Kalpana Chawla, which goes to space on February 1.
She left us in the Columbia spacecraft accident , but inspired millions of young people all over the world .
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter with the departure of Kalpana Chawla.
It is sad for everyone that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, especially to India that there is no limit to women power.
It is impossible if there is a desire and determination, if there is a duty to do something.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that today women in India are moving fast in every field and are enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect for women in our country, their place in the society and their contribution has surprised the whole world.
Indian scientists have a long tradition
Many of Indias scholars have contributed to the building of the Vedas
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi do not know many names
It reflects the importance of women in our society
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of power
This woman power binds the entire nation, the entire society, the family, the unity of the country.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples
He has written that our bold defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft will fly in Sukhoi 30, inspire them
Three brave women Bhavn Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi fighter pilots have been constructed and are undergoing training at Sukhoi-30.
Capacity Vajpayee-led All Women Crue, from Delhi to San Francisco and from Delhi to Air India.
India Boeing flew to Jet - and all the women
Honble President of India took a new initiative in the past
The President met a group of extraordinary women who had done something first in their respective fields.
These women achievers of the country, First Demale Merchant Navy Aptain, First Lady of Passenger Train Train Train Train, First Lady Fire Fighter, First Lady Bus River, first lady to reach Antarctica, first lady to reach Everest, in this way, First Ladies and Gentlemen in every field have achieved extraordinary achievements breaking the conservatives of the society and established a record.
He showed that a new path can be created by crossing all obstacles and obstacles through hard work, perseverance and determination.
A book on these women achievers, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire country can take inspiration from the knowledge, life and work of these women.
This is also available as e-book on NarendraModi website
Today, the women power of the country plays an important role in the positive transformation in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you must be wondering what is the connection between this.
Mumbai ' s Matunga station is the first station in India to have all women employees
Whether it is Commercial Export, Railway Police, Ticket Hecking, Announcing, Point Person, more than 40 women have a status in all the departments.
This time, after seeing the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and on the other social media that one of the key points of the parade was the BSF Biker Contingent in which all the women were participating.
They were doing bold experiments and this scene was also surprised by the guests coming from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance
Today, our women power is leading
Being self-reliant
When the mention comes to the notice of tribal women, a definite picture emerges in everyone's mind, in which there are jungles, footpaths, women carrying the burden of wood on them.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected region
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
Tribal women in such dangerous areas are becoming self-reliant by running - Rickshaw
In a very short span of time , many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration here, from providing grants to training, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Abandoning the time-out, accepting the correction of what is necessary
Any life-society is identified by Self-Forecting Mechanism.
Contrary to social evils and evils, our country has been steadily striving individually and socially for centuries.
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
To eradicate social evils in the state, the worlds longest human chain of more than 13,000 kilometers has been created.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of evils like child marriage and dowry
The entire state resolved to fight against evils like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters were all involved in this war.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the human chain continues to unbreakablely connect the borders of the State
It is important that our society is free from these evils so that all the people of the society can truly benefit from development .
Let us collectively take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and take a new dimension.
Make India a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain that he has taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov that on the advice of his father, the cost of medicines used to be Rs.
He did not know about the first Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana
But now when they got information about the Janaushadhi Kendra and they purchased medicines from there, their cost of medicines reduced by 75 percent.
He has expressed his desire to talk about it in a programme of mind so that more and more people can know about it and take advantage of it.
For the past few years, many people used to write and tell me about this.
Get a deep satisfaction
And I was also very happy that Shriman Darshan ji came to know that the ideas he had received were also received by others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make Health Care affordable and encourage Case of Living
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50-90 with branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines every day, a lot of savings.
The generic medicines to be purchased are according to the standards set for World Health Organization .
That ' s why good quality medicines are available at cheaper prices .
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This is not only providing affordable medicines but also generating new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Amrit Stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals
The only purpose behind all these is to provide quality and affordable health services to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a Photo on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
It was Photo that pulled my attention to that Photo
The photo was such that a grandson was taking part in the Clean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness drive to clean the Morana river under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morana river flows for twelve months before but now it is seasonal
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, jalkumbh
A lot of waste was being thrown at the river and its banks .
A action plan was prepared and on 13th January a day before Makar Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Lean Morna, two edges of Morana river were cleaned at fourteen places in the area of four kilometers.
In this noble work of Mission Lean Morna, more than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, colleges, students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters, everyone participated in it.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was continued on 20th January, 2018 and I have been told that this campaign will take place every Saturday morning unless the Morana river is completely cleaned.
It shows that nothing is impossible if a person decides to do something .
Major changes can be brought about through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and municipal administration for making this work a mass movement and I congratulate all the citizens and your efforts and your efforts will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about the Padma Awards these days.
Even in newspapers, this topic attracts attention to T..
Every year there has been a tradition of giving Padma awards but in the last three years its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone
Transparency has come due to the entire process being online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has become a complete transformation.
Padma Awards have been given to such people who are not usually seen in big cities, newspapers, TVs, festivals.
Now the importance of his work is increasing, not the identity of the person for the award
You must have heard that Mr. Arvind Gupta ji will be happy to know you.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life in making toys for children.
They have been making toys from waste for four decades to enhance the curiosity of science in children
Their effort is to inspire children from useless things to scientific experiments, for this, they are motivating children by showing films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication
Similar story is the story of Sitava Joddi (SI) of Karnataka.
They have not been called the Goddess of Women's Empowerment
For the last three decades , in Belagavi , he has contributed greatly in changing the lives of countless women .
He had dedicated himself as Devadasi at the age of seven but then spent his entire life for the welfare of Devadasis .
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family and tribal family.
He used to do ordinary jobs for living but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings.
Today, due to this hobby, they are respected not only in India but in the whole world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji who illuminated Indias name abroad was recognized and awarded the Padma Shri award
You will be happy to hear the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a cottage made of palm leaves in the tribal area between dense forests.
He created five hundred herbal medicines on his memory
He has the expertise in manufacturing medicines used after cutting snakes .
Lakshmi Ji is constantly serving the society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
Recognizing this anonymous personality , he was awarded the Padma Shri for his contribution to society .
I would like to mention another name today : 75 - year - old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was also chosen for the award .
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in others' homes to build a hospital
When she was 23 years old , her husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor .
Today, thousands of poor people are treated freely in their hard worked hospitals.
I am sure that our Bahuratna-Vasundhara has many such males, there are many females whom no one knows, no one knows or knows.
The Padma Awards are a medium but I would like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who have been living around us for the society, who have been living around us for the society, who have been consuming some specialty and have been working throughout their lives. Sometimes they should be brought into the middle of the society.
They do not work for dignity but their work inspires us
Sometimes people in schools, colleges should call upon and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there should be some effort in the society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
This is the 9th of January, when revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARIA
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we had organized a programme where all MPs and Mayors of Indian Origin living across the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in that programme from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Diji, Tania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, and from many other countries wherever our mayor is there, Indians, where MPs are original Indians, all of them participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries but also maintaining strong relations with India. This time the European Union, the European Union has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions to various fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe in a very good manner.
Somebody is dedicated to Ayurveda, somebody brings the minds of the society through his music and somebody through his poems.
Someone is doing research on climate change and someone is working on Indian texts. Someone has set up a gurudwara by driving a truck and someone has built a mosque.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for recognising the people of Indian origin and for giving information to people around the world through them.
On 30th January, the holy guest of revered Bapu who has shown us a new path
On that day we celebrate Martyrs Day, we pay tributes at 11 o'clock to the great martyrs who laid down their lives in the defense of the country.
The path of peace and non-violence, this is Bapu's path
Whether it is India or the world, be it individuals, family or socially revered Bapu Ji, the ideals and ideals that Bapu has taught us are extremely relevant even today.
They weren ' t just blank principles
At present, we see on Dagar-Dagar how right Bapu's things were
What can be a big tribute to Bapu if we resolve to walk on the path of Bapu as much as possible
My dear countrymen, I conclude by conveying my best wishes to you all for 2018.
Where the youth of 18 to 25 years of age should sit together and churn on a New India, find ways and plans
How can we prove our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India dreamt of by our freedom fighters
B.
a.
I talked to them, there was no mention of despair, there was excitement, enthusiasm, energy, dreams, I had resolved that the time I spent with those daughters, I also got inspiration and this is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country, not only of our country but whenever there is talk of the famous religious places of the world, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
And especially in that place which is situated between hills and forests, how can this problem be converted into a ritual, how can we find a way to overcome the problem and what is the strength of public participation - this is in itself an example of Sabarimala Temple.
Who will make such rules
It is hardly possible that there will be a citizen of India who does not respect them, who does not respect them.
At that age, we are bigger than all of us, and they are witnesses to different stages of the country.
She is getting 90 years old on September 28
Before my departure abroad, I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone.
These conversations were the same, like, in very far, younger brother, he talks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I thought, Hilata ji: Hamodi ji: My best wishes to you on birthday, let me congratulate you on advance
Lata ji: There are many people bigger than the age but it is a big thing to get the blessings of something bigger than your work.
Lata ji: Yes, I think my parents have blessings, and the blessings of those who listen.
I'm nothing
Modi ji: Yes, this is your humility, this is a great education for all of us, it is an inspiration for us that you have always given priority to the values and humility of your parents even after learning all this in your life.
Lata ji:
Modi ji: And whenever I come to you ji: G Modi ji: You have fed me something or the other Gujarati
Lata ji: You do not know yourself what you are
I know that your visit is changing the picture of India and I am very happy that.
Looks very nice
Modi ji: Just keep on showering your blessings, your blessings remain on the whole country. And you have always inspired me to see people like us do something good.
I keep getting your letters and I keep getting some of your gifts and gifts. I enjoy a special joy of this pattern, which is a family relationship.
Lata ji: ji, ji
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble, because, I see, I know how busy you are and how much work you do.
What do you have to think
Whenever you visited your mother to touch her feet, I also sent someone to see him and took his blessings.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And when she blessed me on the telephone, I felt very good, Modi ji: Our mother was very happy because of your love.
And once again I convey my best wishes to you on your birthday.
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, he used to think that Rubru would come to Jayalta ji: Yes, yes
Lata ji: Yes, surely, surely
This is my fortune
Modi ji: Pranam, Didi
Lata ji: Pranam
Modi ji: My best wishes to you ji: Very greetings
Modi ji: Pranam ji
For several weeks, across the country, there will be a thrill of festivals.
My best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals
Festivals, all family members will come together
Perhaps, these sayings are not just words, we have an order, a philosophy, an inspiration
Just imagine, on the one hand, some houses shine with light, on the other hand, in front of them, in the houses of some people around them, there is darkness.
In some houses, sweets are getting worse, so in some houses, children crave sweets.
The real pleasure of these festivals is only when it is dark sixth, it is dark - light spreads
We share happiness, where there is lack, and, this is also our nature.
Think about the delivery out of our homes, of sweets, of clothing, of gits, when delivery is in.
At least in our homes, which is in excess, which we dont use now, we must deliberately out of such things.
In many cities, the start-ups of several NGOs and young colleagues are doing this thing.
They collect clothes, sweets, food, everything from the houses of the people, they bring the needy, they provide them with anonymous activity.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, eradicate darkness under this lamp
Your smiles on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness, your faces will glow, your smiles will become lighter, your Diwali will become lighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, in the form of good fortune and prosperity, Lakshmi's house comes home.
In our culture, daughters are considered Lakshmi because daughters bring good fortune and prosperity
Can we do the program of honoring this Lakshmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters around us, many of them who will be doing extraordinary work.
And if someone is engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health then someone will be serving the society by becoming a doctor and an engineer.
By becoming a lawyer, you must try to get justice for someone
Our society should identify such daughters, respect them and take pride in them
Their respect programs, be all over the country
One more thing, that, about the achievements of these daughters, share maximum in social media, and use bharatkilami (India's Lakshmi)
Just like we all had carried out a grand campaign, Selfie with Daughter and it had spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, we run the campaign, India's Lakshmi
Promotion of India's Lakshmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen
My dear countrymen, I had said this thing about Mann Ki Baat earlier too. It is a great advantage that I get the good fortune of communicating directly and indirectly with a lot of ignorant people.
In the past, a student from remote Arunachal has sent me a big interesting letter to Alina Tayang.
And it says, I read the letter before you. Hon'ble Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tayang
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when my exam results came, some people asked me if you read the Fam Warriors book
I told you, I haven't read this book
But, going back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
After that my experience was very good .
I thought, if I had read this book before Heam, I would have had a lot of benefits.
I liked many aspects from this book, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing the letter.
Fam Warriors 2-3 times to read, thank you
You have said that if I get out during the new edition, I will definitely try to write some things for the parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share your experiences and suggestions on the aspects related to stress free exams.
I ' m going to study it .
I will think about it and I will try to write whatever I feel right out of it in my own words, in my own way, and it may happen that if your suggestions come more then my new education will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend, student Alina Tayang of Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India through newspapers and TV.
But, you know, I'm a normal person like you.
If there was someone else on this occasion, he would have been sad and disappointed, but, not his face, but he brought a smile on everyone's face with his words.
In his humility, simplicity and true sense, everybody was convinced that the form of sportsman spirit was found in letter and spirit.
The audience present there warmly welcomed his words
Even after losing in a tough fight , he praised his rival Nadal and gave the living evidence of the sportsman spirit .
On the other hand, however, Champion Nadal also fervently applauded Wanifil's game.
The passion of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner were both worth seeing .
The thinking of our ancestors is truly worthwhile
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janjati Loksya Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when a person embraces merit and humility, then who can not win his heart
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people around the world
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to talk about now, I am doing it straightforward for your good.
it ' s very hard to stop it later .
But, if we stop him from awakening in the beginning, a lot can be saved
With this feeling, I feel like talking to my youth, especially today.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health, and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to the people who consume tobacco.
Everyone says so .
Tobacco intoxication is due to nicotine present in it .
By its consumption in adolescence development of brain also gets affected .
But, today, I want to talk to you, a new subject
You must be aware that recently there has been a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic device different from the normal cigarette.
While we understand the dangers of common cigarettes well, a misconception about e-cigarette has been created.
This error has been spread that there is no danger from e-cigarette.
It is their endeavor, that no family member should smoke, smoke.
They know that smoking, tobacco causes heavy losses to the body.
The drinker knows and the seer knows .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different.
There is not so much awareness among the people about e-cigarettes.
They are completely unaware of its dangers and for this reason sometimes e-cigarettes secretly enter the house in curiosity.
Our youth walks on the path of waste and walks unknowingly
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarettes, which have a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it from the smell
In such a scenario, many adolescents and youngsters, ignorantly and sometimes proudly walk in the midst of their books, in their offices, in their pockets, in their own hands and sometimes they become victims of it.
The younger generation is the future of the country
e-cigarette has been banned so that this new method of intoxication does not destroy our young country.
Do not trample the dreams of every family, the lives of children will not be wasted
These diseases, these habits do not root in the society
I urge you all to abandon the addiction of tobacco and do not make any misunderstandings regarding e-cigarette.
Let us together build a healthy India
You have an IT ID.
Remember India, right
India means a little here that if we go to gym for two hours in the morning and evening then it will happen.
This is our Mother India, this is our country, the multi-storeyed Vasundhara
Many human gems have emerged from this earth
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been a land of action.
And these are the people who have spent their lives, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great Vibhuti is being honored in Vatican City on October 13
It is a matter of pride for every Indian, that Pope Francis will declare Mary Thresia as a saint on October 13
The work done by Sister Mary Thresia for the betterment of humanity in the short life of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
He had a wonderful attachment to social service and education.
He built several schools, hostels and orphanages, and spent his life in this mission.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world. Today, when we are celebrating 150, 130 crore Indians have pledged to be free from Single Sea Plastic.
In the direction of environmental protection, the kind of leadership that India has taken in the entire world, today the vision of all the countries is moving towards India.
I am sure that all of you will be going to be part of the campaign to get rid of Single Sea Plastic on October 2.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way.
But, a young man from our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
When I noticed his work, I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand his new experiment.
Perhaps these things could help the people of the country.
Mr. Rippudman Belvi ji is making a unique effort they do plogging
When I first heard the word plogging, it was new to me.
Overseas , perhaps , these words have been used in some quantities
But, in India, Ripudman Belvi ji has propagated this thing very much.
Let ' s talk to them
Friends, This time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports has also taken the lead.
2 km plogging on 2nd October, these programmes are going to be held across the country.
We have heard from the experience of Ripudman ji how this programme should be done, what happens in the programme.
With this , We shall not only take care of ourselves , but We shall be able to guard ourselves from the earth .
With this campaign, awareness is increasing among the people about cleanliness as well as cleanliness.
I am confident that if 130 crore countrymen take one step in this direction, then India will move 130 crore steps ahead in the direction of getting rid of single use plastic.
Ripudman ji, once again, thank you very much
And I congratulate you, your team, and for this new imagination.
Want to move forward to transform your life into a country
One thing you want to remember in advance
However, in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will say that in detail, but today I am asking you in advance so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
So you start preparing now .
I will definitely talk about it in detail but now it is time, some people can start practise and some can plan.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places in India.
At least 15 places and if that happens then make one night, two night stop programmes.
You see, understand, experience India
How many diversities do we have
And when these festivals of Diwali come on holidays, people go and I will urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
Today our rank is thirty-four and five years ago our rank was at the 65th position i. e.
If we try more then by the time we will complete 75 years of our independence, we will make our place in the top positions of the world in tourism.
You must see that there is a fire in the days of Diwali, firecrackers and firecrackers.
Whatever objection you should take for this , you must take it .
Let's go
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Can you imagine how hard he had worked for the constitution of his country full of diversity
The Konkan coastline, where the sea plays an important role, under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj, many forts like Sindhu Fort, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either situated on the beaches or were either surrounding the sea. The Maratha Navy was responsible for the security of these forts. Maratha Navy had combination of large ships and small boats in Maratha Navy, their naval personnel were extremely skilled in attacking and defending any enemy and we should discuss the Maratha Navy and do not remember Kanhoji Angra.
Thinking that there will be no soil, no trees and plants will grow, where will it be possible for human life
Where will the organism be possible
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific methods that Earth and Mother cause serious damage due to excessive use of urea, how can a farmer be the son of the earth, how can he see the mother Earth sick
The need of the hour is whether our farmers, the sons of our soil and the children of our soil can make a solemn pledge to revive the relationship of this mother-son once again whether they will stop using the amount of urea they use today in their fields by 2022, when it will be 75 years of independence.
The person of North-India will not know what is in South India
The person of West-India will not know what is in East-India
Our country is full of diversity, Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, if you look at him then it comes to know that when he deviated from India then he got a new inspiration to see India and to die for him, all these great men made extensive visits to India. At the beginning of their work, they tried to understand and understand India in themselves. Can we try to learn and understand the different states of our country, different societies, their customs, their traditions, their cattle, their food habits and their beliefs as a student
Can you keep Incredible India (hash tag incredibleindia) on
You see, if all the people of a state will say this thing then I will ask the government to scrutinize it and prepare the publicity collaboration on the seven things that have come from every state. In a way, how should the tourist destination be promoted with the intentions of the people
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand, when news of violence comes from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry.
This is our country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the country of Sardar Patel who gave life to the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have accepted public life, values, non-violence and respect.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening since childhood, say
I want to assure the countrymen, the law takers, those who suppress the path of violence, be it individuals or groups, these countries will never tolerate or tolerate any government.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life
Even our festivals are full of diversity and because of our cultural heritage thousands of years old, see cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals go according to the leaflet during nature.
There is a direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly related to the farmers and are associated with the fishermen.
Today I am talking about festivals and first of all I would like to call you Michami Dukkadam
Yesterday, the festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated in Jain society
In Jain society , festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra .
The last day of the festival is the Sanvatsari day .
It ' s really a wonderful tradition in itself .
The festival of Samvatsari symbolizes forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
In a way, it is also called the festival of forgiveness and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other 'Michami Dukkadam'.
Anyway, in our scriptures, forgiveness is a blessing of Virasya Bhushan.
Forgiving is a hero .
And Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person.
Shakespeare wrote in his drama The Merchant of Defense the importance of forgiveness, Mercy is two blessed, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes the meaning of forgiveness and who is forgiven, both receive the blessings of God
My dear countrymen, these days Ganesh Chaturthi is spread every corner of the country and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to talk about Ganesh Chaturthi.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and he became a symbol of the freedom movement before 125 years of independence.
And after independence, they have become symbols of social education, social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasts for 10 days
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity
My best wishes to all the countrymen for Ganesh Festival
Onam Festival is being celebrated in Kerala
One of Indias colourful festivals, Onam is a major festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
Onam Festival showcases Keralas rich cultural heritage
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in the society as well as a new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming the reason for tourism.
And I would like to tell my countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the festival of Durga in Bengal, in a way the festival of tourism has become an attraction.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What we can do in that direction, we should think
A few days later, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country in the series of these festivals.
Many congratulations and best wishes to all the countrymen on Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and belief for us but we also have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and sanitation are associated with family life
Preparation of the festival means cleanliness
This is not something new for us , but it is also necessary to create a social habit .
The public urge for cleanliness should not only be at home but also be an integral part of cleanliness in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new parameter, how traditional you are, how modern you are, how modern your thought-processing is, a scale has started to work in knowing all this and how conscious you are towards the environment.
Eco-friendly, environment-friendly behavior in your own activities is against that
In society , if it is against it , it is considered evil today .
And today I can see the result of this thing that in this festival of Ganeshotsav, eco-friendly Ganapati, as if a big campaign has been started.
If you go to YouTube and see that in every household the children are making Ganesh ji, they are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Various experiments are being done in every family
See how big a change has taken place and this is a pleasant change .
And as I said, our country is full of crores of stunning minds.
Three years ago, when Swachhata campaign was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
And, her positive results are visible
Coverage of toilets has reached about 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
In the past, there was a severe flood in Gujarat
A lot of people lost their lives but after the flood , when the water was reduced , so much dirt was lost everywhere .
At such a time, the workers of Jamiat Ulemayehind, in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat, cleaned 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
Shed the sweat of herself, everyone went out
Excellent example of unity for cleanliness, such an example inspiring everyone, given by all the workers of Jamiat Ulemay Hind
A dedicated effort towards cleanliness, if it becomes our permanent nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again on 2nd October, 15-20 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, Swachhata Hi Seva had been said to be a service to the people.
Create an environment for cleanliness across the country
As we get the opportunity, wherever we get the opportunity, we find opportunities
But we all get connected
Assume this as a preparation for Diwali, accept it as a preparation for Navratri in a way, assume preparation for Durga Puja
My friends of social media can run some constructive campaigns and can inspire Virtual World to work on the ground.
Swachh Sankalp Se Swachh Siddhi Contest, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation organises this campaign in which you are contesting essays, short film making competition, painting competition
In this, you can write essays in different languages and there is no age limit, no age limit.
You can make short films, make it from your mobile
Can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness
They can be in any language, they can be silent.
You see, this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine
You can imagine, after this 15-day cleanliness drive, after the Swachhata Hi Seva, on 2nd October, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, it will be a sacred joy to pay homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I want to accept the loan of all of you in a special way today.
I want to express my gratitude to you from the depths of my heart, not because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for so long. I want to express my gratitude because millions of people from every corner of the country join this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of people listening to me is in crores but millions of people write to me sometimes letters, sometimes messages and sometimes messages are received on the phone, I have a huge treasure.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I ' m more waiting for your message than you ' re waiting for .
I ' m tempted because you get to learn something from everything
You might think yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake
Sometimes some things become such a part of our habit that we do not think we are wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking Aparna from Poona
I want to tell you about one of my friends
She always tries to help people , but I ' m surprised to see one of her habits
I once went to the shopping mall with her
He spent two thousand rupees very comfortably on a sari and Rs. 450 on a pizza, while the auto that he had taken to the mall was negotiating for five rupees from that auto driver for a long time.
Returning on the way, purchased vegetables and saved 4-5 rupees by bargaining on every vegetable
I feel very bad
You must talk about it in your mind .
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you might have been surprised, alerted and maybe you might have decided not to make such a mistake in the future.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, whenever a ferry person comes to our house, whenever we talk to a small shopkeeper or a vegetable seller, whenever we talk to an auto rickshaw driver then we start negotiating with him and we start negotiating with him.
And when we go to a big restaurant to eat food, we don't even see what is written in the bill.
Not only this, they should buy saris in the showroom, they dont have any bargaining, but they dont live without negotiating for a poor person.
Have you ever thought of what would happen to the poor mind
Rupees five do not make any difference in your life but have you ever imagined that this small habit of yours would have pushed him deeply
Madam, I am grateful to you. You gave me a message by calling me a heart-touching phone.
I am sure that my countrymen will be used to doing this to the poor , so they will surely give up .
My dear young friends, on 29th August the entire country celebrates as National Sports Day
This is the birthday of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey was incomparable
I am reminded of the fact that I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports
Games become part of our lives
If we are a young country in the world , we should also look at this young playground .
Sports i.e. physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement I understand what more is required
The game is in a way a very big herb of heart reconciliation .
The young generation of our country came forward in the field of sports and today in the era of computer, I would like to warn that playing field is more important than play-station.
Play A , but play outside in the field too , and sometimes act with Hootball .
Cricket plays on the computer but the joy of playing cricket under the sky in the open ground is something else.
There was a time when the kids of the family used to go out and the mother asked earlier when you would come back .
Today the condition is that as soon as the children come home, they either get to see cartoon ilms or get stuck on mobile games and then they have to scream and say to their mother when you will go out.
It is a matter of great pleasure for our youth that the IAF Under 17 World Cup is going to be held in India from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from around the world are going to make India their home
Let our youngsters coming from all over the world welcome guests, sports enthusiasts and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share a very touching incident with the countrymen last week.
I had the opportunity to meet some young daughters and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Will ever spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will spend in water
With courage among the waves of the sea, these six daughters and this is the first incident in the world.
Who will be Hindustani who do not describe our daughters
I salute the strength of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModiApp so that you must read it because in a way this is a story of courage, a story of self-respect and I will be glad to bring these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters and blessings.
My dear countrymen, we all celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
It is the birthday of Dr. Radhakrishnan ji, the former President of our country
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I bow down to him, the great scientist, Albert Einstein, had said.
It is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to awaken job in creative expression and knowledge. It is the most important quality of a teacher to enjoy creative emotions and knowledge in his students.
This time , when we celebrate Teachers ' Day , can we all make a resolve together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we make collective efforts then we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Let's take the mantra of technology to transform
Salute Prime Minister
My name is Dr. Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Howard University.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana financial inclusion has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also in the entire world about the pundits of the economic world.
On August 28, 2014, this campaign was started with a dream in mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Campaign will be held for three years tomorrow on 28th August
30 crore new families have been connected with it, bank accounts have been opened.
It ' s more than the population of many countries in the world
Today, I have a very big solution that within three years, my poor brothers and sisters who are sitting at the last corner of the society have become a part of the country's economy, their habits have changed, they have started coming and going to bank, they have started saving money, they are feeling the security of money.
Sometimes money stays in hand, sometimes in a pocket, sometimes in a house, sometimes it feels like spending a lot of money.
Money will work if you want to do something good in the coming days
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks through our poor people.
In a way, this is the savings of the poor. This is his strength in the coming days.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the accounts of which have been opened, have also been benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, a very simple premium of Rs.
In many families, due to the insurance of one rupee, when a crisis arose on the poor man, the life of the head of the family ended, in a few days he got Rs. 2 lakhs.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, be it Dalits or Tribals or be it a youth who is educated or educated or be it a youth who is determined to do something on his own feet, millions of youngsters have been able to get guaranteed money from the banks without any guarantee from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Today is not so much time but I would definitely like to tell the people of Bank that they should upload it on MyGov. in. People will get inspired from it that how a scheme brings transformation in the life of a person, how it fills new energy, how it fills new faith and how hundreds of examples of this thing have come to me.
I will make every effort to reach you and there is such an inspiring incident that people of media can take full advantage of it.
They can also inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
Man's mind is such that rainy season is a very charming period for mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature everybody enjoys the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a formidable form, it shows how powerful it is to destroy the water.
Nature keeps us alive but sometimes natural calamities like floods and earthquakes destroy us very badly.
The changes that are taking place in the changing weather cycle and the environment are also being negatively impacted.
Over the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal, have suffered a natural calamity due to excessive rainfall.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief work is being done at a broad level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues from the Council of Ministers are also reaching.
State governments are also making every effort to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and civil servants are also making every effort to help the people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, be it the soldiers of the army or be it the people of the Air Force or be it the people of NCR or be it the Paramilitary Forces, everybody gets connected to the service of the disaster victims at such a time.
And 247 Control from helpline number 1078 is continuously working to tackle the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government machinery was prepared by mock drilling at maximum places before the rainy season.
NCR teams were set up.
Gradually, we also made the habit of creating our activities according to the weather forecast, so we can avoid losses.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country are more prepared than me.
This time there have been so many letters about GST, so many phone calls have come up and people still express happiness and curiosity about GST.
I also recite to you one phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the speech of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax-GST was started in our country on the same date last month.
Can you tell me if the results are coming after a month just as the government had expressed it or not
I'd like to hear your thoughts about it, thank you.
GST has been implemented for nearly a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very pleased and happy that when a poor person writes to me a letter tells me how the prices have come down due to GST, how the prices have come down due to the needs of a poor person, how the things have become cheaper.
If a person living in north-east, remote mountains and forests writes a letter that initially he was scared of knowing what was wrong, but now when I started learning and understanding it, I feel that it has become easier than ever before.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers' trust in the trader has started increasing.
Just now I was seeing how GST was implified on transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How the time is decreasing in distances
Highways clutter freeze.
Due to the speed of trucks, pollution has also decreased.
The goods are also reaching very quickly.
This is not only the facility but also the economic momentum.
Earlier, due to different tax structures, maximum resources of transport and logistics sector were required to be maintained and they had to create new warehouses within every state.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Tax, has indeed created a very positive impact on our economy in a very short time.
The speed at which smooth transition has taken place, the speed at which migration has taken place and new registrations have taken place has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes the pundits of the economy, the pundits of management and the pundits of technology will definitely write the use of GST in the form of a model before the world.
There will be a case study for many universities of the world.
Because it is a huge height of success in itself, it is such a huge challenge on such a large scale and it is impossible to implement it in such a large country with the involving crores of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation in it, all the states have the responsibility.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center together with the consensus.
And as a result of that every government had the same priority that there was no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I congratulate all the Ministries engaged in this work, all the departments, all the officers of the central and state governments from the bottom of my heart.
GST is a great example of the success of India's collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform, it is an economy that strengthens the culture of new integrity.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again I salute all the people of the country for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a comfortable way, we have been listening to this since childhood and this is the reason that the Non-Cooperation Movement started on August 1, 1920.
The uit India Movement commenced on 9th August, 1942, known as the August Revolution and the 15th August, 1947 Freedom.
In a way, several incidents in the month of August are particularly linked to the freedom struggle.
But very few people know that this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali to leave India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country who were associated with the freedom struggle, struggled and endured. The pages of history are our inspiration for building a grand India.
What can be a bigger inspiration than our freedom fighters have sacrificed, penance and sacrificed.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This movement had resolved the entire country for the freedom from the British Raj.
This was the time when the people of India had become a part of the uit India Movement in protest of British power in every corner of India, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, whether it is educated or illiterate, poor or rich.
People's anger was at its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were staging their lives in conflict with the mantra of Do or Die.
Millions of youth of the country had left their studies, had left the books.
The Non-Cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 show two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The format of the non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity increased so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave a mantra of do or die.
There was public support, peoples capabilities, peoples resolve and peoples struggle behind all these successes.
The whole country was fighting together.
And I sometimes think that if we look at the pages of history by adding a little, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
Starting from 1857, the freedom struggle continued in some corner of the country till 1942.
This long period created the feeling of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to doing something or something.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People used to come, join, go, go, come, join and join new ones and the country continued to strive every moment to uproot the British Empire.
With this hard work from 1857 to 1942, this movement created a situation that reached its peak in 1942 and it was a buzz of quit India that the British had to go within 5 years in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached out to the masses.
And from 1942 to 1947, five years, it became such a peoples mind. With the success of five decisive years of solemn pledge, it became the reason for giving freedom to the country.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want you to connect with this mathematics.
In 1947 we became free.
Today is 2017.
It's been 70 years.
Governments came-Gai
Arrangements were made, changed, flourished, increased.
Everyone has worked in their own way to free the country from problems.
Successes also got
Expectations also awakened
Like 1942 to 1947, there was a decisive five years of perfection from resolution.
I see that from 2017 to 2022, a five-year-old section of Sankalp se Siddhi has come to us.
We will celebrate 15th August of 2017 as a festival of resolutions and we will continue to transform that resolution when it will be 75 years of independence in 2022.
There are crores of resolutions.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolutions.
So, just like 1942 to 1947, five years have become decisive for the country's independence, these five years can be decisive and decisive for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of the country's independence.
Then all of us have to take a firm resolve today.
2017 is to make a year of our resolution.
We have to connect with this August month resolution and we have to resolve.
Come, from August 9 this month, run a Mahabhiyan of Siddhi from Sankalp.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Young organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
You can expose new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
As a person, what can I contribute to it
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
Using technology, video, post, blog, articles, new ideas have come up with all these things.
Convert this campaign into a mass movement.
This ui is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must spread and propagate it.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Servant of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am only a person who does not speak there.
The voice of 1. 25 billion Indians echoes from the Red Fort.
I am glad that every corner of the country has been suggesting that what should I say on August 15, which issues should be taken for the last 3 years.
This time also I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov either on NarendraModiApp.
I myself read it and I will try to reveal it in the time I have on August 15.
In my speeches on 15th August last three times, I have heard a complaint constantly that my speech becomes a bit longer.
I have tried to make rules for me in 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
But I intend to try this time to minimize my speech .
See whether success is achieved or not.
I would like to say another thing today, my countrymen.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate that.
Our festivals, our festivals, these are not just occasions of joy and prosperity.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign of social reform.
And a natural joy is also added to these festivals.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in family, brotherhood in society.
Connect individuals and society.
A simple journey from person to world runs.
It becomes an opportunity to move from ego to vaim.
As far as the economy is concerned, hundreds of families start making Rakhia in small domestic industries from several months before Rakhi.
From Khadi to silk threads, do not know how many rakhis and nowadays people like homemade ashes more.
Rakhi makers, Rakhi sellers, sweets, hundreds and hundreds of businesses get connected to a festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, families go through this.
We light a lamp in Deepawali, it is not just a light festival, it is just a festival, it is not so.
His direct and direct relationship is with those poor families who make small earthen lamps.
But today when I talk about the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think that the countrymen are more conscious than me, they are more active.
For the last one month, the citizens conscious of the environment have written letters to me.
And he has urged you to tell Ganesh Chaturthi about eco-friendly Ganesh prematurely so that people can plan on the choice of soil.
First of all, I am grateful to such conscious citizens.
He has urged me to say this topic prematurely.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
25 billion Indians, Lokmanya Tilak ji had started the public Ganeshotsav with the basic spirit of unity and social awareness and collective values.
Once again in this year of Ganeshotsav we should compete essays, discuss meetings and remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I said very quickly .
I am sure that all of you will join me and the benefit will be that the poor artisans, the poor artists, the artists who make idols will get employment, the poor will get employment.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels for the country be it education sector, economic sector, social sector or sports.
We are proud of our daughters.
In the past, our daughters performed wonderfully in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I liked to talk to them but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win, it was a big burden on them.
He had pressure on his face too, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
I said, nowadays, the time of the media is such that the expectations are increased so much, so much is increased and when success is not achieved, it also gets converted into anger.
We have seen many such games that if India's players fail, then the anger of the country breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and talk about such things, they write such things and there is a lot of pain.
But it was for the first time that when our daughters did not succeed in the World Cup, then 1. 25 billion Indians took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only this, these daughters praised and glorified what they did.
I see this a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you people have got such a good fortune that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hundred and fifty million people.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to recall the August Revolution and once again on 9th August, I will remind you once again on 15th August, and once again on the 15th of August, 2022, 75 years of independence.
Every countryman should make a solemn pledge, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to fulfil his resolution.
We all have to take the country to new heights, to reach and to reach new heights.
Come, let us go together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country will be better and the future will be better with this belief.
Changing weather
This time the heat is also very much
But it ' s good that the rain is moving on its footsteps in time
In many parts of the country the weather has become pleasant due to Jhajjam rains .
Cold winds after rain have been experiencing relief from the heat of the past .
And all of us have seen that no matter how difficult there is in life, no matter how tense there is, be it individual life or be it public life or be it the advent of rain changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated with great devotion and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world Lord Jagannath ji 's Rath Yatra is celebrated .
And the poor of the country is connected with Lord Jagannath ji
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor
And very few people would know that there is a word in English juggernaut and that means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And in the Dictionary Meaning of this juggernaut, it is found that this word has originated from the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my best wishes to all my fellow citizens and also bow down to Lord Jagannath ji in his sages.
Indias diversity is its specialty, its diversity is also the strength of India.
The sacred month of Ramadan is celebrated with purity in worship .
Now is the festival of Eid
On this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you.
The month of Ramadan is the month of virtue, the month of distributing happiness and the more happiness they share, the more happiness increases.
Let us all collectively take inspiration from these holy festivals to share the treasures of the joyful people and move ahead with them.
In this holy month of Ramadan , an inspiring incident came to me in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh .
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside there in that small village. In a way, more and more people belong to the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramadan, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
And within this individual toilet , aid is provided by the government , and they were given a sum of Rs 17 lakh .
You spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for turning this holy occasion of Ramzan into a betterment for the society.
We know that there are three such states in our country Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala which have already been declared ODF.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also declared this week .
I express my special gratitude to the administration, governance and people of these five states for fulfilling this task.
We know very well that if we want to do something good in the life of a person, in the life of a society then we have to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if we have to fix it then we have to strive to remain very conscious for a long time.
Then goes to the body, the habit of mind changes
The subject of sanitation is the same
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone ' s attention has to be drawn
Good motivational events have to be remembered again and again
And I am glad that today cleanliness has not been a government programme
It is becoming a movement of the masses and the masses.
And when those sitting in the government take this work forward with the participation of the people, how much strength increases
In the past, a very wonderful event came to my mind, which I would like to say to you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration there took a big job in public participation
100 hour non stop campaign
And what was the target
Construction of ten thousand household toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in one hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have successfully completed the construction of ten thousand toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vizianagaram district that you have presented a big inspiring example in the culmination of hard work.
Narendra Modi keeps on visiting App, MyGov. in, comes from letters, comes on All India Radio.
Shri Prakash Tripathi, while recalling the emergency, has written that on 25th June he has presented as a dark period in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathi ji's awareness about democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a ritual.
Awareness of democracy is essential and therefore democracy has to be reminded of the traumatic things and the good things of democracy have to be carried forward.
June 25, 1975 - it was such a dark night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget the IDF.
In a way, the country was transformed into a prison.
Anti-vowels were dubbed.
Distinguished leaders of the country including Jayaprakash Narayan were imprisoned in jails.
The judicial system too was unable to escape the shadow of a terrible form of emergency.
Newspapers were completely wasted.
The lovers of democracy fought a big battle and a country like India, such a vast country, whenever they got the opportunity, they showed the strength of democracy in the pursuit of the people of India.
We have to further strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling the pride of doing business in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - The entire world has become Yoga.
People from water to mountains welcomed the rays of the sun in the morning through Yoga.
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this.
Its not like that Yoga was not the first time but today when Yoga is tied to the thread, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries around the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
When people practiced Yoga on the Great All of China in China, people performed Yoga on World Heritage Site Machu Pichu in Peru at a height of 2400 meters above sea level.
In France, people performed Yoga in the shadow of Eiffel Tower.
Programmes were organised at 70 locations in small locations like Singapore and they have launched a week long campaign.
NCC has removed 10 stamps on International Day of Yoga.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at NCC headquarters.
NCC's stature, diplomats in the world, everyone has participated in it.
Once again Yoga has done the work of world records
Nearly 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad have made a new world record by doing Yoga together in Gujarat.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I had the privilege of doing yoga in the rain
Our soldiers also performed yoga in Siachen where there is a minus 20, 25, 40 degrees temperature.
Whether it is TBP, RPF or ISO, everyone has made Yoga their part along with their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share their photos while doing yoga together.
Some TV channels also carried this forward.
Sir, one of my questions is that we had heard you in Kerala that in place of the difference-diversity places on which we give a gift as a gift, we should replace the kind of good boxes as a memento
You had started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but now we are not able to see this much.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had formed a tradition in the government that we will not give a bouquet, we will give a book or handkerchief.
And the handkerchief of Khadi so that Khadi can be promoted.
As long as I was in Gujarat, we all became habituated, but after coming here I lost that habit.
But when he went to Kerala, he once again became aware
And I ' ve just started giving the following information in the government
We can also gradually create a habit
And bouquet ' s AYUSH is very low
Taken in hand once, then leave
But if they give a book then in a way it becomes a part of the household and becomes a part of the family.
And when I am saying this, what a historical value is there for such things
When I went to K last year, Britain's Cueen, Cueen Liabeth invited me to dinner in London.
there was a native atmosphere
He also did a meal with great love, but later he showed me a handkerchief woven with a small khadi and thread in a very emotional voice and shining in his eyes, he said that when I was married, then this handkerchief was sent to me by Mahatma Gandhi as a best wish for marriage.
How many years have passed, but the handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi has been kept in mind.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became part of his history.
I am sure these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also become victims of criticism.
But despite this, we should continue to do such things, we should continue to strive.
Now I cannot say that if I go anywhere and if someone brings a bouquet then I will refuse it and I will not be able to do so.
But still there will be criticism, but if you continue to talk, then gradually there will be improvement.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, there are several types of work.
They are immersed in files, but I have developed a habit for me that I read some letters daily from the letters that come to me and that gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various kinds of letters come, different types of people write letters.
I got the opportunity to read such a letter these days, I think I must tell you.
In the far south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife from Madurai Arulmozhi Sarwan - he sent me a letter.
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economic activity in my family, keeping in mind the education of children etc, then the family would get some financial help.
So I started some work in the direction of supplying money from the Mudra Yojana, from the bank and bringing some goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I noticed that the Government of India has created a system called Government of India Marketplace.
So I have registered myself in it. I want to tell the countrymen, if you get the opportunity, then you will get the opportunity.
is a new kind of system .
And then it has to order
So, all the departments of the government are watching the registry of GDM.
Because there are no middlemen , things are very cheap .
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has registered all the goods that he can offer on this website of the government.
And the interesting thing is that the letter they have written to me is very interesting.
This is empowerment
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship
Perhaps, if Arulmozhi ji had not written to me, I would not have noticed that a housewife is doing a small job far away from the system of GM, its goods can be purchased to the Prime Minister's Office.
That ' s the strength of the country
There is transparency in it, there is an empowerment in it, it also has entrepreneurship in it.
I would definitely like those who want to sell their goods to the government to add more and more.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maimum Governance is a great example of this and its goal is minimum price and maim ease, efficiency and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we take pride in Yoga and on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground connected with Yoga, then our dreams are for crossing those horizons of far-flung heavens.
India has shown a lot in sports and science in the past.
Today, India is waving its best not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Nano Satellites with Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.
And these satellites include Frass, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, USA, nearly 14 countries.
And this non-satellite campaign of India will help us a lot in the field of agriculture, in the field of farming, in the field of natural calamities.
And this is the most weighing heavily satellite of the satellite launched by India so far.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it with the weight of an elephant, so you can imagine how much great work our scientists have done in the field of space.
On June 19 , a thousand days of the Mars Mission were completed .
You would be aware of the fact that when we had successfully made a place in orbit for the Mars mission, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
Having completed a thousand days is an important milestone in our scientific journey, in our space journey.
These days, in sports too, we see that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has become clear that along with studies, our younger generations have started to see their future in sports as well. And due to their talent, their achievements, the name of the country is also illuminated.
Recently, Badminton player Kidambi Srikanth of India has enhanced the value of the country by winning the Indonesia Open
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement
A few days ago, I had got the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Synthetic Track of Athletics by P. T.
The more we promote sports, the more we bring sportsman spirit.
Sports also plays a very important role in the development of personality
The overall personality development has a lot of importance in the game .
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports in our family too, then they should be given opportunities.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season, the atmosphere of continuous festivals, in a way this period is a new experience.
I will once again convey my best wishes to all of you at the time of the next Mann Ki Baat.
We will hardly forget the heat of this year.
But the rainfall is awaiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramadan has begun.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and around the world, especially to the Muslim community.
This is a country that believes in God and those who deny God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have assimilated the art of living together.
And finally, this message gives us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This sacred month of Ramadan will certainly help in furthering this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again convey my best wishes to everyone.
I am glad that a lot of people gave me feedback.
Personally, everyone showed me the enthusiasm to tell me.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not been able to hear anyone's message.
However, whatever I have seen from the point of view of Sarasari, someone has tried to learn music, someone has tried a new musical instrument, some people are trying to learn new things by using you tube and are trying to learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing nature, living and understanding are trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle India had to struggle for independence, how much sacrifice it had to make, how many freedom fighters spent years in prisons.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has achieved a lot at a very young age, so I request you to give some messages to todays generation in this regard.
I am glad that the younger generation is interested in knowing about our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
I went to Andaman and Nicobar many years ago.
Cellular went to see the jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a majestic book in jail.
Writing poems, writing on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of tortures the freedom fighters would have suffered
When I read a book on Savarkar ji's birth, I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, it is a big motivation.
There was no such state in India, no one would be speaking the language of India, who would not have lost his youth in the Andaman jail, in this cellular jail due to the punishment of black water for freedom.
Today, the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji was born.
I would certainly like to tell the young generation of the country about the sufferings and sufferings of our freedom fighters, if we go to Cellular Jail and see why it was called black water.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with nature means nurturing the better planet.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say several times: One must care about a world one will not see that the world we will not see, it is our duty to worry about it, we should also care about it.
Open the room windows, open the doors, breathe fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
A new consciousness and a new energy is manifested in our body when the Panch Mahabharata is connected with the Panch Mahabharata.
We all have experienced this thing but we dont register it, we dont link it to a single thread.
After that, you must see that whenever you come in contact with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore, a global campaign to connect with the nature of 5th June should also be our own campaign.
Our ancestors have protected the environment and we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect, our future generations will benefit.
In the Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the root of power.
And Atharvaveda is in a way the biggest guiding text of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We have been told that Mata Bhoomi: Sono ego isolation:
It has been said in the Vedas that the purity in us is due to our Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, one thing is obvious that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the attainment of knowledge and his great Parinirvana were under three trees.
These days I keep getting news from the states.
A big plantation drive is going on in almost all the states as soon as it rains.
Plants are planted in crores.
Children of the school are also connected, social-service organizations, NGOs are connected, the government itself takes initiatives.
This time we also encourage and contribute to this work of plantation in the rainy season.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a known day for the world.
As World Yoga Day, the whole world celebrates it.
In a very short span of time, this World Yoga Day on 21st June has failed in every corner and is connecting people.
On the one hand, many forces of scattering are showing their distorted faces in the world. At such a time, India has a huge contribution to the world.
Through yoga, we have added the world to a formula.
As yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life because of the lifestyle, because of the increasing responsibilities.
And even at a young age, this situation has reached.
The role of Yoga is crucial for taking unpleasant medicines and passing the day, to lead a stress-free life in such a time.
Yoga is a guarantee of both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through Yoga to experience an interval of fitness from body, mind, mind, thought, ethics.
Just two days back, I have written a letter to all the governments and all the leaders of the world regarding Yoga Day.
Last year I have announced some competitions related to yoga and announced some prizes.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and you asked me to appeal that this time on the third International Yoga Day, three generations of the same family will do yoga together.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents, parents or sons or daughters, all the three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow, there will be a nice coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that just as we had launched a campaign of selfie with daughter and had a very interesting experience.
The picture of these three generations will definitely awaken the curiosity for the country and the world.
You must send me a picture on the NarendraModiApp and on MyGov wherever the three generations perform Yoga.
This will be a picture of tomorrow, today and tomorrow, which will be the guarantee of tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have about three weeks to celebrate International Day of Yoga.
You should also propagate the topic of Yoga for three weeks continuously, spread it and connect people.
In a way, this is a movement of preventive health care.
I invite all of you to join me.
This phone call will also bring you to mind: Pranam Modi Ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today, I always see that wherever you go, the people of Modi ji pay special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
Big and big, children also have awareness about cleanliness.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road.
The government machinery does the work of cleaning, but these days there is a celebration of cleanliness in the society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are plenty of sanitation programmes.
Media also gives him great priority and just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
Very big cleaning campaign run there.
I didn't even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I started thinking and I saw that this thing is correct.
You can imagine, knowing how pleasant I am and how the country is also notifying these things in a better way.
I am glad that cleanliness has also been linked to my visit.
There will be a habit of preparing for the rest of the preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister - but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is enjoyable and inspiring for any cleanliness-loving in itself.
I congratulate all those who have emphasized the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well, that's a funny suggestion.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
Modi ji, while deciding your stay, ask whatever migration you want, brother, if you want to call me then how will the level of cleanliness be
How many tons of waste will you offer to me on the basis of which I will decide my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big will be the work of humanity
One thing I would definitely like to say that we do not consider this waste waste, it is wealth, it is a resource.
Do not see it just as garbage.
Once we start accepting this waste as wealth then many new ways of waste management will come up for us.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a massive campaign of waste management with the help of the people's representatives of cities.
Solid waste and liquid waste are going to be available in about 4,000 cities of the country on the occasion of World Environment Day on June 5.
Two types of dustbins will be available, one of the green colours and the other of the blue colour.
For example, the waste of kitchen, the peels of vegetables, the remaining food, the peels of eggs, the leaves of trees and plants, all these are wet wastes and put them in the green dustbin.
All these things are those which are used in the fields and if you remember the color of the field so much then you will remember what to do in the green dustbin.
Today, I have to proudly mention one thing - if a person decides then how big a mass movement can be created.
This is the work of cleanliness.
And the way in which he connected the people of the entire region and transformed them into a peoples movement, this is an inspiring example in itself.
In the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Reasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir was told that the Reasi Block was open defecation free.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that the entire movement has been flooded the most - the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He himself took out torch trips to spread awareness and inspired people from homes, streets and streets.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the last 15 days, the newspapers, TV channels, social media, the accounting of the present government is going on for three years.
I see this process as a very healthy sign.
This 3-year term has been done on every criterion.
Every section of the society has analyzed it.
And there is a great process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that governments should be accountable in democracy, public-people should account for their work.
I thank all those who took time to discuss our work in depth, appreciate it somewhere, somewhere support came, somewhere shortcomings were drawn, I understand these things very much.
Be it good, less good or bad, whatever it is, we have to learn from it and we have to move forward with the help of that.
Constructive Criticism strengthens democracy.
This churning is essential for a conscious nation, for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of good and bad things on me is the same as on the minds of a common citizen.
Mann Ki Baat sees him as a one-sided dialogue, some people criticise him politically but after such a long experience I feel that whenever I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, I didn't even think about it.
It seems as if I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me these things by writing.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President, the Speaker Madam that he gave this importance to the people sitting in such a senior position by taking time out.
In a way, gave a new dimension to the matter of mind in itself.
When some of our friends were working on this book of mind, they had ever discussed with me.
Akbar Saheb had proposed from the front that the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat would like to prepare a sketch for it through his art and Akbar Saheb gave the form of art to express his love without paying a single rupee.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, by the time we meet next time, there will have been rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the exams will have come, the start of a new life will start.
Come, let us all go ahead in love with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Talk of mind, April 2017
s.
Skill development can give a little emphasis on this aspect in what
You can drive the cycle but have you ever tried to run a cycle with a three-wheeler
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the exams of their children
Those whose exams have been abolished, there will be a relieve of some relieve and where the exams will be run, there will still be a little preservation in those families.
But at such a time, I would like to say that the last time I have talked about the things that I have talked to the students, please listen to them again, those things will certainly work during the examination.
Today is 26th March
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu
And I wish that Bangladesh march forward, develop and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within the entire region by working shoulder to shoulder.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, we have a shared heritage.
National Anthem of Bangladesh is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize but also the Knighthood Prize by the British.
And when the British slaughtered Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the great men who raised their voices and this was the period when a 12-year-old child had a deep impact on this incident.
The brutal assassination of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to the boy laughing and smiling in the fields and barns in his teenage days.
And in 1919, the 12 year old child Bhagat is our beloved, inspired by all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days ago, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British. And we all know that there was no fear of death and satisfaction of serving mother India on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life were inherent in the freedom of mother India.
And these three heroes are still inspiring us
We will not be able to decorate the saga of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
and the entire British kingdom was afraid of these three young men .
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but the British used to worry about how to move forward with them.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23
Was stolen, which is not usually done
And later the British had burnt his body quietly by bringing him to today's Punjab.
Many years ago when I had got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel a kind of vibration in that land.
And I would certainly say to the youth of the country - whenever there is a chance, whenever you go to Punjab, you must replace Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt's mausoleum.
This was the period when the rage of freedom, its intensity, its expansion continued to grow.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - 10th April, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi performed Champaran Satyagraha
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha
For the first time in Champaran, a manifestation of Gandhian thought and Gandhian style was seen in India's freedom movement.
This was a turning point in the journey of the entire freedom movement, especially in terms of ways of struggle.
This was the period when the Satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill-labourers in Ahmedabad and the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts and style of functioning was visible.
In 1915, Gandhi came back from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha based on the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a person who returned to India in 1915, a tenure of just two years
Neither the country knew them nor their influence, it was just the beginning.
We can imagine how much hard work and hard work they must have suffered at that time.
And the Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, the power to know the pulse of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour, organising, motivating, organising, motivating and fighting the poorest of the poor, illiterate people in front of the British Sultanate, shows this wonderful power.
And so the way we feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi
But if we think of Gandhiji a hundred years ago, the Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who started his public life.
We can learn from them how to start public life, how hard we have to work ourselves and how Gandhi had done it.
And that was the time when we hear the names of the big leaders, Gandhi had sent them to the villages be it Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani ji.
On the one hand, filling the jail, on the other hand, spending yourself in constructive work.
A wonderful balance was in Gandhi's style of functioning.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be a disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a large sultanate - a whole new Vibhavna Gandhi had established it not through words but through a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, who would be an Indian who does not want to change India, who would be an Indian who does not want to be a partner in the country for change
India is neither a government programme nor a manifestation of a political party nor a project.
India is the call of 1. 25 billion Indians.
This is the feeling that 125 crore Indians want to create a grand India together.
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know
There are a lot of people who are hungry and worry about their food.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara
Public service is the service of God, it is in our veins
Once we look at it as a collectivity, organisedly, then how powerful it is
It is very natural to criticize, discuss and look at India from a different perspective and it is essential for democracy.
But it is true that if the 125 crore Indians make a solemn pledge, if they decide the path for achieving the goals then the dream of a New India can be fulfilled before our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are done by the budget, by the government projects, by the government money.
If every citizen resolves to follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full sincerity, if every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use petrol-diesel in my life.
You see, the 125 crore Indians who are dreaming of a New India will be able to see this country realizing before their eyes.
What I mean to say is that every citizen follows his religion and follows his duty
So why shouldn't we engage with Swaraj in this journey of Suraj by disciplining our lives, by committing ourselves
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, such an environment has been created in our country that a large number of people have joined the Digital Payments Digital Movement.
Without cash transactions, their curiosity has increased, the poorest of the poor are also trying to learn and gradually people are moving towards it without cash transactions.
Digital payments have seen a substantial increase since the demonetization ban on bondage.
My dear countrymen, we have to carry forward the fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion Indians can make a pledge to work on 2. 5 billion digital transactions in this one year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life .
You don't imagine, but you can do a great service to the country and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, several programmes have been organized for public education, for public awareness.
There is a resolution to do 100 programs across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward scheme
Nearly 12 . 5 lakh people have received this consumer reward
April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
And as it was decided a long time ago, on 14th April this Digital Mela will be concluded on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
A grand event is going to be held after a hundred days .
There is also a provision for a large draw.
Let us contribute to how less cash is, how less behaviour of notes
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I seek suggestions from people for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions.
But I have seen that there is always an emphasis on cleanliness .
A bitia named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a 11th student, has sent a message by phone: - Respectable Principal, Prime Minister, my greetings to you
First of all congratulations to you that you have won this election with a lot of votes
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how important cleanliness is
Every day I pass through the river in which people put a lot of garbage and contaminate the rivers.
That river comes through the Rispana bridge and also comes to my house .
We went to the towns for this river and took out a rally and talked to the people but it did not benefit.
I want to tell you to send one of your teams or to highlight this through the newspaper, thank you.
See, brothers and sisters, how much pain a daughter of class 11 is
How angry he is seeing the garbage in that river
I consider it a good sign .
This is what I want to say. 25 billion countrymen are getting angry with dirt.
Once there will be anger, annoyance and fury will arise, we will start doing something against filth.
And it is a good thing that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, he is giving me suggestions, but at the same time he himself is saying that he made a lot of efforts but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement
The hatred of dirt is also increasing .
Whether it is awareness, active participation or movement, it has its own importance.
But hygiene is more connected to the movement
The work is difficult, but it has to be done.
I am sure that this feeling of awakening in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, indicates a good outcome in itself.
Whatever we hear about Gayatri in my mind today, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I am talking about Mann Ki Baat programme, I have been receiving several suggestions on one thing from the very beginning and most of the people have expressed concern about food wastage.
Half of the plates that you fill in do not fill in your stomach and leave it there.
You have ever imagined how much waste we are doing due to the lies that we leave behind.
Have you ever imagined how many poor people can fill their stomachs if they do not leave their lips
This is not the subject that has to be explained.
However, when the mother serves the little boys in our family, she says that the son can eat as much as you can.
Attempts are being made somewhat but still apathy on this subject is a social treason.
There is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there is savings then the family also has economic benefits.
Think about it for the society, it is a good thing but this thing is that the family also benefits.
I am not urging you too much on this subject but I would like that this awareness should increase.
You will find such people in every state of India somewhere.
His life too can inspire us not to make a mistake.
We should take as much food as we have.
See, these are the ways to change.
And those who are conscious of health always say - keep the stomach a little empty, keep the plate a little empty.
And when it comes to health, it is World Health Day on 7th April.
The United Nations has set a target of Universal Health Coverage by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word expression, but if there is a literal meaning then some people also call it depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally ill and are suffering from depression.
The trouble is that we are not able to understand this thing even in our neighborhood and perhaps we are hesitant to talk about it openly.
He who himself feels the expression does not speak anything because he feels a little embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that the expression is not such that it cannot get rid of it.
A psychological environment has to be created and started.
The first mantra is that instead of suppression of expression, it requires expression.
Tell your friends, friends, parents, brothers, teachers, what is happening to you
Sometimes loneliness especially children living in hostels suffer more.
Everyone in the house is going out somewhere, he says - No, I don't want to come today - I like to stay alone.
Have you ever noticed why it does that
You must assume that it is the first step in the direction of expression.
If he does not like to live in a group of people, if he is going alone in a corner then try not to let this happen.
Give him an opportunity to interact with people who openly talk to him.
Let us inspire him to express his joy and gladness while talking to him. Please take out what kind of frustration is there in him.
This is the best remedy
and expression causes mental and physical illness
Like iabetes become the host of all kinds of diseases, the expression also destroys all our capabilities in fighting, taking courage, deciding and deciding.
Your friends, your family, your premises, your environment - can stop you from going to the expression and can bring you out.
There is one more way in which the UIDS is being implemented.
Help yourself, share their happiness and sorrow, you will see, the pain within you will go as far as possible.
If you try to understand their sufferings, you will do them with service, you will have a new confidence.
By connecting with others, serving someone and serving selflessly, you can easily lighten the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Yoga helps a lot to get rid of stress, to get rid of pressure, to move towards a happy mind.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
This will be the third year.
If there is any suggestion regarding the 3rd International Day of Yoga in your mind then you must send your suggestions to me through my mobile application and guide me.
Whatever songs, poetic compositions you can prepare, you should do that so that people can easily understand it.
I would also like to talk to my mothers and sisters today because today the discussions about health have come out very well.
So in the past, the Government of India has taken a major decision.
The working class women in our country, our women in the working class and their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and they are welcome but at the same time, women also have special responsibilities.
The Government of India has taken a major decision.
These working class women will be given 26 weeks of Maternity Leave at the time of pregnancy, at the time of delivery and at the time of delivery.
There are perhaps only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us.
India has made a very important decision for our sisters.
And its original purpose is to take care of that newborn baby, the future citizen of India, be it proper care of her at the start of her birth, be it the mother's love for her, then these children will grow up and become the treasures of the country.
Mothers health will also be good and therefore this is a very important decision.
And because of this, nearly 18 lakh women working in the formal sector will get the benefit of this thing.
My dear countrymen, the holy festival of Ram Navami on 5th April is Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April and on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the life of all these great men continue to inspire us and give us the strength to make a solemn pledge for a New India
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Samvatsar, I extend my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
This is the time for the farmers to start cooking crops after spring and get the fruits of their hard work.
This New Year is celebrated in different parts of our country in different ways.
Gudi-Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as a New Year in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanvatsar Puja in Awadh region, Twin-Sheel in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani festival in Magadh is celebrated on New Year.
Countlessly, India is a country full of such diversity.
The winter season is going to go now .
The spring season has knocked us all in life .
New leaves appear in trees after decay .
Flowers bloom
Gardens become green
The color of the birds begins to feel like the mind .
Not only flowers, fruits are also seen shining in the sunshine on tree branches
Fruits of summer are seen in mango in spring only .
At the same time, yellow mustard flowers in the fields bind the hopes of the farmers
The swollen flowers of the palanquin indicate the arrival of holi .
Wealthy Khusro has given a funny account of the moments of this change .
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals paint the joys of human life
We are going to depart for Phalgun in the last month in an environment full of love, brotherhood, humanity and are ready to welcome the new month of Chaitra.
Indeed , it is a coincidence for these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions and millions of citizens of the country for the fact that before Mann Ki Baat, when I ask for suggestions, there are many suggestions.
On NarendraModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post, I am grateful to everyone for this.
And so they ' ve said I ' ll give you some information about 104 satellite launches and interceptor missiles
Shobha ji, thank you very much for remembering the example of India's pride.
Whether it is to deal with poverty, to avoid diseases, to connect with the world, to provide knowledge and information - technology, science has entered its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in the life of India
Our scientists have proudly elevated India to the world
SRL has successfully launched 104 satellites in space through mega missions in different countries including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together in space.
And it ' s also heartening that this is a successful launch of the 38th PSLV
This is a historic achievement for SRI but for the entire India.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important - Cartosat 2 - this is the satellite of India and it will be of great help to measure the photographs drawn through it, the mapping of resources, infrastructure, development assessment, urban development planning.
Particularly, my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water sources are there in the country, how much it can be used, what should be taken care of, this new satellite artosat 2 will help us a lot on all these topics.
Our satellite has sent some pictures as soon as it leaves.
He has started his work
It is also a matter of happiness for us that all these campaigns have been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such a tremendous participation of youth and women is a very proud aspect in the success of ISR
I congratulate the scientists of ISR on behalf of the countrymen.
They have always maintained their objectives of bringing space science to the common man, to serve the nation and are also creating new records.
Congratulations to our scientists and their entire team, the less we are
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is about India ' s security
India has achieved a great achievement.
There is not much discussion about this yet, but Shobha ji's attention has been taken on this important thing.
During its trail, this mission of interception technology has successfully depicted the enemy's missile at a height of about 100 kilometers from the ground.
This is a very important achievement in the area of security .
And you will be happy to know that there are barely four or five countries in the world that have this mastery.
When we see new technology, a new scientific achievement happens then we are happy.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life
And those who possess talent, dont allow curiosity to remain in the form of curiosity. They also question within it, search for new curiosity and create new curiosity.
And that curiosity becomes the cause of new discovery
They do not sit comfortably until they get the answer
And if we observe the journey of development of human life for thousands of years then we can say that this journey of development of human life is not complete.
Full stop is impossible
Efforts are made to know the universe, the rules of creation, the mind of man.
New science, new technology is generated from it.
And every technology, every new form of science, gives birth to a new era.
My dear young men, when we talk of the hard work of science and scientists, I have often said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientific era leads to a permanent change in the life of generations to come .
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a major unity type of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Socially useful innovation was invited
Sometimes the problem also demonstrates the importance of science for solutions.
What I mean to say is that in the society, people of this kind of role are very much in the country.
And our society is becoming technology driven.
Arrangements are becoming technology driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, there is a big force on digi-money
Gradually, people are moving from cash to digital currency.
Digital transactions in India are growing at a rapid pace.
In our country, Lucky Clients Scheme, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme has received huge support in the past.
It has been almost two months, 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is a matter of great pleasure that under the Digi-Dhan Yojana so far 10 lakh people have been rewarded, more than 50 thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 150 crore rupees have been given to those who have carried forward this great campaign.
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred subscribers who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received rewards worth fifty-fifty thousand rupees.
Whether it is farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it and they are also getting the benefits.
When I asked him about his analysis, I was glad that only youngsters come to see that even older people come here, I am glad that there are 15 years old youth among those who receive the rewards, then there are sixty-six-seventy-year-old elders.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysore expressed his happiness and wrote on NarendraModiApp that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under Lucky Client Scheme.
Now they drive a car but in a way they have become an Ambassador of this scheme.
All the passengers are given the knowledge of digital all the time.
They keep saying things with so much enthusiasm and encourage others too.
I would urge the countrymen, particularly the youth of the country and the Lucky Clients Scheme, either the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme, the reward they have received, to become an Ambassador of this kind.
Please lead this movement.
You should take this forward and in a way the fight against corruption and black money has a very important role in it.
In my view, everyone associated with this work is a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way you are a soldier of purity.
You know that Lucky Customer Plan - 100 days when completed
The 14th of April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On 14th April, a huge crores of rupees will be drawn.
There are about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
It is just the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
This time the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and the CBI.
I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundations laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to connect everybody to every household to reach BHIM App up to 125 crore rupees.
The impact of the movement that has been going on for the last two-three months is that several townships, several villages and cities have achieved great success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village gives strength to the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill up their food stores.
The hard work of the farmers in our country has led to the production of record foodgrains this year.
All the indications are that our farmers have broken the old records.
This time crops have started flowing in the fields like Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record in the names of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I would like to especially thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of my country have heard the voices of the poor and have cultivated different pulses on nearly two hundred ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the greatest service done by the farmers to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters are particularly grateful for the way the farmers of my country have worked hard on their heads and eyes and have produced a record of pulses.
My dear countrymen, this has been going on in our country by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations, by everyone, in this direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen behaving very well with regard to cleanliness in some form or the other.
The government is constantly striving for achieving this goal.
In the past, a programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments led by our Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which is the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, was held in Telangana.
And it is not just seminars in the closed rooms in Warangal in the state of Telangana, but it is important to use the work of direct sanitation.
On 17-18 February, I had organized a toilet pit emptying exercise in Hyderabad.
Six household toilet pits were evacuated and officials themselves showed that pits used by two pit toilets can be evacuated and reused.
He also showed how convenient the toilets of the new technicians are and there is no inconvenience in cleaning them, there is no hesitation, there is no hesitation in it, which is a psychological barrier, it is also not a barrier.
And we can clean the pit of a toilet just like that.
And as a result of this effort, the media of the country has propagated this thing very much, has given importance to it and it is natural that when an ICD is being promoted.
If the ASH officer cleans the pit of toilet himself then it is very natural for the country to know about it.
And this is the cleanliness of toilet pits and those of those whom you consider to be garbage but from the point of view of fertilizer, this is black gold in a way.
We can see what is happening with the waste.
And that ' s proved
A standard Twin Pit Toilet for a six-member family - this model gets filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and redirected in the other pit.
In six-twelve months, the waste stored in the pit gets completely decomposed.
This decomposed waste is very safe to handle and is the most important manure in terms of manure NPK .
Farmers are well acquainted with NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - it is full of nutrients. It is considered to be a very good manure in the agriculture sector.
The way in which the government has taken these initiatives, others must have done such experiments.
And now Doordarshan has a special programme of Swachhta News
The more such things will be exposed, the more it will be beneficial.
Even in the government, different departments celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada regulatory.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with them Tribal Affairs Ministry, are going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries - Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - are also going to take forward the Swachhta Abhiyan in the last two weeks of March.
We are aware that whenever a citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy, enhances self-confidence
We all welcomed the performance performed by our Divyang sportspersons at Rio Paralympics.
In the final of the Blind T-20 World Cup held this month, India defeated Pakistan and enhanced the country's pride by becoming a world champion for the second consecutive time.
I once again congratulate all the team players
The country is proud of the achievement of our Divyang fellow citizens
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
We can get to learn something from them every moment
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone
They are stepping forward by step and illuminating the name of the country with their achievements
In the last few days, our women sportspersons won the silver medal in Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy.
Congratulations to all those players
March 8 celebrates World Women's Day
Giving importance to daughters in India, increased awareness about them in family and society, increased sensitivity
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Movement is progressing at a fast pace.
Today it ' s not just a government program
This has become a campaign of social sensitivity, public education
During the last two years, this programme has linked the masses, has forced people to think about this vivid issue in every corner of the country and has changed the thinking of people towards the old rituals that have been going on for years.
When it comes to the news that a festival was celebrated on the birth of a daughter, so much joy comes.
In a way, positive thinking towards daughters is causing social acceptance.
I have heard that Uddalore district of Tamil Nadu has banned child marriage under a special campaign.
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme and efforts are being made to ensure that the orphan girls are adopted, educated and educated by the district administration along with orphans.
A campaign to educate Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghar Daughters is being launched in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to re-school the girls who had been drop-out by running their children's school campaign and to motivate them to re-school.
What I mean to say is that the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement has also taken several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are associated with him
It has been diverted as per local requirements .
You also keep connecting with activity
I get a lot to know from you
What is going on on on the earth, what is going on in the minds of the village and the poor reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution
Yesterday, Shri Krishna Janma Mahotsav was celebrated across India
One can imagine that what kind of personality would be there that even after thousands of years, every festival comes with renewed inspiration and brings a new energy and thousands of years old life is such that one can give examples, inspiration and everyone can find solutions to the problems of the present in the life of Shri Krishna.
Sometimes one feels a new feeling of rock lifting, sometimes picking up the food leaf. And therefore, today, when I am talking to you, then I, on the side of two Mohan, my attention goes.
One Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, the other Charkhadhari Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan settled in the city of Dwarka except on the banks of Yamuna, on the banks of the sea in Gujarat, on the banks of the Yamuna, on the banks of the Yamuna, on the banks of Delhi, on the banks of the river, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of river Ganga, on the banks of rivers and rivers, on the banks of river rivers and rivers
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had utilised his duties, his ability, his thoughts, and the Charkhadhari Mohan had chosen such a path for freedom, for the preservation of human values, for the preservation of human values and for the preservation of the basic elements of personality.
Be it the importance of selfless service or be it the importance of knowledge or be it the importance of smiling in the midst of all the ups and downs in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and that is why Shri Krishna, Jagatguru has also been known as Krishna Vande Jagadgurum
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and it is being discussed not only in India but in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served those farmers who were being discriminated against in Champaran, who served those mill workers who were not being paid due wages, they considered the service of the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry, the ultimate duty of their lives.
Whoever, whenever, wherever needed, was always present for the service of Mahatma Gandhi
He not only emphasized on service but also on self-confidence associated with it.
The meaning of the word ' service ' is to do it with joy - service , Parmo Dharma .
But, simultaneously, the feeling of excellent joy, self-sufficiency is also inherent in service.
We can understand this from Bapu's life very well
For Mahatma Gandhi, for individuals and societies, humanity and humanity.
Whether it is Phoeni Farm in Africa or be it Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, they have always been insistent on community promotion and community mobilisation.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places related to revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to insist on organising the spirit of service.
Social-Service and Social-Promotion Community Service and Community Mobilisation This is the spirit that we have to bring into our practical life.
In the true sense, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true Karyanjali.
No countrymen
And collectivity has its own strength
There should be collectiveness and service in the programmes of Gandhi 150.
Our ladies are clubs
However, all the stakeholders of the Ladies Club of the modern era will continue to do the same. However, all the stakeholders of the Ladies Club will work together.
can do a lot of things
Gather books, distribute them to the poor, disseminate knowledge and I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore enterprises.
There is no limit to what has come to mind - just goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and complete dedication and that too for a sense of joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I had inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
Your emotions from within your minds will be stronger than any great literature creation and it may be that in today's time, in your eyes, in the form of a Gandhi written by your pen, perhaps even more relevant.
A lot of programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But one thing in this context is very interesting that I want to share with you
In this Haripura Panels were particularly interesting .
You will remember that there was a congressional session in Haripura, Gujarat where the event of Subhash Chandra Bose's Presidential election was recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Before the Haripura session of the Congress in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of the Shanti Niketan Kal Bhawan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase their heart work during the session.
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose heart work enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
gives a new identity to the constitution .
And this sadhana of his art has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nand Lal Bose visited the village around Haripura and finally made some art canvas showing the lives of rural India
This precious artwork had a tremendous discussion in the Defense.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I expect some solemn pledge from every Indian.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for someone else
This will be a good, true, authentic function to Bapu
Sons of Mother India, you will remember that in the last few years, we have been running Swachhata Hi Seva campaigns across the country for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it starts on September 11 .
During this time, we will leave our homes and work for Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdaan.
Whether it is a house or a street, a square or an intersection or a grand cleanliness drive from Nalia, School, College to all public places
In the same way, we have to work together to eliminate the use of Single House plastic.
This will save money and contribute to protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate him to Open Defecation Free India but will also lay the foundation of a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day
I appeal to the corporate sector to come forward for proper disposal of all these plastic wastes.
It can be recycled
It can be fueled
Thus, by this Diwali, we can also complete the safe disposal of this plastic waste.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit is in a way a gem of knowledge.
We can get what we want in life .
These days , my contact has been very low , but I had a lot of contact before .
Stupid people call stones gems
There ' s a lot of glory in our culture
Until We converted the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborns, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under POSHAN Abhiyaan, nutrition is being made a mass movement across the country through modern scientific methods
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes a thing was brought to my notice
A handful of paddy has become a big movement inside the nashik .
In the days of harvesting , Anganwadi workers gather a handful of grains from the people .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
The donor in it becomes an aware citizen social worker .
After that he himself dedicates himself to this cause , he becomes a soldier of that movement .
All of us have heard of food rituals in every corner of India in our families .
This ritual is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
Solid fodder
In 2010, Gujarat thought that children should be given compulsory food on the occasion of rituals so that people can be made aware about it.
This is a very spectacular initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states people run date meal campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, if there is a birthday or a memorial day then the family members go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food and go to schools and the family members serve and feed themselves.
They share their joy and reflect in joy .
A wonderful union of service and joy is seen .
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can fight against malnutrition effectively.
Today, in the absence of awareness, poor and prosperous families are affected by malnutrition.
September to be celebrated as POSHAN Abhiyaan across the country
You must join it, get information, add something new. You should also contribute.
If you bring one individual out of malnutrition means we bring the country out of malnutrition
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of questions about this and that too. And in the last few weeks, wherever I met the people, there is a mention of Man vs.
With this episode, I have not only connected India with the youth of the world. I had never imagined that this kind of place would become my place in the young hearts.
I never imagined how diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to .
I had never imagined that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of young people around the world .
And what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that since I got the opportunity to visit wherever I got the opportunity to visit as the Prime Minister, and due to International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if I go to anyone in the world, then some or the other five-seven minutes only ask me questions and answers about Yoga.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not discussed Yoga with me and I have experienced it all over the world.
But these days there ' s a new experience
Whatever one gets, wherever he gets a chance to talk, he discusses about Wildlife, he discusses about environment.
Tiger, ion, bio-creation and I'm surprised how people are interested.
Discovery has planned to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their language.
I am hopeful that in such a scenario, this episode of Discovery Channel will help the world in introducing the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in India's Sanskrit Yatra. And now people want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India.
But another interesting thing is that even with hesitation some people ask me one thing. Tell me Modi Ji, you were speaking Hindi and you don't know Bear Grylls Hindi, then how was it so fast
What's this later
It's been shooting so frequently What's wrong
ask with great curiosity
Look, there's no secret in it
Reality is that technology has been widely used in conversations with Bear Grylls.
So I used to speak Hindi but it used to be heard in English and because of that the dialogue became very easy and this is the wonderful thing about technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You must also visit the places related to nature and organisms like nature and will life.
I have said before, I must say that you must go to North-East in your life.
You ' ll be expanded
A country full of diversity will fill you with these diversities as a teacher, as well as with diversity from within.
Last month I had the privilege of releasing Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
Tiger population in India is 2967
A few years ago , half of it was hard
Tiger summit took place in 2010 in Saint Petersburg, Russia on tigers.
It took a resolution expressing concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world.
It was a resolution to double the number of tigers worldwide by Twenty Two 2022.
We doubled our number of tigers in 2019 itself .
Not only the number of tigers in India but the number of protected areas and community resources has also increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister, the habitat of lions was shrinking in the forests of Gir.
their numbers were decreasing
We took several steps one after the other in Gir
Decided to deploy female guards in 2007
Improved infrastructure to boost tourism
Whenever we talk of nature and wildlife, we talk of conservation only.
But, now we have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion
And in our scriptures has been given the best guidance .
Therefore, we need to not only conserve our forests, vegetation and wildlife but also create an environment so that they can flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda ji on September 11, 1893.
This young sanyasin of India, who shaken the human race of the whole world, came out of India's brilliant identity in the world.
The words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893 forced the world to change the perspective of seeing the world towards India.
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji had seen the form of an India that Swami Vivekananda ji had to know about the strength of India
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that 29th August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
For each one, this will be a big interesting campaign for the children, the elderly, the young and the women and this will be your own.
But I ' m not going to tell her nuances today
I want to make you aware of fitness and also set some goals for the country for Fit India.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you on 29th August at It India.
Let us move forward with a new zeal, new resolve and new energy.
My dear countrymen, today we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll wait for your point of view, your suggestions.
Let us all come together to realise Gandhi's dreams of making a India of the dreams of freedom fighters: Sukhay:
Let the inner joy be reflected in service
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
On 26th January, our Republic Day has been celebrated in every corner of the country with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way, is a festival of rituals that also makes the future generations aware of democracy, democratic responsibilities and rituals.
However, in our country, the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens - the depth of debate, the widespread discussion that should take place, is not taking place yet.
I hope that the strength at every level, the strength at every time, the strength at every level, the same strength at every level, is given on duties as well.
Only on two tracks of rights and duties, India's democracy can move forward at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping silence for 11 o'clock in the morning, for 2 minutes.
As a society, as a country, 2 minutes tribute at 30th January, 11th should become a comfortable habit.
Why not be 2 minutes, but it also expresses collectiveness, resolution and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country, there is a sense of respect towards the army, towards the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honored with various gallantry awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal and several categories.
We are surprised, proud and inspired when we know deeply about their courage, bravery and valour.
On one hand, we were all happy with the news of the enthusiasm and zeal of 26th January, at the same time our army personnel in Kashmir who were in defence of the country received brave speed due to avalanches.
I respectfully pay homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware of the fact that I continue to talk about mindsets.
January, February, March, April - All these months are the months of criteria in every family.
Half of the children in the house are exams but the entire family is buried under the burden of exams.
So I felt that this is the right time to talk to students friends, talk to their parents, talk to their teachers, because for many years, wherever I went, the examination was a big problem.
The family is disturbed, the student is disturbed, the teacher is disturbed, a big psychological environment is seen in every household.
And I have always felt that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you if this environment cannot be pleasant
Well, the question has been asked by the universe, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
This festival of excitement and excitement should be such that it has worked hard for a year.
There are very few people, for whom there is a place in the exam, for most people eam is a preserve.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a pressure.
The person who believes in the pleasure will find that he will regret the pressure.
Therefore, I believe that the examination is a festival, take the exam as if it is a festival.
And when there is a festival, when there is a festival then the best thing that happens within us comes out.
The power of the society is also felt at the time of the festival.
This is the power of celebration.
There should also be an atmosphere of festivity in the entire family, among friends and neighbours.
You see, this pressure will be converted into pleasure.
The festive atmosphere will make the burden free.
And I urge the parents to create an environment for these three-four months.
The fact is that these examinations are conducted for three-four months from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh.
It is the responsibility of all of us to change these three-four months every year in our own way by taking our traditions and by taking the environment of our families into the festival.
And you must have seen that when you are happy and smiling, you find the relaxation in yourself, you easily relax and when you relax, you can easily remember your years old things.
One can recall the entire view of what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
And you must know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you are in tension, then all the doors are closed, do not go inside, do not come out.
The thought process gets stagnant, it becomes a burden in itself.
You were the one who didn't tell me.
But whoever was inside came out immediately and came out because you got relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall memory then it is relaxation.
And I say this thing with my own experience that if there is a pressure then we forget our things and if there is a relaxation then we can never imagine. Suddenly such things are remembered, they are very useful.
But when tension takes place then your knowledge, your knowledge, your knowledge gets suppressed and your tension gets rid of it.
And that is why it is necessary that we cannot see the examination in the super specialty of the crop.
It seems that it is a question of life and death.
The exam you are going to give is an exam for your studies throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
What kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you are leading, what kind of life you want to lead, what kind of life you people are not aware of.
In your lives, in classrooms and innovations, there must have been opportunities to pass through several criteria except for the examinations given.
And therefore, the examination has something to do with the success and failure of life, get rid of such burden.
They went to the Air Force to join, fail.
Just imagine, if they were disappointed because of that failure, they would lose their lives, would India not get such a big scientist and such a big president
The points have become the most important.
Because of this, competition has increased a lot, along with tension in the students has also increased a lot.
I would like to be aware of your thoughts on this current direction of education and its future.
By the way, he himself has given the answer, but Cha wants me to keep something in it too.
Marks and marks-sheets have a limited use.
Nothing happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have acquired.
Life goes on. Have you tried to live what you have to do
Is it life that you have got a sense of mission and which is your sense of familiarity, is there any coordination between your mission and ambition
If you believe in these things, you will come after you asking the marks and you will never need to run behind the marks.
Knowledge is going to be useful in your life, skill is going to be useful, self-confidence is going to work and will power is going to be useful.
You tell me, your family will have a doctor and all the family members will go to him, they will have a family doctor.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, do you see the marks-sheet of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge, his journey of success.
And that is why the burden of this number sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I should say that it is not just reading.
You must use it for your criterion.
I was yesterday, where I am today, it is necessary to know.
But if you focus on the marks, if you focus on the marks then you shrink yourself gradually and limit yourself to a certain area and get the marks only.
It may be that in spite of being promising in the exam, sometimes life fails.
Cha ji, one more thing has been said about the competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
One of the characteristics of the life of most successful sportspersons is that they compete.
If we take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years of continuous breakdown of its own record, defeating itself every time and moving forward.
His life is a great journey, because he adopted the path of more competition than competition.
Friends in every sphere of life and when you are going to give an exam then if you were able to study for two hours in the past, can you do it for three hours peacefully
That energy is produced automatically from within itself.
If you are better, you will be careless, you will be filled with utmost faith.
If you make a difference to him, you will be distressed and disappointed, you will be filled with jealousy, you will feel the jealousy of yourself, you will feel the need for improvement if you are equal.
Just concentrate on what I have done before, how I will do better than what I have done.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
S Sundar ji has expressed his feelings on the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the question of mathematics.
Once you learn to apply, the maximum problem will end.
Acceptance opens the way for solutions to problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting the state gives an opportunity to open new ways and therefore accept whatever is there.
You will also be burdened.
One of our acquaintances was in the hospital because of the heart attack. So before the Lok Sabha, Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, he was also a MP, he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not come and ask a single question about his health.
As soon as he sat down and came, he started listening to the situation, the disease is there, no talk, no jokes and in the first two-four minutes he made such an atmosphere lighter.
Going to a sick person in a way as we scare the disease.
I would like to say to the parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought of providing an environment of joy and happiness to the children during the eam
You see, the environment will change.
A wonderful phone call has come to me.
They do not want to give their name to the gentleman.
On hearing the phone, you will know why they do not want to mention their name.
Hello, Prime Minister, I can't tell my name, because I did something like this in my childhood.
I tried to copy once in my childhood, I started preparing a lot for it so that I tried to find out the ways and ways of copying, due to which a lot of time was wasted.
In that time, I could bring the same number by reading the same number as I spent on mapping the brains.
And when I tried to get closer by copying, I got caught in it and because of this I had a lot of trouble for my friends around me.
Your point is right.
These short-cut routes become the reason for copying.
So the copy doesn't benefit ever.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard many times and again that don't copy, don't copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once the habit of copying started, there will never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
If you give the same creativity on the issue of your exams then perhaps there is no need for duplication.
The results that will be achieved by the hard work of yourself, the confidence that will increase will be wonderful.
This basic perception is wrong, it is the root cause of the problem.
If there is a holistic development then there is a life beyond books and it is huge.
This is the time to learn to live.
Someone should say that I will complete all the examinations first, I will play later and then I will do this, then it is impossible.
Have you ever imagined that when all this is so much in front of you, please come out for two moments and look at the trees and plants in the sky, lighten your hearts, you see, you will come back in your room with a lot of freshness.
Whatever you are doing, take a break, get up and go out, go to the kitchen, find something of your choice, get a biscuit of your choice, then eat it, take a little joke.
Even if you don't have five minutes, but give me a break.
You will feel that your work is getting easier.
I don't know if everyone likes it or not, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to take a deep breath.
You see, the body will be relaxed and the relaxation of the body that you experience organs will be equally relaxed.
When I hold meetings in elections, sometimes my voice sat down.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - how many hours do you sleep
I said - Why are you a doctor
No, no, say - The voice that gets spoiled while speaking at the time of election is related to it.
You will get a complete sleep only then you will get a full rest of your vocal cord.
Now I had never thought of sleeping and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the importance of these things, you see, it will be useful for you.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but something will say that the Prime Minister has said, now there is no need to wake up, sleeping.
So don't do this, otherwise your family will get angry with me.
And if your marks-sheet comes on the day you will not be able to see them, I will show them.
So don't do that.
And that is why I would say that it is a very big medicine to keep mind, mind and mind and body cautious.
Well, young friends, you are in the process of examining and I am holding you in the matter of mind.
Perhaps these things will not only work for you people but will also work for you people.
If you can, do it, do not do it if you cant, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So, as I advise your family not to be burdened, they apply to me too.
Make the criterion festival to cross every criterion.
Never again will the criterion, the criterion remain.
Please move ahead with this mantra.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has established its place among the worlds 4 largest Coast Guards with all its 126 ships and 62 aircrafts built in the country.
While fulfilling this motto, the youngsters of Coast Guard are eager to work day and night in adverse conditions to safeguard the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in the Coast Guard in our country, women are also equally responsible and successfully performing their responsibilities by joining shoulders.
Our female officers of the Coast Guard, be it Pilot or be it the work of bservers, they also take over the command of overcrats.
It is considered an opportunity of worship of Vidya.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color de Basanti Chola - this is the same inspiration.
My best wishes to my countrymen on this auspicious festival of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio always fills with its imagination.
Since last month, he has started talking about the mind in regional languages immediately after the completion of my mind.
It has got widespread approval.
People from far away are writing letters.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
However, you must have seen in the newspapers that new people are being caught every day, notes are being caught, raids are being carried out and good people are being caught. How is this possible
L.
Rahul played a 199-run innings I Test captain Virat Kohli gave a good leadership along with a good batting.
Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border along the Chinese border to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but this Diwali experience was something else.
25 billion countrymen, in a unique way, dedicated this Diwali to the army personnel, dedicated it to the security forces, its impact was expressed on the faces of every soldier.
They looked filled with emotions and not only this, the countrymen who had sent messages, had included the security forces of the country in their happiness, had a wonderful response.
And people just sent messengers, not so, they were connected to their minds.
Someone wrote a poem, someone painted a picture, someone made a cartoon, someone made a video, that is, every house had become a chawki like a soldier.
The work is going on, with your contribution, the feelings of the soldiers of the country will be compiled in this book with your imagination and your feelings towards the security forces of the country.
A soldier from the army wrote to me - Prime Minister, for our soldiers, every festival of Holi and Diwali is held on the outskirts of the country.
Yes, still remembers the house during festivals
But to be honest, this time it didn't seem
It's not like the festival and I'm not home.
It felt as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians
My dear countrymen, the feeling that this Diwali, the feeling that has awakened in this environment, the security forces of our country, should it be confined to just a few occasions
I appeal to you that as a society, as a nation, as a nation, be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it an atmosphere of joy, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some form or the other.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times
Some time ago, I had come from Jammu and Kashmir to meet all the heads of the village there.
I had the opportunity to talk to them for a long time
They had come up with some things about the development of their village, they had come up with some demands but when the talk was going on, it was natural, the situation in the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, all these things were very natural.
And so lovingly, with such openness, these village heads spoke, everything was going to touch my heart.
I urged them to go and focus on the future of these children
Today, I am glad that all these Prime Ministers from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promises made to me.
Awakened all the distant people in the village
Just a few days ago, when board exams took place, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the board exams.
Inclusion of students in such large numbers in board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm but I congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads from the bottom of my heart.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I have asked for suggestions from people for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that all suggestions come together.
Everyone used to say that 500- and 1000-notes talk more in detail
While addressing the nation at 8 pm on 8th November, I had talked about launching a grand campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told you that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision.
And I also realized that we will have to face a lot of new problems in our normal life
And yet I had said that the decision is so big that it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards a normal state.
The campaign for emancipation of diseases that we have been suffering for 70 years cannot be easy
I can understand your difficulties well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation.
Despite all the efforts being made to mislead you, sometimes you have understood this path of truth and you have accepted this thing of national interest very well.
Five hundred thousand notes and such a large country, such a large country, such a large number of currency notes, billions and billions of notes and these decisions - the entire world is looking at them very closely, every economist is analysing and evaluating them.
The entire world is watching the fact that India's 125 crore countrymen will be able to achieve success by facing difficulties.
There may be question marks in the mind of the world
25 billion Indians will be able to fulfil their resolutions and beliefs that India has only faith in 1. 25 billion Indians.
And our country will come out in every way by doing penance like gold and its reason is the citizenship of this country. You are the reason for this thing.
All the units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends and friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of various tensions, all these people are working very quietly, assuming this as a sacrifice of service to the nation and as an attempt to bring about a great transformation.
Start in the morning, when the night is over, I don't know, but all are
And that is why India will succeed in it, it is clearly visible
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working in the midst of such difficulties.
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they appear two steps ahead
Someone told me that an old man in Khandwa was accidental
Suddenly money was needed
And I was glad to know that he provided the money to the elderly by visiting his house so that he could help in the treatment.
Such countless stories emerge in TV, media, newspapers, conversations every day.
And their strength was shown .
Today, once again, he has taken that challenge and I am confident that the resolve of the 125 crore Indians, the collective strength of all, will commend this nation by making it a new force.
But the evils have spread so much that even today some people do not have the habit of evil .
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, this anonymous money, and I will find some way and I will bring it back to the system.
They're looking for illegal ways to save their money.
Sadly , in this too , they prefer to choose a way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, by talking about greed or temptation, by putting money into their accounts or by doing some work with them.
But, by kindness, do not play with the lives of the poor
Do not do anything that the name of the poor should come to the record and afterwards when the check is done, my dear poor will be in trouble because of your sin.
And there has been such a harsh law of benami property, which is being implemented, how difficult it will be.
And the government doesn ' t want our countrymen to face any difficulties
Some Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh has telephoned me and appreciated the fight against corruption and black money through these five hundred and a thousand: -Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of Village Tirli, Tehsil Tirli, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh.
It is very commendable that the currency that you have closed the notes of thousands five hundred rupees.
Just like that, I have a phone call from Mr. Yelappa Wellankar ji of Karnataka: -Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Wellankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka.
I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart because you said that good days will come, but no one thought that you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and a thousand notes, seeing all this, taught black money and corrupt people a lesson
Every citizen of India will never have a good day
That ' s why I want to thank you heartily .
Some things get to know through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm of working is also greatly increased.
It is so enjoyable, so proud that what the common man has in my country is capable of
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass through there then they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, in which there is a sense of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
But I don't know that in the discussion on tea, there is a marriage too
I came to know that on 17th November at Surat, there was a marriage that took place with a discussion on tea.
In Gujarat, in Surat, a daughter had given tea to the people who had come to her wedding. She did not have any water, no food programme, no food programme, because there was some difficulty due to the ban on money.
Baramas also considered him equally respected
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - The contribution that they have made in their struggle against corruption, against black money and against black money is inspiring in themselves.
I also bless Navparineet Bharat and Daksha and I congratulate you all for turning the occasion of marriage into a great sacrifice and turning it into a new occasion.
Tea-workers live and Tea-Worker gets money weekly.
Now a note of Rs 2000 was found, what did they do
Four neighbouring women gathered and four went together and paid a note of Rs. 2000. So they didn't need a small currencies.
People are searching for their own ways
See, how the life of the village is changing.
Some people of this campaign have got immediate benefits
The country will get benefits in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Every municipality is hardly 50 of the tax .
But this time , on the 8th of this decision , everyone ran to deposit their old notes .
Last year, a tax of about Rs. 3,500 crores had come to 47 urban units.
You will be surprised to know, you will also be happy to know that in this week, he has deposited Rs. 13,000 crore.
Said three-and-a-half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that also comes from the front
Now the money that has been spent four times in those municipalities, it is natural that there will be arrangements for gutters, water supply and Anganwadi facilities in the poor habitations.
There are several such examples in which its direct benefits are being seen .
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmers are a strong pivot of our country's economy.
On the one hand, every citizen is adjusting himself in the midst of difficulties due to this new change in the economy.
But I want to especially congratulate the farmers of my country today
Now I was taking statistics of sowing this crop
I am glad, be it wheat or pulses or oilseeds, I have accounted for the 20th of November. A lot of sowing has increased as compared to last year.
Even in the midst of difficulties, the farmer has found ways
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority
Even after that there are difficulties, but I am sure that the farmer who is facing all our difficulties, our natural obstacles always stands firmly and stands firm even at this time.
Small traders of our country, they provide employment and also increase economic activity.
Millions and millions of rupees were given to such small people by the money scheme because these small businesses are done by millions and millions of people and they speed up the business of billions and billions of rupees.
But due to this decision , it was natural for them to have difficulty .
But I have seen that now even these small traders of ours are serving the customers in their own way through technology, through mobile app, through mobile bank, through credit card and also on the basis of faith.
And I want to tell my small business brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you should also enter the digital world.
You can also download the bank ' s app on your mobile phone .
You also have PSLV machines for credit cards
I invite you that you can contribute a lot in making cashless society, you can create a complete banking system in increasing your business, on mobile phones and today there are many ways other than the notes that we can run the business.
There are technological ways, safe, secure and quick.
I would like you to help in making this campaign a success. Not only this, you should also lead the change and I am sure you can lead the change.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have been exploited very much.
There is a salary on paper and when given in hand, then there is another
Sometimes when a salary is paid, someone stands outside, he has to pay cuts and labour force makes this exploitation a part of his life.
With this new system, we want you to have an account in your bank, your salary should be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
Once the money has been transferred to your bank account, you too dont need a big smart phone on a small mobile phone. Nowadays, your mobile phone also works as an e-book.
Therefore, I specially urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because after all, I have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmer, for the labourer, for the deprived, for the victim and he should get the benefit of this scheme.
Today I want to talk especially to young friends
We say in the world that India is a country with a population of 65, below 35 years of age
You, the young and the young women of my country, I know, my decision has come to you.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you contribute a lot to pursuing this positively .
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true companion
A wonderful opportunity for serving Mother India has come upon us. There has been an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
I'm not going to talk so much.
The older generation doesn't have as much experience as you have today.
Perhaps the elder brother of your family will not even know and parents, uncles, maternal uncles, maternal uncles may not even know.
You know what happens, you know what happens, what happens online banking, you know, how online ticket booking is done, you know
Things are very common for you and you use them too .
But today the country wants to do the great work, our dream is cashless society.
It's true that 100 percent cashless society is not possible.
And I need your personal help, I need your time, I need a resolution of myself. And you will never disappoint me, I am sure, because we are all those who want to change the life of the poor of India.
You know, there are so many opportunities for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking.
Each bank offers online facility
Wallet means e-butwa
There are many types of cards available
Even the ordinary nature of the phone can cause cash transfers.
Whether it is washing, selling vegetables, selling milk or selling newspapers or selling tea or selling gram, everyone can comfortably use it.
And I have also stressed on making this system easier
All the banks are engaged on it, are doing it
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation who is not familiar with it.
And all of you, I know very well, are active in this great task.
The kind of creative messages you give on WhatsApp - slogans, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, smiles, jokes - I see everything. And among the challenges that this generation of our younger generation has produced in the battlefield.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-G, I repeat, I need your help and you, I am confident that millions of youth of my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business
You can voluntarily bring out this cashless society, this grand campaign to bring the country out of the clutches of these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money and the campaign to free people from difficulties and problems - you have to lead it.
Once you will teach people how to use Rupay cards, the poor will bless you.
If you teach the ordinary citizen these systems then perhaps he will get rid of all these concerns. And if all the youth of India takes up this task then I dont think it will take longer.
Within a month, we can stand in the world as a new modern India and you can do this thing through your mobile phones, you can do it everyday in 10 houses, you can do it by adding 10 houses per day to it.
This country has made a big revolution
My young men, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward with great request.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is carrying forward the cleanliness drive with great devotion.
It seems that the topic of cleanliness has spread in his veins and that is why he remembered the work of cleanliness even on the birth anniversary of his father.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and one of his lines he has written: Soil body, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction
Harivansh Rai Ji used to introduce himself through this.
Introduction of soil body, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction, then his son Shri Amitabh ji, in whose veins a mission of cleanliness is running, he has written to me by writing to me using the poems of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My identity
I respectfully bow down to Harivansh Rai ji
I would also like to thank Shri Amitabh ji for his involvement in Mann Ki Baat and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat your thoughts and your feelings keep me attached to you through your letters, on MyGov and NarendraModiApp continuously.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages, they are going to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all for Deepawali.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is a country that has seen a festival for 365 days in some corner of the country.
The person who sees from a distance will feel that like the Indian public life, this is the second name of the festival, and this is also natural.
The festivals that have traditionally been in India since Vedic times have been a time-bound festival, we have seen the courage to abolish the tradition of external festivals and the changes in festivals have also been easily accepted as per the time and demand of society.
But one of these things can be seen very well that the entire journey of India's festivals, its expansion, its depth, its penetration among the masses, its original mantras are connected to the world.
Efforts should be made to expand the individual and personality, to enhance the scope of our limited thinking, to the universe and to do so through these festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have embraced the festival in a scientific manner.
Today, the whole world discusses the environment.
Nature-Destruction has become a matter of concern.
India's festival has been a tradition of empowering nature and embracing every child and every person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody's responsibilities are being celebrated.
Nowadays we celebrate holidays on Sunday but the older generation, the wage earners, the fishermen, you must have seen that our tradition was to celebrate Purnima and Amavasya for centuries.
This means that even our holidays had developed a tradition of connecting with the universe and science.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I have said, our every festival is an educational festival, it brings about a sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamya - from darkness to light.
By burning the lamp of Deepawali, by burning the lamp of Deepawali, the darkness of the society, the darkness of the individual, the darkness of the individual, the same is the festival of light by burning the lamp of Diwali.
One thing we all know very well, go to any corner of the country, go to the house of the richest of the poor, go to the hut of the poorest of the poor, we see a campaign of cleanliness in every family in the festival of Diwali.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
If the poor will have their own pottery, then the pottery of the soil is also cleaned in such a way that it is just like Diwali.
Diwali is also a cleanliness campaign.
But, the need of the hour is not just cleanliness in the house, cleaning the entire premises, cleaning the entire neighborhood, cleaning the entire village, we have to expand this habit and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
In all the countries of the world, the festival of Deepawali is celebrated in some form or the other.
Many governments of the world, the Parliament and the rulers of that place are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
And they have shared that picture with the world and have done it with great pride.
And what's the picture
Sixteen women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian saris and this photo has become viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
Now the Prime Minister of New ealand had come here, he told me that I have to go back so soon that I have to attend the Diwali celebrations there.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light, is becoming an inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
Several firecrackers invite a very big accident in an attempt to make a big noise.
Sometimes it does not matter what things are there in the vicinity, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, news of accident, news of fire, news of dysfunction, causes great concern.
And a problem also arises that in the days of Diwali, doctors have gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
It is not just a day's.
Say Govardhan Puja, Bhai Duj, say Benefit Panchami, and if you take it to the Prakash Parv of Kartik Purnima, then in a way there is a long period.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern part of India.
In a way, there is a great festival, it lasts for four days but it has a special feature - it gives a very deep message to the society.
But the proverb is that in the world, people worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a very big social message in it .
This is the time to convey my best wishes to all of you but at the same time there is more time for me, especially to thank the countrymen, to express my gratitude.
Over the last few months, the events that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting everything for our happiness and happiness.
On my sentiments, the soldiers of the army, the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work, my heart and mind remain shadowed.
And one of the things was done in the mind that it was dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen for an expedition to Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to bow down my head and say that there will not be any human being in India who has an unprecedented love for the soldiers of the country, who have pride in the army and pride in the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it is going to give strength to every countryman.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, we cannot imagine such a courageous person, your message has emerged as a force.
Whether it is a school, a college, a student, a village, a poor, a trader, a shopkeeper, a politician, a player, a cinematographer, there is hardly any one left behind who has not delivered the message to the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed the occasion to express gratitude to the Army and why not, whether it is BSF or CRPF or ICAI.
Whether it is Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Water Services, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, I cannot speak the names of all.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, a new strength comes in that memory too.
In a message, the strength increases and the country has shown taxes.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did it through art.
Sandesh to Soldiers, there are so many things on this hashtag, all these things have come in a symbolic way.
I have sent a poem to Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chauhan and I would like to read it.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I smile, all this because it is you, it is you, it is you, it is you, the cause of my freedom, you, the cause of my happiness, I slept with joy, because I slept with peace, because you are on the outskirts, because you are stationed on the outskirts, the mount Ambar and the mount of India bowing your heads, the Mount Ambar and the army of India bowing down your heads, you are myself, in the same way myself is peace and blessings are mine.
My dear countrymen, whose maternal uncle is also full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also full of army personnel, such a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Let us hear what the army family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign that has been launched on Deepawali is giving a lot of encouragement to our army brothers.
I'm from an Army family.
My husband is also an Army officer.
My father and father-in-law have both been Army Officers.
So we are full of family soldiers and we have several such officers on the border who are receiving such good messages and are getting a lot of encouragement in the Army Fire.
And I would like to say that along with Army Officers and Soldiers, their families and their wives also make a lot of sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the army personnel are found standing not only on the border but on every front of their lives.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was Open Defecation Free.
Earlier Sikkim was the province, now Himachal too is going to be the state of Kerala on 1st November.
Shri Vikas Thakur, a TBP young man, originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
So at that time he was going to have a village assembly in the village, he reached there and was discussing in the meeting of the village, constructing toilets and it was found that some families were not able to construct toilets due to lack of money.
This development Thakur is one of our patriotism.
And it was only then that Himachal Pradesh had the power to free itself from open defecation.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youth.
I noticed that in the remote jungles of Kerala, where there is no road, it is difficult to reach that village after walking on foot throughout the day.
People never go
Near it, in the urban areas, the students of engineering came to know that toilets were to be constructed in this village.
NCC cadets, NSS people, students of engineering together decided that we will construct toilets.
All the goods, bricks, cement and all the things that were required to be constructed for the construction of toilets were carried on their shoulders and they went to those forests on foot throughout the day.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken up this task, the entire state, I am sure that the kerosene will be freed very soon.
What a big change will be brought about, theft will also stop, the environment will also benefit, our Foreign Exchange will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yeah, it'll be hard, middlemen, dishonest people.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is a guide for all of us.
Everything of them should still be said to the country, how to go, sets the standard for it.
You decide on the basis of this standard.
The need of the hour is that we will have to address the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after the other to get rid of the difficulties.
Whatever our old thinking may be, but society must be freed from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now there are toilets for girls in schools, there are toilets for children too.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel the discrimination-free India.
There is immunization on behalf of the government, but even then lakhs of children are left out of vaccination and become victims of diseases.
A Mission Indradhanush vaccination drive that has been initiated to accommodate the abandoned children, which empowers children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, after cooking food on a wooden stove, the poor mother should carry 400 cigarettes of smoke in her body, what will happen to her health
Trying to provide a life free from smoke to 5 crore families, we are moving forward towards success.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, barber shopkeepers, moneylenders used to get stuck in the interest of the moneylenders.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, is a successful campaign to get rid of the interest-employed.
The beneficiary gets the money directly from the bank through Aadhaar.
This is an opportunity to get rid of middlemen in the lives of the common man.
There is a campaign in which there is no improvement and change, the path to liberation from the problem is being ensured and it is happening.
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October, the great men of this country - the unity of India, who made the mantra of their lives, showed the gesture of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, is a festival of birth anniversary.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain touched me too: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, Sardar Patel has a birthday on 31st.
And as we all know how events have taken place in the country after his assassination.
Sir, I wanted to say that how can we stop such unfortunate events and events
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
One Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya, the Bhagirath work of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
I salute the great man who had done such a great job and had made a successful effort to bring India free under one flag.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, because of his priorities of unity struggled for unity, was also a victim of the anger of many, but he never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for the sake of unity and on the birthday of Sardar, a page of oppression and history hurts all of us.
But, in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of this country.
We should also avoid scattered thinking and scattered tendency, save the country too.
Sardar Saheb gave us Ek Bharat, it is the responsibility of all of us to make Shrestha Bharat.
The basic mantra of unity creates a strong foundation for the best India.
The journey of life of Sardar Saheb started with the struggle of the farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in bringing the freedom movement to the farmers.
Sardar Saheb's successful effort to make the freedom movement a force in the village was the result of his organisational strength and skills.
But Sardar Saheb was just a person of struggle, not so, he was also a person of structure.
Today, sometimes we hear the name of Amul.
Today, people are familiar with every product of Amul and even outside India.
However, very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a vision that he had imagined the unity of cooperative milk producers.
My dear countrymen, in the series of Diwali, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light festivals.
Guru Nanak Dev, his initiation of education is still a guide for the entire human race, not only for India but also for the entire human race.
Service, truth and Sarbat da Bhala, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and goodwill were the basic mantras.
Be it discrimination, be it superstitions or beliefs or be it evils or be it the campaign to liberate the society, it was in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his associate when we had the extreme limits of untouchability, caste and creed.
Come, let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to quit discrimination, who orders us to do something against discrimination, who can be our guide better than Guru Nanak Dev by following this mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas
I salute Guru Nanak Dev, this Prakash-Festival.
My dear countrymen, once again, I convey my best wishes to the soldiers of the country on this Diwali.
Your dreams, your resolutions are successful in every way.
I convey my best wishes to you all for your life of happiness and happiness.
Thank you very much.
In the past, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why I would like to say this thing to the countrymen today and I would like to repeat what I had said on that day that I will continue to be punished by the culprits.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
I would like to especially talk to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the anti-national forces well.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have moved on the path of peace by separating themselves from such elements.
Every parent wants to work fully at the earliest as soon as possible.
Farmers are also feeling that the crops, fruits etc. are ready to reach the markets across the country.
Economic business also goes well.
And for the past few days, business has started running smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and our progress is also the path of our development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem by sitting together, find ways and at the same time paving way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of this rule.
The government has to take some steps to make laws and order.
Occasionally, people who think differently from what we think, have new ideas.
In the social media these days, I get the opportunity to know a lot.
Every corner of India gets an opportunity to know and understand the feelings of every kind of people and it promotes the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th grade put a different kind of idea in front of me.
He wrote that I was very distraught after the Uri terrorist attack.
But there was no way to do it and what can a small student like me do
So I came to my mind that how should I work for the country's interest.
And I resolved that I will study 3 hours a day.
If the country can work, it will become such a worthy citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of happiness for me that you can imagine healthily at such a young age in this atmosphere of anger.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country has a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had tried his best to touch this world of emotions in a very good manner.
And he inspired the common man of the country by giving a mantra of Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan Mantra.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had presented this thing that there is another way for every citizen to express patriotism in the midst of the sound of a bomb.
Even Mahatma Gandhi, when the freedom movement was intensified and there was a need for a stop in the movement, he used to do great success to motivate the intensity of the movement towards constructive work within the society.
All of us, the army should perform their responsibilities, the people sitting in the government should perform their duties. And if we, our countrymen, every citizen, with the strength of this patriotism, if we also make some constructive contribution then the country will definitely scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T. S. Karthik wrote to me on NarendraModiApp that the athletes that went to ParalleyMpix have created history and their performance is the victory of human spirit.
Varun Viswanathan also wrote on NarendraModiApp that our athletes have done a very good job and you should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
You two, every individual of the country has got an emotional attachment towards our sportspersons in the Parallelmpics.
Perhaps more than sports, this Paralympics and the performance of our sportspersons have completely changed the perspective of humanity, the approach towards Divyang.
And I will never forget this thing of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he received the medal, he said that with this medal I have defeated the disability.
There is immense power in this sentence.
This time 19 athletes, including three women from our country, participated in the Parallelmpics.
In comparison to other sports, when Divyang plays, physical ability, sporting skills are the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be pleasantly surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals in the best performance so far - 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze medal.
Bhai Devendra Jhajriya, who received the Gold Medal, brought him back to the Gold Medal in throwing the spear and brought him back after 12 years.
And they were not Divya from birth.
He had to lose one of his hands because of the electric current.
Just imagine, the person who attains the first Gold Medal at the age of 23 and attains the second Gold Medal at the age of 35, has done a great job in life.
Mariyappan won the gold medal in Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of 5.
Poverty also did not come in the way of their resolution.
Neither are they living in big cities nor are they from the middle class rich families.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, the country was given medals with the power of resolution.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, several types of Vijayapatakyas have been linked with her name.
Varun C. Bhati won a bronze medal in a high jump.
In our country, in our society, in our neighborhoods and in our neighborhoods, these medals have done a great job to look at the divyang brothers and sisters of our country.
Our feelings have awakened, but the attitude of looking at these disabled persons has also changed.
Very few people will be aware of the kind of valour that these Divyangjans have done in this time's Paralympics.
Just a few days ago, there was a lympics competition at the same place.
One can imagine that the people of Divyang also broke the record of General Olympics.
This time it has happened.
In the 1500 meter race, the lympics competition that was held in the 1500 meter race, the gold medal winner made a new record in the 1500 meter race and the Abdellati Baka of Algeria made a new record in the race of 1500 meter.
Not only this, I was surprised to know that the fourth number of Divyangjans who did not get any medal as a runner, they ran in less time than the ones who got the Gold Medal in the general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all of our sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a smooth plan for the Parallel Empics as well as for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari in Gujarat.
He also told me a few portions, and I presented it to the people, people were surprised.
On that day, I had the opportunity to release a book and collected successful stories of the lives of some Divyangjans.
There were big motivational events.
The Government of India recorded the world on the soil of Navsari, which I consider important.
Within eight hours, six-hundred Divyangjans who could not hear were successfully used to ead machines to listen to them.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for us to have a three-world record by the Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, it should become a duty of every citizen, it should become an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt.
Now, on 2nd October, when two years are taking place, I can say with confidence that awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we all can say that everyone has tried to move forward one step.
It means that the country has moved forward towards cleanliness.
It has also been confirmed, the direction is correct, the results are so good, they have also been seen by some effort and that is why everybody, be it general citizens, be it government offices or roads or be it railways or be it schools or colleges or be it religious places or be it hospitals or be it the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the farmers, all are contributing to cleanliness.
Midia's friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, the efforts have been immense, and we will succeed, this belief has also arisen.
If we talk about rural India then so far, about two and a half million toilets have been constructed and 1. 5 crore more toilets have been constructed in the coming year.
When I had gone to Gujarat, I was told by the officials that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, on October 2, Porbandar will prove to be a complete goal.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, best wishes to those who are trying to do this thing and I urge the countrymen that we have to free the country from this problem for the sake of respecting mothers and sisters and for the health of small children.
I particularly want to present a scheme for young friends who use technology immensely today.
Everyone has the right to know about the cleanliness mission in your city and the government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
This number 1969 - You will not only be able to know the condition of constructing toilets in your city but will also be able to apply for the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the Corporate World to come forward.
Young professionals should sponsor those who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts in the form of Swachh Bharat Hellows.
This cleanliness drive is not just a matter of being limited to rituals.
Cleanliness becomes a habit, it is not enough.
In today's era, along with sanitation, revenue models are also essential.
It is important to be a part of the Waste to Health and that is why we have to move forward towards Waste to Compost along with Swachhta Mission.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost that is produced from the waste.
Provide these to the farmers who want to go to organic farming.
Those who want to improve the health of their soil, worry about the health of the soil, those who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizers, they should be provided with such fertilizers in certain quantities.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan Ji is contributing a lot in this work as Brand Ambassador.
It's like doing this.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors of Metropolitan cities and commissioners from all over the country are going to contemplate in depth on cleanliness alone.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All topics are going to be discussed.
And I can see that there are fresh news for cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a Jagaran campaign to construct toilets.
He worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 9,000 toilets.
In the past, you must have seen that a team led by Hong Kong Commander Paramveer Singh had travelled 2800 kilometers from Devprayag in Ganga to Ganga Sagar and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made its own departments a one-year calendar.
Every department occuses 15 days, especially on sanitation.
In the coming October, from 1st to 15th October, all these three are going to work together in their respective areas by creating a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two weeks of October, 16th October to 31st October, 3rd and departure agriculture and farmland - Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries.
My citizens are also requested to associate themselves with the work done by these departments.
You must have seen that these days the surveillance campaign of cleanliness is also going on.
Earlier, what was the situation of cleanliness by surveillance of 73 cities was presented to the people of the country.
Now it is the turn of the 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh and because of this there is a belief in every city that we are left behind, we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of cleanliness competition.
I hope that all of us citizens should contribute as much as we can in this campaign.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is taking two years.
I have been urging you to buy something from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time too, I urge that every family should have some or the other Khadi so that the house of the poor can get the water given by Diwali.
On October 2, while Sundays, as a citizen, can we connect ourselves somewhere in cleanliness
You should associate yourself with the work of cleanliness for 2 hours and 4 hours and I would like to tell you that you should share a photo of the cleanliness drive that you are involved in.
If you are video, share video.
See, once again this movement will get a new strength and a new pace with the efforts of our people across the country.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a joy in giving it in oneself, whether someone recognises it or not.
It is his campaign to bring food items, clothes and all these things to the needy people.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and they used to donate the old toys with their families and those toys used to come in, they used to offer gifts in the Anganwadi of the poor settlement.
This is a kind of charity festival.
I convey my heartiest greetings to the youngsters who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji is being celebrated and the centenary year of his birth is being celebrated today.
The principle of 'Sarvajan Hitaya-Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya' - this has been his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can a poor poor person get the fruit of development
He had presented the entire economic agenda to every farm in two words.
The country celebrates their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
The focus should be on the benefits of society, governments, everyone's attention and development to the poor and only then can we free the country from poverty.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of that century.
I salute the inspirational man of all of us, the revered Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji of our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashami, I had started talking about Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
It was my authentic endeavor that Mann Ki Baat should not be a program of praising government works.
How the common man of this country keeps inspiring me
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the manner in which you have praised Mann Ki Baat, the way you have blessed me.
I am also grateful to All India Radio that he not only broadcasted these words but also made every effort to convey them to all the languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who by writing letters after Mann Ki Baat, by suggesting, by knocking on the doors of the government and highlighting the shortcomings of the government. And All India Radio has provided platforms for solving problems by making special programmes on such letters and calling upon the people of the government.
So Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue but a new opportunity for social transformation.
I express my gratitude and gratitude to everyone associated with making it a success.
My dear countrymen, next week, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way, there is a different atmosphere throughout the country.
This is the festival of Shakti-Upasana, the unity of the society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how can it become a festival of worship of Shakti, worship of unity of society
How did the festival of connecting people become
And that is the practice of true power and by then we can celebrate the victory of tax together.
Come, let us practice Shakti, let us take the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on 29th August, the magician of Hockey Dhyan Chand ji is the birth date.
This day is celebrated all over the country as National Sports Day.
I pay my homage to Dhyan Chand ji and on this occasion I would like to remind all of you of his contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in getting India a gold medal for hockey hockey.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked for Dhyan Chand ji - We Scores goals like runs, Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player hockeyed on the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
There was only 10 minutes left for the match to end at that time.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge for the injury with a round.
My dear countrymen, whenever it comes to Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
It is a very positive experience for the common citizen to have such a sense of attachment to the Rio Elympics and to put pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something about it.
Outside cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, so much awareness and so much information.
Reading this message for me, this too became a cause of great inspiration in itself.
A Shriman Ajit Singh has written on NarendraModiApp: Please speak on the education of daughters in Mann Ki Baat and their participation in sports as they have made the country proud by winning medals in Rio lympics.
Some Mr. Sachin writes that you are requested to mention Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the matter of mind this time.
The medals we received, the daughters gave them.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
It seems as if the daughters of the entire India have taken the initiative to illuminate the country.
On MyGov, Shikhar Thakur has written that we could do even better in lympics.
He has written: Honourable Modi sir, first of all, congratulations to the two medals we have won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention to whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to travel a long way in sports.
Our parents still insist on focusing on studies and academics.
Sports is still considered a waste of time in society.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs motivation.
And no one can do this work well with you.
Similarly, Shriman Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on NarendraModiApp that there is a need to focus on extra-curricular activities especially children and youth by taking up sports.
In a way thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
It can not be ruled out that we can not perform as per our hopes.
In some cases, it also happened that our sportspersons who used to perform in India, those who used to perform in sports here could not even reach there and only two medals were found in the medal table.
But it is also true that in spite of not getting the medal, if you look at it carefully, for the first time in many subjects, Indian players have shown a very good performance.
Now look, within the shooting, our Abhinav Bindra ji was in fourth place and he lost his medal by a very small margin.
In Gymnastic, Deepa Karmakar too did wonder - she remained in fourth place, she missed medal due to very small differences.
But how can we forget one thing that she is the first Indian daughter to quote for lympics and for lympic finals
Something similar happened in Tennis with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
We performed well this time in the athletics.
After PT Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar quoted Track Field Finals.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team has reached the lympics.
In Booing, Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the uarter-inal, but Bronze could not.
Many players, for example - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performances are good.
But my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we continue to do the same thing, then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The government of India will go into its depths and will study what kind of practices are being carried out in the world.
We will create a roadmap for what we can do well.
2020, 2024, 2028 - We have to plan with a distant thinking.
I also urge the state governments to make such committees and what can we do within the sports world, what can each of our states do, what can state choose, what strength can we show
And I urge every citizen of India to send suggestions on NarendraModiApp to those who are interested in it.
Write to the government, discuss the association and give it to the government.
State governments should send their suggestions by discussing them.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
I also learned a lot from these small children.
For me, the 5th of September was also Teachers' Day and for me, it was also Education Day.
But this time I have to go for the G-20 Summit and I felt that today I will express this feeling in my heart.
The place of mother in life is as much as the teacher's place.
And we have seen teachers who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichand ji is being discussed around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher from a sportsperson.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of our students.
Teacher's contribution in our lives is always felt.
5th September is the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former President of India and the country celebrates it as Teachers Day.
He reached any place in life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Sometimes I think, I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our erosion in our small villages.
But today I can say with joy that one of my teachers - now she is 90 years old - I receive her letter every month.
And Im surprised that even at the age of 90, he writes with such beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad. Because of this, whenever I see somebody's good letters, I get a lot of respect.
You should have a photograph with your teacher, an incident with your teacher, an inspiration for your teacher. You must share it.
Look, it is also very valuable to see the contribution of the teacher in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a stranger and we all want our country, our society, our family, our every person, his life to remain uninterrupted.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav - this is the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh Utsav, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening and made it a festival of social rites.
And through the public Ganesh Utsav, there is widespread discussion of questions that touch socio-economic life and programmes are designed to provide a new energy and a new momentum to the society.
Even today, public Ganesh festivals have started to take place not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
All the youngsters make a lot of preparations to do this, there is a lot of enthusiasm.
And some people have still made a lot of effort to follow the spirit of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
They hold discussions on public issues, essay competitions and Rangoli competitions.
In the philosophy of the society, the issues that touch society are highlighted in a very artistic way.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through public Ganesh Utsav.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth right.
Suraj should be our priority. Can we not convey the message of this mantra to public Ganesh Utsav
Let me invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of the society.
The festival fills a new life in the life of the individual and society.
Life is impossible without a festival but it has to be molded according to the timelines.
This time I have seen that many people have specially written Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja on those things.
And they are worried about the environment.
Someone has done the compassionate work of Shankar Narayana, he has urged the people to explain to them in the matter of mind that they should not use the idols of Ganesh ji made of Plaster of Paris.
Why not use the village pond made of soil Ganesh ji
The statues made of POP are not favorable to the environment.
They have expressed a lot of pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to all of you, why not come back to that old tradition of ours by using the soil, the idols of Ganesh, the statues of Durga.
It is the service of God that protects the environment, protects our rivers and ponds and protects the small creatures of this water from pollution.
Ganesh ji is a disturber.
So we should not make Ganesh ji who creates disturbances.
I don't know how you will take these things.
Several such institutions and individuals work hard and propagate for the soil.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav - this is also a social service.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Now we should decide that the sculptures that our old families used to build will also get employment and if they are made from the soil of the pond or river then they will get it again and it will also protect the environment.
I convey my best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa will be honored with the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had put her whole life in India to serve the poor.
When Mother Teresa gets the title of Saint, it is natural for all Indians to be proud.
An official delegation led by our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also be sent there on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians in the celebrations that will take place on 4th September.
We have to learn something from saints, sages, sages and great men every moment.
We will continue to find something, keep learning and do something good.
My dear countrymen, what a big change comes when development becomes a mass movement.
Manpower is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India, in collaboration with five State Governments, has made a successful effort to connect people to clean Ganga, to clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, those people were invited to Allahabad who were the heads of villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were men too, there were women too.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of Ganga coast took oath in the testimony of Maa Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of open defecation in their villages of the Ganges coast, run a campaign to build toilets and the village will fully contribute in the cleaning of the Ganga. That the village will not allow Ganga to be dirty.
I congratulate all of them for coming to Allahabad for this resolution. Someone came from Uttarakhand, someone from Uttar Pradesh, someone from Bihar, someone from Jharkhand, someone from West Bengal and someone from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India and the Ministers who have fulfilled this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the 5 states that they took an important step in cleaning the Ganga by adding manpower.
My dear countrymen, sometimes some things touch me a lot and I have a special respect for those people who imagine it.
On July 15, more than a million students of more than seventeen-hundred schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children from seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it had such an impact, it was so emotional that after receiving the letter, when the school came on the next day, the parents handed him a letter to the teacher and the parents had promised that they would make a toilet by the date of the execution.
Congratulations to those who had made this imagination, those students who made this effort and special congratulations to those parents who decided to make their child's letter seriously and toilet.
That's what inspires us.
Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen, in Koppal district of Karnataka, in this district, made a Satyagraha against her family.
They say that they had left their food and that too for themselves, not for bringing good clothes, not for eating sweets, but for daughter Mallamma's insistence that there should be toilet in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, the daughter was stuck on Jid, she was not ready to leave her satyagraha.
When Mohammed Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had done a Satyagraha for the toilet, then look at the specialty of the village's chief Mohammad Shafi that he had waited for eighteen thousand rupees and made a toilet within a week.
Look at the strength of this daughter Mallamma's insistence and look at the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
This is the manpower that opens the way for solving problems.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become resolved.
Some Indians have made it their target.
But everyone is associated with it in some form or the other, everyone is contributing to it.
His competition will be held and those who will be victorious on 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays, you can make a film with your mobile phone camera.
Come, go ahead, you are my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to ensure that our relations with our neighbours are deep and smooth.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new program in Kolkata, the All India Radio Friendship Channel.
Now many people will feel that should the President also inaugurate the Channel of one Radio
But this is not a common radio channel, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
They will share the content between themselves and the Bangla-speaking people will enjoy the AIR on both sides.
All India Radio has contributed immensely to People to People Contact.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate the All India Radio friends that they are contributing to foreign policy too.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of becoming a Prime Minister but at the end I am also a person like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a bit more.
Such emotional events give new energy, new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of India to do something or the other.
In the past, I got such a letter, touched my mind.
A mother, about 84, who is a retired teacher, wrote to me this letter.
If he had not forbidden me to declare my name in his letter, then it was my mind that today I should talk to him by giving him the name and he wrote this letter that when you had appealed to leave the gas subsidy then I had left the gas subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
For me, the letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than a Padma Shri.
You will be aware of the fact that I have tried to send a letter to those people who have left the gas subsidy and some or some other representative of mine should go to him and give him a letter.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter came to this mother and she wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of stove and that is why I am a retired teacher and within a few years I will be 90 years old. I am sending you a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that you can put such poor mothers in the work to free them from the smoke of stove.
You can imagine, as a normal teacher, when a mother passing on the retired pension gives 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers and sisters for freeing them from the smoke of stove and for giving gas connection.
The question is not about 50 thousand rupees, the question is about the feelings of that mother and these kind of mothers and sisters are their blessings so that my country becomes confident and empowered.
And he did not even write to me as the Prime Minister, he wrote a direct letter - Modi Bhaiya.
I salute that mother and I also salute all the mothers of India who have been suffering themselves and have always been doing something for the benefit of somebody.
My dear countrymen, we were troubled by the famine last year but this month of August was filled with the difficulties of floods.
There were frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, the central government, the local bodies, social institutions and citizens have made every effort to do whatever they can.
But even among the news of these floods, there were reports that needed to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, let's go together, how big can we get
This will be remembered in the month of August this year.
In August 2016, a large number of political parties, non-subscribing parties against each other and nearly 90 parties across the country, a large number of parties in the Parliament, passed the GST legislation.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And this is an example of the great work that happens when all the teams move together in one direction.
In the same way, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together talked about Kashmir with one voice.
He also conveyed the message to the world, also conveyed the message to the separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And all of us are of the view that we are of the opinion of 1. 25 billion Indians, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, that if anyone knows about Kashmir, whether it is of a young man or a securityman, this loss is of ours, it is of our own, it is of our own country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by taking forward these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, we all have the responsibility of empowering, highlighting and making the country a bright future to keep the country full of diversity in the bonds of unity.
I have faith in the power of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, this morning, I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi. And I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports throughout the country will paint every youngster with enthusiasm.
We all know that within a few days, the world's largest sports event is going to be Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to resonate in our ears.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much, but the sportspersons who have taken part in the Rio also have the privilege of encouraging them.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a very good event - Run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Khilo.
We should do something in the days to come, wherever we may be, to encourage our players.
No matter how much fond of eating, everything has to be left.
I'm ready to do this on your behalf.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to become a postman to convey your message to these players.
If there are no research and innovations then just as the stagnant water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to live without research and innovation on the basis of old technology, then we will be out of time in the changing world and hence the government has also taken several steps for this thing.
And that is why I say - let us aim to innovate and when I say let us aim to innovate, then my AIDS will be innovative.
If we want to prepare the next generation innovators then our children will have to connect with them and that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of an Atal Tinkering Cabs.
Wherever there will be such tinkering absentablishment in schools, Rs. 10 lakh will be given to them and Rs. 10 lakh will be given for maintenance in five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous Incubation Centre, we get a system for innovation, for start-ups, and for bringing it to a position.
In the same way, India is facing many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technology solutions.
We have called upon an Atal Grand Challenges to the younger generation of the country to find solutions, find ways of technology, research, innovation and bring them.
The Government of India wants to promote the technology discovered to solve our problems by giving them special awards.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worrying about famine and these days even the joy of rains is coming and the news of floods is also coming up.
The State Government and the Central Government are working together to assist the flood victims.
Because of the rains, every heart, every human mind gets thrilled because there is rains and cultivation in the centre of our entire economic activity.
Sometimes there is a disease that we regret for life.
Engue can be avoided.
Keep in mind a little bit of hygiene, be a little cautious and try to stay safe, pay special attention to the children. And this is not the idea that such a disease occurs in a poor settlement.
Engue comes first in a luxurious and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen advertisements on TV but sometimes we remain a little indifferent about awareness about it.
The government, hospitals, doctors, they will certainly do their job but we should not enter the enguage in our homes, in our neighbourhood, in our family and be cautious about the diseases caused by water, that is why I will pray to you.
I want to draw your attention towards another trouble, my dear countrymen.
Life has become so turbulent, it has become so rampant that sometimes we dont have time to think for ourselves.
If he falls sick, then he feels like healing quickly and hence someone puts antibiotics in his body.
Immediately one gets rid of the disease, but my dear countrymen, these pathways can create a grave crisis in taking antibiotics.
You may be relieved for a few moments, but without the advice of the doctors, we stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course of the day the doctor has asked you to take.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves at a rapid pace that medicines have no effect.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance and therefore it is equally important to follow the rules of antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
Sometimes there is a lot of anxiety about the lives of the mothers in our country.
About 30 million women in our country undergo pregnancy every year, but some mothers die at the time of delivery, sometimes mother dies, sometimes the child dies, sometimes the child and the mother both die.
It is true that in the last decade, there has been a decrease in the rate of untimely death of mothers, but still they are unable to save the lives of pregnant mothers in large quantities.
Deficiency of blood during or after pregnancy, childbirth infection, high BP - When does not know what trouble destroys her life
Keeping these in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be checked free of cost in government health centers.
The lives of both mothers and children can be saved. And I specially told the Gynecologist that you cannot serve the poor mothers free of cost on the 9th of the month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not spend twelve days in a year for the poor
I'm sure you'll join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world - climate change, global warming and environment - is a matter of great concern.
It is discussed collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Even in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna talks about the tree, worrying about the tree in the battlefield also means that we can guess how much its importance will be.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says - Ashwatha: I am a peepal in all the trees i.e. all the trees.
Shukracharya policy says - Nasti originals are unnatural - there is no vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
He gives a wire to a tree like a tree in the world as well.
Therefore, parents who wish for their welfare should plant good trees and follow them like their children.
Our scriptures, be it Venus or Venus or Discipline Festival of the Mahabharata - there are some people in today's generation who live up to these ideals.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came to my mind.
In the Discipline Festival of the Mahabharata, it is said that trees also fulfill the responsibility of children in the world and Sonal has taken the initiative not only of his parents but also of fulfilling the wishes of the society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, married his granddaughter Sonal in a big motivational way.
Such a scene that touched the mind was in that picture.
This idea came to him and presented a mango sapling to him at the wedding. See, the love of nature was manifested in such a way.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal story of love and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatre for this innovative endeavour.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pedestrians visited the temple of Ambaji in the month of Bhadra. Once a social service organization decided that those who will come to the temple, they will plant the prasad in the temple and will ask them that look, this is the prasad of Mata ji, this plant will be made big by visiting their village and mother will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we waste our land by fencing on the edge of our fields, why dont we cultivate timber in the place of that fence.
Today, India has to bring billions of trillions of trillions of trillions of timbers from abroad to build a house, to build a urnitude.
If we plant such trees at the edge of our farms that are used at the edge of our farms then we can sell them after fifteen-twenty years by cutting them off from the government's permission.
In the past, several states have launched a lot of campaigns using this season, the Government of India has passed an AMPA law just now, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to go for plantation.
I have been told that the Government of Maharashtra has planted about two and a half million saplings in the entire state on July 1, and next year they have resolved to plant three crore saplings.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert Festival has been organized and we have resolved to plant twenty five lakh saplings.
Twenty-five lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know that how big a step has been taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover city percent till Twenty Two-Nine (2029).
There is a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav in Gujarat too.
This year, Gujarat has taken up a number of projects like Amra Forest, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest as a Van Mahotsav and has launched a campaign to plant millions of trees.
I can not mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and when it is on a foreign tour then it is diplomacy, there are trade issues, there are discussions about security and there are several MoUs - all this has to be done.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was a pilgrimage.
It is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela when they remember South Africa.
When these words fall on the ears of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, Gandhi and Mandela appear in front of us.
During my South Africa tour, I visited Phoeni Satellite, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I was also fortunate to have got the opportunity to travel by the train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that was launched to make a Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to say, this time I got the opportunity to meet the dignitaries who had spent their youth for equality, for equal opportunity and for the society.
He had fought with Nelson Mandela on his shoulder and had spent twenty-twenty-two years in jails with Nelson Mandela.
In a way, he had sacrificed his entire youth and I had the privilege of visiting Mr. Ahmad Kathara, a close associate of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Bios, Ronnie Casrills.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they got ready to live for those who lived among them.
On their faces, even after doing such a great penance, it was not visible anywhere.
One kind of duty is not to describe the characteristics of duty in the Gita.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no bigger mantra for any society and government.
Equality and maternity are the only ways that lead us towards a bright future.
Want a good future for children.
The priorities will vary, but the path is the same and that path is the path of development, equality, equality of opportunity, equality of feeling and maternity.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have shown the original mantras of our lives in South Africa.
Being a woman, I'm sorry for her family.
And as technology is doing a very big role in the economic system, its misusers also come to the ground.
Sometimes you might be confused and they write to you in such a wonderful manner, as if it is the right letter.
Your credit card number, debit card number and your account becomes empty through technology.
This is a new method of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I think we should avoid this fascination, be cautious and if such false things happen then we should share our friends and friends with them and make them aware.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought good things to my attention and you would have experienced that, but perhaps you would not have seen that seriously but I feel that there is a need to look at it.
My dear countrymen, while the Parliament session is going on these days, I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country during the session of Parliament.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students of Aligarh came to me.
Artistic paintings have been done at the station.
Moreover, the plastic bottles or oil cans that were lying in the garbage were collected by them by searching and exploring them and by planting them with soil, they made vertical gardens.
And in a way, this vertical garden was made in the plastic bottles towards the railway station and it was completely refreshed.
If you ever go to Aligarh, then definitely look at the station.
Nowadays, I am getting the news from several railway stations in India that local people are identifying their areas on the walls of railway stations through their art.
Feeling a newness.
This is an example of how a change can be brought about by public participation.
Congratulations to all those working in this manner in the country, special greetings to my colleagues from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with you, you are also celebrating festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in temples and shrines and you will also be associated with the festival outside the house.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a special festival here.
Like last year, can not you offer Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Just imagine, give such a gift to sister, who really protects her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of India to be born in a free India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal and opportunity to make a solemn pledge for doing something for the country.
The entire country should be coloured with the colour of the freedom fighters and feel the fragrance of freedom all around.
This environment should not be a government programme, it should be for the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope that you too will do something good related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Send his picture to the NarendraModi App.
Create an environment in the country.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I get a good fortune to talk to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There will be some things in your mind, which you would like to keep your point as intensely from the Red Fort.
I invite you, the ideas that come to your mind that as your representative, as your Prime Servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must send me by writing.
Whatever is said to the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of 1. 25 billion countrymen.
I invite you, let us remember the virtue of the freedom fighters, let us remember the great men who spent their lives for India and take a pledge to do something for the country.
Greetings to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
I am also grateful to All India Radio for their successful efforts to present this matter in regional languages at 8. 00 pm.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later convey their feelings to me through letters, telephones, MyGov website and Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
My interaction with you people and this relationship is very useful for the welfare of the people and for the welfare of the people.
I hope that by becoming more active, you will definitely emphasize on how democracy goes on with public participation.
The heat is going on increasing.
Nearly the maximum part of the country is experiencing the heat wave.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, the trees were cut down and in a way mankind destroyed nature and paved the way for its own destruction.
5th June is World Environment Day.
There are discussions and concerns for the environment all over the world.
This time United Nations has put this topic on ero Tolerance for Village Field Trade on World Environment Day.
It will definitely be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, we have to discuss water and how to increase our forests.
Because you must have seen that the fire that took place in the lap of the Himalayas and forests in Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - I could have done a meeting of all the drought-affected states, but I did not do it.
What the states have to say, listen to them closely.
Generally, how much money was spent by the government of India and how many things were spent in the government, it does not matter much more closely.
It was also surprising for the officials of our Government that several states have made excellent efforts in the field of water, in the field of environment, in dealing with the situation of drought, for the animals, for the affected human beings and in a way, in every corner of the country, the government of any party came to realise that there was a focus on the persistent solutions for dealing with this problem, for a long period of time.
In a way, it was a learning experience for me. And I have asked the NITI Aayog that how best practices should be taken in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh, have made a lot of use of technology.
I would like to further convey the specially successful efforts of the States by the NITI Aayog to us and the States.
Public participation is the basis for a big success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, offer a prasad and even a little prasad falls, there is an irritation in the mind.
They pick him up and ask forgiveness from God five times.
This water is also God's offerings.
If a drop is also ruined, then we should have pain.
And that is why water harvesting is equally important, water conservation is equally important and water irrigation is equally important. Therefore, per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation and minimum water-rich crops.
Now it is a matter of great pleasure that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, someone is using drip-irrigation and someone is doing sprinklers.
I have been sitting with the states and some states have successfully used drip-irrigation for paddy and rice cultivation and due to this their yields also increased, water was also saved and wages also decreased.
When I heard from these states, there are several states that have taken big targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a great job in drip irrigation and they have tried to add 2-3 lakh hectares each year to micro-irrigation.
If this campaign is going on in all the states then farming will also benefit greatly and water will also be accumulated.
Our Telangana brothers have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers very well through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology and ground water recharge in the Neeru PRAGATI Mission.
People are sweating and giving money in the mass movement that Maharashtra has created.
I feel that the Jalyukt Shivir Abhiyan - indeed, this movement will be very useful to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has planned Balram Pond - nearly 22 thousand ponds are not small statistics
Rajasthan and Gujarat have launched a big campaign to revive them as water temples where there are older times.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister's Water Supply Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where water is in trouble.
He has launched a massive campaign of heck farm.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have made small obstacles in the rivers and have launched a campaign to stop ten-ten, twenty-two kilometers of water.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - we decide, even a drop of water will not be wasted.
And this water doesn ' t mean just a matter of farmers ,
This is a matter related to everybody in the villages, the poor, the laborers, the farmers, the urban poor, the rich and the poor. Therefore, if the rainy season is coming, the water should be our priority. And this time when we celebrate Diwali, we should also enjoy how much water we saved, how much water we saved.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
What a precious treasure is given to God
Media has given a detailed account of the problem of water in the past.
I hope that the media should guide people towards saving water, run a campaign and become a media partner for ever emancipation of water crisis. I invite them too.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to create a transparent India.
If we have to bring several systems from one corner to the other, then our old habits will have to be changed slightly.
Today, I want to touch upon a topic on which if you help me, we can successfully move forward in that direction.
If you want salt, give such a vegetable in return.
Businesses used to run from the market system itself.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards cashless society.
We can also get the money, we can also pay the money through an electronic technology system.
You can buy things, you can pay the bill.
And this will never raise the question of stealing the wallet from the ab.
There will be no concern about keeping accounts, there will be automatic accounts.
The beginning will be a bit difficult, but once you get used to it, this system will be simplified.
And this is the possibility that the bank accounts of nearly all the families of the country have been opened by us during the campaign of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
We can move towards this cashless society by coordinating it with Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM).
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with Jan-Chan account.
In the coming days, this card is going to be used both for credit and debit.
I don't need to take out the money from the zeb.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever initiatives have been taken by the Government of India, how should a payment be made through a PSU
It will be very easy to manage through your mobile phones and it is a matter of happiness that NPIC will be able to transact.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your doorstep.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and if we develop a habit then we will not need this currencies, we will not need notes, we will not need money, business will run automatically and due to this a transparency will come.
Look, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobile phones would be in our hands.
Gradually became a habit, now he can not live without it.
This cashless society may take the same form but it will be better if it happens in a short span of time.
My dear countrymen, whenever there are games of Elympics and when the games start, then we sit in a snapshot.
Our sportspersons going for Rio Elympics are encouraged, encouraged and encouraged by each one of them in their own way.
Some songs, some cartoons, some good wishes, somebody should encourage some games but the entire country should create a very positive atmosphere towards these players.
The results that will come - will come.
It becomes a big force in itself, when the player feels that 25 billion Indians are standing with him then he becomes enthusiastic.
I had talked about the A-17 World Cup and the suggestions I received from all over the country. And these days I have seen that an atmosphere of Cootball has started to appear in the entire country.
Many people are making their own teams by taking initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Perhaps, a lot of people would not be playing, but there is so much interest in the sports of thousands and millions of youth of the country that it was a pleasant experience for me.
Cricket and India's attachment are well known, but I have seen so much attachment to Cootball, it indicates a very pleasant future in itself.
So, for Rio Elympics, we have created an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm towards all our sportspersons in the coming days.
Everything should not be done by the criterion of victory and defeat.
With the sportsman spirit, India will make its mark in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something in creating an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm for our sportspersons.
New results are coming from somewhere or the other for the last eight-ten days.
I am talking about those students who have worked hard for a year, who have given an exam, who have started coming after 10th, 12th and one after the other.
It is clear that our daughters are showing valour.
It's a matter of happiness.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
Once again I would like to tell those who have not been successful that there is a lot to do in life.
If the result has not come according to our wishes, then no life is stuck.
We should live with confidence, we should move ahead with confidence.
But a big new kind of question has come to me and I had never thought about this.
But I was surprised that everybody in the house told me this thing, hey man, four marks used to come more, you would get 90 percent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher no one was happy with my 89. 33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, man, you had 90 percent for four marks.
Now I cannot understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life
What did I do, wasn't it good
Did I also fall short
I don't know, I have a burden on my mind.
I have read your letter very carefully and I feel that perhaps this pain is not only for you but also for millions and millions of students like you because an environment has become such that finding dissatisfaction with it rather than satisfaction with it is another form of negativity.
We can never take the society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction with everything.
It would have been better if your family, your colleagues and friends had praised your 89. 33 percent, you would have thought of doing something more on your own.
He has written to me Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, almost like this.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I don't remember the poem completely, but I had read it a long time ago, a poet had written that I had painted a painting on the anvas of life.
Would that any one of the spectators had shed tears on the picture of my pain.
This was the word of poetry, I do not remember it anymore, but it was a poem long ago, but this was the feeling.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I would say so much to you that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, keep listening but keep on talking about yourself and try to do something better.
But if you do not satisfy what you have received, you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success becomes the basis of great success.
The dissatisfaction that has arisen out of success cannot make the ladder of success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
But I want to say this thing more to my neighbours and parents and companions that please do not impose your expectations on them by pleasing with your children.
Friends, did sometimes fail in life, does that life cease
Whoever cannot bring good marks in the exam, he goes a long way in sports, he goes ahead in music, he goes ahead in artwork, he goes ahead in business.
God has given a wonderful mode to everyone.
Just recognise your inner strength, emphasize it, you will move forward.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santoor.
There was a time when the santoor instrument was connected to the folk music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar who handled him and today made an important instrument of the world.
Shehnai - clarinet was in a limited place in the entire area of our music.
Most of the kings and princes used to have a place on their gates.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan handled the clarinet, today became the best instrument in the world, it has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on the health of our poor families also imbalances the tracks of life.
And it is true that the cost of not getting sick is very low, but the cost of getting healthy after getting sick is very high.
Why do not we live such a life so that there is no disease, there is no financial burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for saving cleanliness from disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can do cleanliness.
And the second one for which I constantly urge them is Yoga.
Some people also call him Yoga.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
There is also an attraction and reverence for Yoga throughout the world and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have a precious gift to us, which we have given to the world.
The world with stress gives the strength to live a balanced life.
Prevention is better than cure. Being healthy in the life of a person associated with Yoga, being balanced, wealthy of a strong will, a life full of unbelief and concentration in every work is a comfortable achievement.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just an event, it should be expanded, it should be a place in the lives of every individual, every person should spend 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes in his daily routine.
And for this 21st June Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes a collective environment becomes the cause of change in the life of a person.
See, do it in your village, do it in your neighborhood, do it in your city, in your school, in institution, in even seven offices.
Start a month from now, look, you will become a partner on 21st June.
I have read several times that Yoga and Pranayama are collective in several offices as soon as they get regularly in the morning, the efficiency of the entire office increases so much, the culture of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
I urge you not to stay behind.
Being healthy is very important for making India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I constantly connect with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Dear Countrymen, Namaskar to all of you again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello.
Talk of mind, April 2016
Please change this condition, Ravi ji has expressed his anger, but I believe that perhaps he is not angry with me, he is angry at the situation.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that print only positive news on the first page of the newspaper, he used to keep saying this thing continuously. A few days ago, a newspaper had written to me and he had said that we will not give any negative news on Monday, we will give positive news.
This time also I saw that a lot of letters, comments, phone calls have been received. There are many stories, suggestions, inspirations. Everyone wants to do something or the other.
You will remember that the last time I had talked about a book on Premchand ji's stories and we had decided to share a few things about the books we read with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared information on a variety of books
I was glad that people are discussing and discussing books on subjects like science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, lifestyle, and so on.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many other books
But one thing I have to admit is that now I can ' t spend too much time reading books
But one advantage is that I am getting the opportunity to know about many books if you send them by writing.
But with this experience of the last one month, I feel that we have to take it forward.
Why don't we create a special books corner on the NarendraModi App and whenever we read a new book, write it there, discuss it and you can suggest a good name for our books corner.
Friends, It seems that when I touched this point in the matter of water conservation, but perhaps today I am feeling that water conservation was a matter of touching your hearts, it was a favourite subject for the common man.
And I am feeling that these days the hearts of India have shaken the issue of water.
Several scholarly and effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods
Media has started several innovative campaigns on water conservation
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, something is being done at the war level.
Looking at the competence of collectivity, it feels very good and satisfactory.
Villagers donated labour and gave a definite direction to the waterfalls flowing from the mountains.
That pure native way
This not only prevents soil erosion and waste of crops, but also provides water to the fields.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country which has developed its water policy and water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, the cultivation of crops that require less water and there is no loss to the farmer.
I would particularly like to congratulate the Government of Haryana for communicating with the farmers and motivating them for low-water crops, away from traditional farming.
Now it is time for festivals .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
People from all sections of society reach fairs
We can effectively send the message of water conservation in these fairs, exhibitions, street plays, festivals as well as convey the message of water conservation.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm and especially the achievements of the children and their exploits give us new energy and therefore today I feel like talking about some children and these children are Nidhi Bipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala-Manda.
What I will tell you about them will fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world
It seems that death is at the threshold, but all these ten children, in the battle of their lives, have defeated not only cancer, but have illuminated the name of India all over the world with their exploits.
In sports, we often see that players become champions after winning tournaments or after winning medals, but this was a rare occasion where these people were champions before participating in the sports competition and that too the champions of the war of life.
Actually, this month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports tournament in which young cancer survivors are involved in fighting cancer in their lives.
Competitions like Shooting, Hess, Swimming, Running, Cootball and Table Tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country have won medals in this tournament.
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had launched the A-Sat in March and after that there was not much discussion about the big and important news like A-Sat during the Handrayaan-II elections.
While we achieved the capability to kill satellite three-hundred kilometers away from A-Sat missile in just three minutes
India became the fourth country to achieve this achievement. And now, on 22nd July, the entire country took pride in seeing how Chandrayaan-II moved from Sriharikota towards space.
Photos of the launch of Chandrayaan II filled the countrymen with pride and zeal and joy.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-2, will further clarify our understanding of the moon
This will give us more detailed information about the moon but if you ask me what two major lessons I have learnt from Chandrayaan-II, then I will say that these two lessons are aith and earlessness.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, believe in our talent and capabilities
You will be glad to know that Chandryan-II is completely Indian in colour.
This is Indian from Heart and Spirit
is completely an indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when it comes to doing something new in the new field, it has been decided to do something new.
Just as our scientists, in record time, day and night, by correcting all the technical issues, they launched the Chandryan-II, it is unprecedented in themselves.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
It should be a matter of pride for all of us , and , despite the disruptions , they did not change their time .
We also have to face temporary setbacks in our lives but always remember that we have the power to overcome them.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition, competition and information with the student friends of the country, with the young colleagues and I invite the youth of the country to participate in a quiz competition.
I request young colleagues, students to participate in this uiz Competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable by their stake.
I urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious.
For these victorious students, it will be a historic event in their lives. But for this, you will have to take part in the uiz Competition, get the highest marks, you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and similarly the efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of the people.
Its not that we have achieved an ideal situation in cleanliness but the way the cleanliness drive has been successful in public places, it is the strength of the resolve of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen, but we are not going to stop there.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in Media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but beautiful just a while ago.
He started with his team with Lodhi Garden dustbins
Through the street art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From over Bridge and school walls to slums, when they began to drive their skills, people went along and in a way this process started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during Kumbh.
There is no sound in the colours and lines, but the rainbows produced from these pictures prove to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making the waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward towards making garbage from garbage.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This comment was from Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote like listening to the program of mind
I am happy to state that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in June
I think such programmes should be organized every three months
Besides, the programme should also have online monitoring arrangements.
In my view, this was the first such programme of its kind, in which the public directly interacted with the government.
Bhai Mohammad Aslam ji sent me this message and after reading it my curiosity about the Back to Village Programme increased and when I got to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should be aware of it.
This program shows how the people of Kashmir are desperate to join the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are.
During this programme, for the first time, senior officers reached the villages directly, those officers who had never been seen by the villagers themselves went to their doorsteps to understand the hurdles in the development work, to solve the problems.
This programme lasted a week and in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats in the state, government officials gave a detailed account of government schemes and programmes to the villagers.
How can Panchayats be further strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of ordinary human beings  The villagers also openly explained their problems .
Friends, This programme was not a government fund that the officers returned after roaming around the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
This programme has been included in many other things to make interesting
Sports Competition for Children under Khelo India
The same sports kits, job cards of MNREGA and SST verticals were also distributed.
People of Kashmir become open partners in this festival of development
It is heartening to note that the Back to Village programme was organised in such remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one day and a half days while climbing the hills through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their reception that they stayed in villages for more than two days .
It is very pleasant to organize Gram Sabhas in these areas, participate in a large number of people and prepare plans for themselves.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstruction, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, the Gyanpeeth Awardee Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre has presented the glory of Sawan Month in a poem as follows:
Throughout India, people of different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Sawan in their own way.
In this weather whenever we look around you it seems as if the earth has covered itself with greenery .
All around, a new energy begins to communicate
In this holy month, many devotees visit Kawand Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizes the love of brother and sister also comes.
You will be happy to know that this time Amarnath Yatra has witnessed the highest number of devotees in the last four years.
Since 1st July, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the number of pilgrims who had participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, this time they have joined in just 28 days.
I would like to especially praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey are convinced of the warmth and affection of the people of the state.
All these things are going to be very useful for tourism in the future .
I have been told that more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half since the Chardham Yatra has started in Uttarakhand this year.
After the horrific disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have arrived there
I appeal to all of you to visit those parts of the country whose beauty is visible during the monsoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps, there cannot be a teacher greater than this.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Saawan brings new energy, new hopes and new hopes to you all
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of uit India Month.
I would like you to make some special preparations on 15th August to find a new way to celebrate this festival of Independence .
On the other hand, this is the time when heavy rains are taking place in many parts of the country.
By the way, when we see TV, only one aspect of rain looks flooded, flooded water, traffic jam
The second picture of the monsoon in which our farmers, swimming birds, flowing waterfalls, green sheeted earth will have to come out with your own family to see this.
Rain, freshness and happiness i. e.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Today, people of Christianity are celebrating Easter across the world.
I convey my best wishes to all the people on Easter.
And for some people there will be a criterion because on the one hand there will be an exam and on the other hand T-20 ricket world up.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A nice momentum is visible.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I convey my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
65 of the population is young and we have lost ourselves in the world of sports.
Time is, a new revolution in sports.
24 teams from around the world are coming to play in India.
India won the Gold Medal in 1951, 1962 Asian Games and India was ranked fourth in 1956 Clympic Games.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we went on a lower pair, we went back, we went down and fell.
Cootball is an opportunity, can you give me your suggestions
I consider it a great opportunity to brand India at the global level.
I consider it an opportunity to identify the youth power of India, what was found in the midst of Match, what was lost in that sense.
By preparing for this host, we can decorate our strength, we can express our strength and we can also brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on NarendraModiApp, please
My dear students, you must have thought of tourism during the holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time too, I had requested you people to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, language, food and living habits do not know what to see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you go out to see, you will be watching for the rest of your life.
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to travel a lot.
When there was no Chief Minister, there was no Prime Minister and there was a young age like you, I traveled a lot.
I consider it a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope that when you visit these holidays, can you contribute to cleanliness
Maybe it's not happening very scientifically but it's happening.
Can you also emphasize on cleanliness as a tourist on tourist destination
I believe my youngsters will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
But we should decide that if we want to strengthen our tourism then we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the world's tourism and provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of youth of our country.
Whether it is the government, the institutions, the society, the citizens, all of us have done this together.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, I do not like this thing that the holidays should come in such a way.
You also think in this direction.
Would your vacations, the important years of your life and the important time of your life be the same
I have an idea to think of you.
Can you make a solemn pledge to add a new thing to your personality, a skill in holidays
If you don't know how to swim, then you can make a pledge on holidays, if I don't know how to swim, if I don't know how to swim, if I don't know how to drive a bicycle, then I will drive a bicycle.
Even today, I type the computer with two fingers, will I learn typing
How many types of skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why shouldn't we insist on our strengths
Just imagine, there should be a big classes in it, there should be a trainer, it should be a big bees, it should not be a big budget.
Just assume that I will make a best from the waste.
See something and start making it from it.
Namaste Prime Minister, during the last summer holidays you said that the birds also get warmth, so we should keep them in a utensil and keep them in our balcony or on the roof so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this and I enjoyed it. On this pretext I became friends with many birds.
I request you to repeat this task back in the matter of mind.
And I was not in my mind that today I would say something on this subject but that Abhi reminded me that last year I had pottery outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi for a child.
He called me and remembered a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved those birds very much.
He wrote in his poem - do not let you go away, fill the courtyard with donations and fill in the hood, we will fill the sweet and sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I congratulate Abhi and also express my gratitude that you have reminded me of a very important thing.
Shilpa Cook from Mysore, she has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
They have said that there are those who sell milk to our house, those who sell newspapers and postman come.
Sometimes those who sell a utensil pass through there, those who sell clothes pass through.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer days
Have we ever watered it
I am extremely grateful to you Shilpa. You have put a very sensitive topic in a very simple manner.
It is true that this thing is small but if the postman came to the house during the summer and we drank water then he would like it.
Well, this is the nature of India.
But Shilpa, I am grateful that you have observed these things.
What is the situation in the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the period of good crops these days, what medicines are suitable and there are many topics on it.
Not only this, there is a button in it that directly connects you to agricultural scientists and connects you with experts.
If you put any of your questions in front of him then he answers, explains and explains to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters should download this farmer's facility App on their mobile phones.
So, do you try to do something out of it
And yet if you feel a little less then you should also complain to me.
But our countrymen also have to think about what will happen without water
Is this the time when we are able to provide water to our ponds and ponds through the flow of water to the ponds where there is garbage or some encroachment then the water stops coming and the water conservation is gradually decreasing.
Can we prepare those old places for more water harvesting by digging them once again
If the water is saved in the first rain, if the water is saved, the ponds are filled, if our rivers are filled, then there is a rainy season behind us.
This time you must have seen that 5 lakh ponds and farm ponds have been taken up.
MGNREGA has also emphasized on creating assets for water harvesting.
There will be many such villages in the country, many such progressive farmers will be there, many such aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more fertilizers has sickened our mother Earth and we are the sons of Mother Earth.
This is similar to the Certificate, however best it is, but if we use more and more fertilizers then it will become a cause of waste.
The more water remains, the more it will benefit the farmer, the more it will save his life.
My dear countrymen, World Health Day is on 7th April and this time the world has focused on World Health Day on Beat Diabetes and defeat Diabetes.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes have entered, a lot of illness-fated guests enter their homes and bodies.
It is said that in 2014 there were about six and a half million diabetes patients in India.
3 percent of the deaths are due to diabetes.
And there are two types of diabetes - one type of Type-1, Type-2. Type-1 is inherited, it is inherited, it is for parents, so the child suffers.
And because of Type-2 habits, because of age, because of obesity.
The world is concerned about diabetes, so it has been kept in the World Health Day on the 7th of December.
We all know that our life style is the biggest reason for this thing.
Physical labor is decreasing.
The name of sweat is not-o-nishan, it is not happening.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from the 7th
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we dont hesitate to get medical check-ups done.
And after a very bad situation, it comes to mind that oh, oh, I had a very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was young, I was scared to hear the name of TB.
But there is a lot of TB patients compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that which can be checked soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
If you check once then do it.
And this disease can go.
Just get the right treatment and the treatment continues till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat it whether it is TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But this is not done by the government, the doctor, medicines unless you do it.
And that is why today I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important occasions are coming up in the month of April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Bhimrao Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country throughout the year.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar on April 14 this year.
We have given a lot to Baba Saheb to become a good citizen.
We can pay homage to them by following that path as a great citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Samvat will start.
Different states are celebrated in different states.
My best wishes to everyone for my New Year.
You can listen on your own time.
You can hear on your own mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
The youth of India takes time to get information about it, to see it on TV.
Perhaps there will be no District of India where I have not got the opportunity to visit.
They dont go to the same route, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
And there is a possibility of a lot of employment due to tourism.
And your personality will be recognised by him and by him your confidence will increase so much.
It will probably be a matter of our colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download this Kisan Suvidha App in your mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather in your palms.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Summer has been an opportunity for the rest but it becomes an opportunity for the farmers to sweat even more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gets ready to prepare his farm so that he does not want to waste even a drop of rain.
The time for the farmers to start the season of farming is very important.
Is that the food bad
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were scared but now we have become negligent about TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
You might have listened to my mind on the radio, but the mind must have felt that the exams of the children are being started and the exams of the tenth-twelfth edition of some people are probably starting on March 1.
So the same thing will happen in your mind.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally concerned about your children's exams.
But if we change the way we look at the exams and the way we look at the exams, then perhaps we can be free from worry.
I had said in my last episode of Mann Ki Baat that you must send your experiences and suggestions on NarendraModiApp.
I am glad that the teachers, those who have been successful in their careers, the parents, some thinkers of the society have written and sent me a lot.
The second thing came in so many thousands that I believe that this is probably a very important topic.
But most of the time we have restricted the subject of exam to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
From the suggestions made on my App, it seems that these topics should continue to be discussed throughout the country.
I want to talk to my parents, examinees and their teachers in this matter of my mind today.
I will tell some of the things I have heard, which I have read, which I have been told.
I will add whatever I feel.
But I believe that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for the students who have to give exams.
I would like to recite to you the message that Bharat Ratna Shri Sachin Tendulkar has sent to the youth of India for whom he is proud of: - Namaskar, I am speaking to Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that the eams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
I have only one message that your parents, your teachers, your other family members and friends will be there.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask you how much preparation is going on, how many percent will you score.
I would like to say that you yourself will set up some targets for yourself and you will not come in the prescribed form of expedition.
You must work hard but set a realistic achievable target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
And I always tried to achiev those targets.
My focus was on ball and targets automatically became slovy-slovy behavior.
I would like to tell you that it is very important for you to be positive.
Positive thinking will follow positive results.
So you must be positive and the one above must give you good results. I sincerely hope for it and I would like to give you the best wishes for the FEAMS.
Friends, see what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Don't suppress them under the burden of expedition.
You have to make your future.
You decide your goal by yourself, you decide your target yourself - free from mind, free from thinking and free from capability.
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why do not we compete with ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our earlier records
You see, no one will be able to stop you from moving forward and when you break your previous record then you will not expect anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be satisfaction from within.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a game of marks.
Where did you reach, how much
Do not be stuck in that account.
Life should be linked with a great purpose.
One should move ahead with a dream, one should be determined.
These examinations, whether we are going to be correct or not, are accounting for them.
And that is why if these dreams are immense, then the examination will become a festival of joy in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
Let us move with a very big objective and there will never be anything less than expected in it, then there will be no disappointment.
And you will have the courage to insist, strengthen, and try.
Thousands of people have written to me smaller things than mobile phones on my App.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that there is a healthy mind in a healthy body.
Students should keep in mind their health along with their studies so that you can write well in the exams.
Now on the last day I will not say that you should start a meeting and go for three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that how is your routine especially during the days of exam
Anyway, our routine should be in line with our dreams and resolutions for 365 days.
I agree with one thing from Shriman Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has urged them to sleep on time and revision should be done early in the morning.
Access to the Deamination Centre and access to other things ahead of time.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said that I do not dare to say this because I am a little indifferent to sleep and my friends too keep complaining to me that you sleep very little.
This is one of my shortcomings, I'll try to fix it too.
Sleeping time, deep sleep - this is as important as your activities throughout the day and this is possible.
Otherwise, there is a habit of some people who talk on a long telephone before going to bed.
And when I talk about sleeping, don't think I'm asking you to sleep for an exam.
I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free state to give you a good exam on the time of exam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not be that the marks should come down and the mother asked why the sons came less, then say that Modiji had asked to sleep, so I fell asleep.
Will you not do that
I don't believe you.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if one or half of our body's body suffers from a little problem.
Not only this, our routine is also eroded.
And that's why we don't consider anything small.
You see, don't engage in the habit of composing yourself in the prescribed manner.
Fix it, check it out.
You must have seen these two types of people.
There is a negative impact on the outcome of the paper that will come in its tension.
On Viswanathan Anand, he will share his experiences.
You must have seen that their eyes also do not go around.
Never used to listen to Arjuna's life, how he looked at the bird's eye.
In the same way, when we see Viswanathan playing, his eyes are at a bigger target and he is a manifestation of inner peace.
It is true that someone should say that peace will come back then it is difficult to say this thing, but we should try it.
You are not talking to friends or you are walking alone, you are screaming, you are shaking a lot of books, you are shaking a lot of books, then you cant feel calm again.
You can imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and you can see very good things below.
However, when a stone starts moving in water then what is the best thing that was visible below
If the water is calm, however deep it may be, it can be seen.
But if the water is turbulent, then there is nothing below.
There is a storehouse of hard work throughout the year but if you have a turbulent mind then you will not be able to find that treasure.
If you have a calm mind, then your treasure will emerge completely and your exam will become very simple.
Sometimes I try to understand it by concentrating more and then I feel inner tension.
Then I think, no-no, I'll relax a bit, so I'll be fine.
So I have developed myself with the help of technology.
I'll breathe a lot.
I breathe deeply.
Three times I take deep breaths five times, the time goes 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds but then my mind becomes completely calm and ready to understand things.
Maybe it's my experience, you can also work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If the parents are also educated in the house and if the parents are also educated then they rewrite the entire paper again.
Man, I made a mistake.
Hey man, I knew that, but I didn't remember.
We get stuck in the same.
Scream over the topics with the family and refresh the memories of old joy.
If you ever went somewhere with your parents, remember the scenes there.
Spend half an hour after getting out of them.
The talk of Rajat ji is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting it in the present context, is trying to convey this ritual to Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to the revered Murari Bapu for giving us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you one more thing today.
I can see that Yoga has been discussed in the experiences that people have shared with me this time.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that somebody whom I meet in the world these days, no matter how much time I get, somebody does something or the other.
Well, friends, let me say that today, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least exams, so do not do it today.
Do it then do it.
But it is true that whether it is in a student life or in the second half of life, Yoga is a key to the development journey of inner life.
Simple to simple key.
You must pay attention to it.
Yes, if you are familiar with Yoga, if you ask them about Yoga then you would not have done Yoga before in the days of the exam, you would also tell them about two-four things that you can do in two-five minutes.
Look, if you can,
Yes, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you are in a hurry to go to the examination hall, do you feel like sitting on your bench at the earliest
Why do these things hurry
Why do not manage your entire day's time so that it stops in traffic, even then we can reach it on time.
Otherwise such things create a new tension.
And one thing is, the number of time that we have received, the question papers that are instrumental, sometimes we feel that this will be our time.
It's not like that, guys.
You should read those instructions closely, it will take two minutes or three minutes or five minutes, there will be no loss.
However, with the confidence of the same paper, now I have this paper, no new questions are going to come up, I have to tackle the same questions. And when I started thinking again, he wrote that I understood this paper so easily. For the first time, I felt that it does not come to me but when I read the same thing again, I realized that the question has been put in mind, but this is what I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems difficult to understand the questions.
I would like to emphasise on the fact that you should read the questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match it with whatever you know, you will see that it will be easier before writing the question.
It is a matter of great happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our most respected scientist CNR Rao have stressed upon patience.
In very few words, he has given a very good message to all the students.
The thing that I spend half an hour in saying, they say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of scientific mind.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
What they have said is firmness, devotion, penance, this is the same thing dedication, determination, diligence.
If you stay awake, then fear will also be afraid.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do well.
Now on my App, a messenger Ruchika Dabus has shared his eam experience.
He said that there is a constant effort in his family to create a positive atmosphere at the time of exams and this discussion was also held in his fellow families.
Together, a positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji said, positive approach, positive frame of mind positive energy is highlighted.
You may be at any stage of your life, best examples, true events inspire you, they give immense strength and they also create new ways in times of crisis.
We all read about the inventor of Electricity Bulb Thomas Elva Edison, in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates the lives of our people.
It is said that failure also contains the prospects of success.
J. K. Rolling is a great example that success can ever be achieved by anyone.
Harry Potter Services is popular all over the world today.
But from the beginning it was not so.
How many problems they had to face
Rolling himself had said that in the difficulties, he used to put all the energy in that work, which really meant for him.
Nowadays, not just the students, the entire family and the entire school becomes a teacher.
However, without the support system of parents and teachers alone, the situation is not good.
Whether it is teachers or partners, even senior students, if all these things are combined to become a team, if we move ahead with the same thinking and in a planned manner then the examination becomes easier.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App, he has complained that parents should never put pressure on their children to ask for more marks.
We should encourage only to prepare.
They should be relaxed, they should worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not put the burden of his expectations on children.
That's right.
I don't want to tell the parents more today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he is talking to any of his friends, do not stop.
Build a light-hearted environment and create a positive environment. See how much confidence your son or daughter will come.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Knowledge, science and technology should become an intuitive part of our development journey and this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, sometimes success comes very late and when success comes, the look of the world also changes.
You might have been very busy in the exam, perhaps you might not have had a registrar in your mind.
But I also want to repeat this thing to my countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important discovery in the world of science.
The world's scientists worked hard, the generations came, they did something or the other, and almost after 100 years they succeeded.
Gravitational Haves were highlighted and detected by the valour of our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our great scientist Einstein in the last century, but is also considered a great discovery for Physics.
But as an Indian, all of us are happy that the sons of our country, the promising scientists of our country were associated with it in the process of exploration.
I would like to congratulate and congratulate all those scientists today.
In the future, our scientists will be trying to pursue this dinner.
There are two such systems in the world, India is the third.
By joining India, this process will get a new strength and a new pace.
India will certainly become an active partner in the process of this great scientific diagnosis of human welfare even among its limited resources.
Once again I congratulate all the scientists and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to write a number to you, from tomorrow you can listen to me by missed call and listen to this number in your mother tongue.
I also have to give the exam tomorrow.
25 billion Indians are going to take my examination.
But, you must have seen that I must have heard how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Just, let me get an exam tomorrow, let me start with you all the time.
And if all of us are successful then the country will also succeed.
Friends, I convey my best wishes to you.
Free from the stress of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind.
Talk of mind, December 2015
I take a good look at this portal of mine, Mr. Ganesh V.
No, we have to make changes according to the requirements of India, the poor man earns some wages, he finds physical labour, but some youngster makes such a thing through innovation that the poor get some benefit in wages, I consider this as a start-up. I would like to ask the bank to help such a young man, I would like to tell him that Market will be available, in the same way, is the intellectual property of our younger generation limited in some cities
And then I got the idea that perhaps we feel that he is a handicapped person, but experience shows that he has an extra power, an extra power and then I got the idea of going and then I got the idea of using the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang' in our country. These are those people who have one organ or more organ, in which there is a communication of divine power, which we ordinary people don't have it.
On 26th January, when we observe Republic Day, can we observe the excellent hygiene, best hygiene, best hygiene or beautification on 26th January, by the citizens, by the children of schools and colleges, what kind of statues and statues of great men are there in our city
Dear Countrymen, Namaste
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated the holidays very well.
There would have been an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, trade and employment must have started.
Christmas preparations on the other hand will also have started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes the festivals are used to fill wounds, and sometimes the festival gives new energy.
But sometimes when there is a crisis in this time of festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
Every corner of the world constantly reports about natural calamities.
And there are reports of such natural calamities that have never been heard or thought of.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is growing.
In our own country, the way in which there has been heavy rainfall and that too unseasonal rains and the losses in the long term, especially in Tamil Nadu, and the states have also been affected.
Many people lost their lives
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State governments gather with full force in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I am sure that despite this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, he will start moving at a rapid pace and will continue to play his role in taking the country forward.
But when we look at these problems all around, we need to bring about a lot of change in it.
15 years ago, the natural calamity used to be part of an agriculture department because then more natural calamities i. e.
Today its form has changed.
After the Nepal earthquake, I had spoken to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
There has been a good beginning.
Today, I have got the phone of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab District Jalandhar.
We cultivate organic farming here and guide a lot of people about agriculture.
One of my questions is that how people set fire to these fields, how they should guide the straw or the wheat foam, how they are spoiling the micro-organisms that are being produced by the mother Earth and how these pollutions are taking place in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
One thing is that you are a farmer who cultivates organic farming.
And they themselves do organic farming. Not only this, you understand the problem of farmers very well.
And your concerns are correct but this is not the case only in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of people throughout India and traditionally we follow the path of burning the residue of our crops.
Secondly, there is no training for what the measures are.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come to the cities, a little sound was heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
Crop residues are also very valuable.
They themselves are an organic manure.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the ground burns.
For my farmer brothers and sisters, just imagine that our bones are strong, our hearts are strong, kidneys are good, everything is good but what will happen if the skin on the body is burnt
Similarly, burning the residues of these crops does not only burn the throat, it burns the skin of the Mother Earth.
The layer above our ground burns, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And therefore, he should make positive efforts.
Once again this thread is suppressed in the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if a pit is piled up in a pit and puts some water in the earth then the best type of organic fertilizer comes into being.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivated bananas.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crop was finished, he used to spend Rs. 5,000, 10 thousand and 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the bananas.
And till the people who took it did not come with the tractor-vactor, he was standing like this.
However, some farmers have developed 66, 8-8 inches of that stove and buried it in the ground.
So it was experienced that there is so much water in the throat of this banana that if there is a tree, if there is a plant, if there is a crop then there is no need to get outside for three months.
Today, the demand for slums has increased.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on the 3rd of December, International Day of Persons with Disabilities will be remembered by the entire world.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had discussed the Organ Confederation.
I had also discussed the NEET's helpline for organ donation and I was told that after that the phone calls have increased nearly 7 times.
Film actress Raveena Tandon, very well-known people associated with it.
Organ Convention can save valuable lives.
Angadan brings immortality in a way.
When an organ goes from one body to the other then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation than this
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness on this sector and in the true sense the needy will get the best help because these help cannot be received from anywhere unless someone donates.
As I said earlier, 3 December is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also rich in an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes the pain occurs when they are ridiculed sometimes.
Occasionally a sense of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision and look at them, then they can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to pass through.
If we have a small problem then we sit to cry.
Then I remember that my crisis is very small, how does it last
And that is why all these are a source of inspiration for us.
His determination, his way of fighting with his life and his desire to transform the crisis into strength is immense.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 is aged.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists in Kashmir.
Lost a part of the intestine and intestine.
There was a spinal cord of serious nature.
The ability to stand on his feet always went for help, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
The injury of terrorism did not even bother them.
His own strength, but the biggest thing is that without any reason, an innocent person has suffered such a big problem, the youth has been in danger, but no resentment, no rage, Javed Ahmed has turned this crisis into sensitivity.
He dedicated his life to social service.
The body does not accompany, but for 20 years they have been immersed in children's studies.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for disabled persons in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
Is not the life of Javed enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and his dedication on the 3rd of December.
In the absence of time, even though I am talking about Javed, the lamps of such inspiration are burning in every corner of India.
Are giving new light to live, showing the way.
On 3rd December there is an opportunity to inspire everyone by remembering them.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we are dependent on governments.
For the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the oppressed, the exploited and the deprived sections, there is a constant link between the government and the government systems.
And as a citizen, sometimes a bad experience comes from a government babu.
And that very bad experience changes our perspective of looking at the government system throughout our life.
There is a truth in it but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government do such good work with dedication and dedication which never comes to our sight.
Sometimes we don't even know because we don't know that there is a government system and some government officials are doing this thing.
ASA workers in our country which are networked across the country.
Sometimes I have not heard of discussions about ASEA workers amongst the people of India.
But when I have become an example of his success in the world as a world famous family entrepreneur of the Bilgates Foundation.
We had given joint Padma Vibhushan to those two Bilgates and Milinda Gates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
Whatever their retirement time and life-long earnings are being spent in working for the poor.
Whenever they come and meet and appreciate those ASHA workers who have got the opportunity to work and appreciate them so much, and they have the opportunity to say that what kind of hard work they have done to the ASHA workers.
He explains how much enthusiasm is there for learning new things.
In the past, the Orissa Government honored an ASA worker on Independence Day.
Tendagaon, a small village in Balasore district of Orissa, is an optimist and the entire population of that village is schedule-tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Manisingh, a hope worker from this village, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this village.
If he gets the news of a small fever going from home to house, then reach the house.
Based on the primary arrangements that have been taught to him, it is necessary to get treatment.
Emphasis on using every household pesticide mosquito net.
As soon as his own child falls asleep and as much care as he should, ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh continues to work with full dedication for the entire village to avoid mosquitoes.
And he fought malaria, prepared the whole village to compete.
So how many Jamuna Mani will be.
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We'll look at them with a little respect.
Such people become the biggest strength of our country.
How do the happiness and misery of society become big companions
I salute all such ASA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to look at it.
See, not only this, please read it to others and maybe you would like to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
Discuss books and if an enthusiastic youngster goes to the schools of the neighborhood with these books and tells the children of class VIII, Ninth, Tenth class that this happened here.
So you can truly become a social teacher.
I invite you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is concerned about climate change.
It is also a matter of concern for climate change, global warming, dugger-dagger and it is getting approval as a standard before doing everything.
Earth's temperature should not increase anymore.
It's everyone's responsibility, it's also worrying.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, we should bathe in the full moonlight by closing the street lights.
The light of that moon should be experienced.
A friend had sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see it, so I felt like telling you this thing too.
I don't think of a woman television at Kanpur. Someone would have got the good fortune to read more.
But one such thing is being done which perhaps no one would have thought.
He is working to provide light to the poor using solar energy.
He is fighting a war with darkness and is illuminating his name.
She has formed a committee of women and has installed a plant of solar energy lanterns and provides lanterns for a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
It costs around Rs. 3-4 per day but there is light in the entire house and this Noorjahan continues to work day by day to recharge the lantern with solar energy in that plant.
Now see what the big people of the world would do for climate change, but a nook and corner may inspire everyone.
And anyway, Noorjahan means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I congratulate DEET as he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Many congratulations.
Thanks to Abhishek ji.
You sent me a message from Gorakhpur.
Prime Minister MRA scheme und the unfunded.
Those who do not get the money, they get the money.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got Rs. 42 thousand crores from the Pradhan Mantri MRAY scheme.
Whether it is a washerman or a barber or a seller or a seller of milk.
Small businessmen and I am glad that there are 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of the people who have received this help are SC, ST, B, people of this class who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told the story of his enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news.
Someone just told me that there is no Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
He received a loan of Rs. 8.
And they started the business of sewage dress, cleanliness.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosale did it.
They have brought a tanker, they are doing that work and I was told that in such a short time, they also returned the bank to 2 lakh rupees.
After all, this is the intention under our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Bhopal's Mamta Sharma that she received 40 thousand rupees from the bank from this Prime Minister MRA scheme.
She is working to make a wallet.
But earlier she used to bring more money to the business and it was very difficult to do business.
Now, due to the good amount of money coming together, he made his work better.
And earlier due to the extra interest and due to reasons, due to the excessive expenditure incurred on him these days, due to his coming into his hands, he started saving more than one thousand rupees per month.
And his family started developing a good business gradually.
But I would like to have more publicity of the scheme.
All our banks are more sensitive and help smaller people.
In fact, these people run the country's economy.
People who do small things are the economic power of the country's meaning.
We want to emphasize that.
It's good, but to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are things that should be consistently aware of the social life.
The national awareness campaign International Vigilance is the pride of liberty, the unity of the country should continue to do this ritual.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, I want to make it a scheme.
MyGov had asked for suggestions on him.
How are the structures of the programme
What are the people
How to increase public participation
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told that there are lots of suggestions.
But I expect more suggestions.
Some big priests have also been declared.
You should also apply your creative mind.
How can Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat make this mantra of unity integrity connecting every Indian
What kind of plan, what kind of program
Whether it is life-style or fantastic or life-style, it is easy to connect everyone.
What should the government do
What will Vivil Society do
There may be many things.
It's fun to wear clothes, but I will urge you to exercise.
I would urge you to use these good weather for some time or the other to keep the body fit.
And we should create an environment in the family itself, it should be a festival of the family, this should be done by getting together for an hour.
So if there is a good weather, then there will be a good habit.
Once again I have got the opportunity to connect with you all with Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India-South Africa is going to play the fifth ne-day match in Mumbai.
This is the series named Gandhi Mandela Series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all my players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of All India Radio Kannur Kendra.
Congratulations are to be given that when I started talking about mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I have to talk about Kerala once again today.
Girls from Saint Mary Opera-Primary School, Chittoor, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
One, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with their thumb impression, on a very big cloth.
He has sent me that picture of Mother India's map.
Earlier I was surprised why he made a map of India with his thumb impression.
But when I read his letter, I realized that he had given such a wonderful symbolic message.
These are the girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
They are also trying to make people aware in their area and their mission is Angadan.
They are running a mass awareness campaign for organ donation.
He has also staged drama in many places to spread the understanding of Angadan among the people.
Angadan became a trend and tendency.
These girls have written to me in a letter that you should appeal to the people about organ donation in your mind.
He says Angadan should make a festival.
These days, I also receive a lot of messages on phone calls.
Devesh of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyesight is needed.
On death in a road accident, the organ of the body can be donated.
There are also a lot of legal confusions.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a very good effort to speed up the paperwork by reducing it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the front line in the field of organ donation.
Several social institutions, several NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
In order to promote organ transplant, National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOT) has been established.
A 247 fillline 1800114770 service is also available.
And it has been said here that the joy of renouncing Ten Taekten Bhunjitha is very good in this mantra.
In the past, we had seen on TV that a poor constable, Hawker and his wife were diverted to GB Pant Hospital in Delhi.
And this wiver was brought from Lucknow to Delhi by special arrangements.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Angadan Mahadan
We must fulfill this feeling of Ten Takten Bhunjitha and we must emphasize this.
Dear countrymen, we just celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days we will also celebrate Deepawali.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi is also celebrated.
For the first time on the soil of India, such a massive scale is being organized.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
Africa is the largest conference of African countries outside of Africa.
India-Africa relations are deep.
The population of India is as much as the population of African countries.
And together, we are one-third of the world's population.
And it is said that millions of years ago, it was the same territory.
Later, these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of similarity between us.
And nearly 27 lakh people of India have settled in these countries for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural ties, diplomatic ties, but India plays a very important role in training the younger generation of African countries.
Human Resource Development, Hapacity Building have read more than 25,000 African students in India.
And today there are leaders of many African countries who have studied in India.
So how deep we have.
And from that point of view this summit is very important.
Generally, when there is a summit, the heads of different countries meet.
Similarly, a meeting of heads is going to be held in a Summit.
Look, it is our endeavor that these people should also meet.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the RD Ministry, has done a very good programme.
There was a programme for enhancing the participation of the children of all the Failed Schools of BSF, a Say Competition programme was organised, a programme for writing poems, a programme for enhancing their participation.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of school children wrote about India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition on Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace from Porbandar, Memorials of Mahatma Gandhi, Mobile Exhibition is reaching Delhi on 29th October from Porbandar.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, people of villages and villages saw it.
There were very good compositions in this competition.
I pay attention to a composition, I like it, so I want to tell you.
But we can clearly see the opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate the dignity, the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and the RD Ministry.
On August 15, I had proposed a proposal in connection with the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana last time.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Staying big in mind.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
In which these ideal villages are going on, the head of the village, the collector of that place, some MPs of that place, the Indo-Government, all the state governments together discussed the topic of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Under the influence of these leftist extremists, many areas of the area have been wasted.
However, our MPs are very senior, they have been deputy speakers in the Parliament, they have spent their lives for the tribals, Mr. Karia Munda ji.
He chose to make Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand an ideal village.
I congratulate the Honble MP Shri Karia Munda ji.
I got the same news from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself spent his life in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose the Kipadi Gram Panchayat for Adarsh Gram through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the system is underway but they have done a very special innovative job.
Mr. Ruwala ji started the Kurtiya Kut Sugarcane festival in the village on 11th March.
The people of all the areas united in it.
How can we make the village a centre of economic activity, how can we market the village's production
His effort to build a self-sufficient village along with an ideal village is truly a tribute to ShrimanRuwala ji.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be so that there is no talk of cleanliness
Savita Rai has sent me a message from Mumbai via a telephone, every year we clean our homes to prepare for Diwali.
We should keep this Diwali clean along with our homes and outside environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I want to remind you, my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media in particular has launched a massive campaign in our country and after Diwali, all the firecrackers were visible and they said that this is not right.
So your point is that we should do as much as we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today I would like to especially congratulate the media fraternity of India.
And I was also watching how many kinds of activities were going on.
How-how people are working themselves like a one-like forest mission for this.
How many places are there in our country that have been kept so clean.
All these things were exposed and I congratulated the commendable work of India TV Group at that time.
However, ever since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been launched, I have seen that T. Denadu from Andhra, Telangana and especially Mr. Ramuji Rao is very old but his enthusiasm is not less than a young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children of nearly 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is public places, stations, religious places, hospitals or parks, a big campaign of cleanliness has been started in many places.
Now these reports show the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat in itself.
ABP News has started this programme under the name of India and it has done the work of highlighting the awareness of cleanliness among the people and training the people of the country.
There are hundreds of channels, thousands of newspapers in our country, everybody, I am not able to take the names of all, because of the lack of time, but I have started this campaign.
And that is why Savita Rai Ji has suggested that today the entire country is considering this thing as its own and is taking it forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor Shriman Shanmuganathan, he has written a letter to me and by writing a chitti, he has mentioned me in the village of Mavalyannong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last several years, this village has taken a pledge of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he was awarded the Leanest Village of Asia.
This is what makes all of us confident that our country will definitely be clean.
And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say this thing with pride and pride that we have freed our Mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on 15th August that there are some things where corruption has gone home.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he does not know for anybody's recommendation. Does he have to face difficulties and how a group of brokers grabs money from him
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who conducts a thorough investigation of a person in a minute or two-minute interview.
And with this idea, I had announced that why not we should finish the interview of these small pottery jobs.
My dear young friends, I want to proudly say today that the government has completed the entire process and now there will be no interview for recruitment in the Group D, Group C and Group B posts of the Central Government.
1st January, 2016 will be implemented.
We will not interfere in the process where the process is underway, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
My best wishes to all young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
In a way, gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold has been considered as a medium of economic security.
The key to crisis time has been considered as gold.
Gold can be the economic wealth of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am glad that we are going to launch important schemes before the budget that we had promised, during the festival of Diwali and when Dhanteras and people specially buy gold on that day.
We have brought the Gold Monetization Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as if you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier kept in the gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep in the gold bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Say, our countrymen can now become a gold property or not
Whether gold can transform from Dead-Money into a living force or not
Just. That's what we have to do. You give me the support.
Do not keep gold in the house now.
Another thing is that in the sovereign gold bonds you dont have a gold bag in your hands.
So you'll get two and a half thousand rupees in return for that paper.
So we are starting this thing.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will surely put this security guarantee scheme in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold ueens.
Gold Coin with the Ashok Chakra, it took almost 70 years for freedom, but till now we have been using the Foreign Gold Coin or the Gold Bullion Bars have also been using it abroad.
Besides, the Gold Level of twenty grams will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October marks the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat
Remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of entire India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
Iron Man has introduced his strength.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but his dream of uniting India was his dream.
Geographically, he did. But the mantra of unity should be the medium of our thought, behaviour, expression.
Many sects, many sects, many dialects, many castes, many environments, our country full of diversity and this diversity is our beauty.
If this was not a diversity, perhaps we would not be able to do the beauty we are proud of.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity are the herbs of development.
Over the last several years, on 31st October, there are Run for Unity programmes in many corners of the country.
I have heard that this time too, its plans are being made around, people are enthusiastically preparing for the race for unity.
The race for unity is the race for development in the true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development race is also a race of unity.
Let us pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Push forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, now all of you will be engaged in the preparations for Diwali, there will be cleanliness in the house.
New things will be bought.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated differently in every corner of our country.
I convey my best wishes to you for the auspicious festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come to mind.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I have to visit Britain.
I'm very excited about my visit to Britain this time.
Government of India and state governments also give scholarships to such promising children who go abroad to study abroad, be it Dalits, tribals or backwards.
I believe that this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for him and it will become an inspiration for him to learn something in his life but later to live for the country, this message was given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that in my visit to Britain, I am particularly thrilled, the topics have been complicated for many years. And now you can imagine how much pleasure the people like me will be if that building becomes the property of 1. 25 billion Indians.
I will also get another opportunity in London, unveiling the statue of Lord Visvesvara.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Visvesvara had done for democracy and empowerment of women is a really learning aspect of the world.
The dedication of the Statue of Lord Visvesvara on the soil of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India used to think centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are related then the hearts of all the countrymen get thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Through the telephone, I keep getting your suggestions through MyGov.in.
There is also a discussion on All India Radio in your letters.
Calling government officials is discussed.
Some people write their problems and try to solve problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I have got the privilege of learning some languages but still there are so many languages that where did I learn
But still I am grateful to All India Radio that they broadcast the matter of this mind at 8 pm in the regional language of each state.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the thing is of my mind.
Last time I was completing one year and today we are entering the new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
Talk of mind, September 2015
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
On the other hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, both the Parliament and the child of this country should talk about cleanliness, what can be the good fortune of a bigger country than this.
Institutions of local Swaraj - be it Panchayats, Nagar Panchayats, Municipalities or Municipalities or States - all of us have to work on this movement, we have to move forward in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say in 2019.
And I was surprised that the entire girl, the entire Gita, is a daughter of a very poor family of the Sundarpur resident of Varanasi, she used to interpret it in English and used to define it in Hindi. I asked her father, she said, she was speaking from the age of five.
They said, we don't even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, only the Gita reads and does something
Once again, I got the opportunity to come amongst you, to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
In the far south, people are dyed, in the festival of Onam and tomorrow the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes related to social security for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, in a big way, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small suggestion that we should give this security scheme to our sisters on the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
So far, eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since the launch of the scheme.
And I was told that nearly half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider it auspicious sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a massive scale a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
ero balance had to be opened but the poor had saved, saved and deposited twenty thousand crore rupees by saving.
The mainstream of the economy is the banking sector and this system has also emphasized the scheme of banking friends to reach the poorest of the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
Now thousands of people have become entitled to overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And this belief that the poor can get money from the bank was also born.
Once again, I congratulate all the concerned and urge all the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts to not break the bond with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, now it's your job to hold it.
All our accounts should be active.
But in a very short span of time, the enlightened and my citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again went to Gujarat on the path of peace.
This is the path of peace, unity and brotherhood. And we have to walk on the path of development shoulder to shoulder.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I can tell the truth that the way in which I got the opportunity to hear their words, in a way a music is playing.
The choice of his words, his way of conversation, i.e. the generosity in the Sufi tradition, which is the rhythm of a music, all of them experienced me among these scholars.
I liked it very much.
Perhaps the world has become the most necessary to reach the true nature of Islam.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide, which will benefit mankind and also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any sect, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my good fortune.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are going to come to Bodh Gaya and are going to discuss global issues related to mankind, I have also been invited to it. And I am happy that those people have invited me to come to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodhgaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world. It is a very pleasant moment for me.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Once again I would like to particularly inform you about Mann Ki Baat.
I have already mentioned this subject in the matter of mind.
You must have heard me in Parliament, heard me in public meetings, heard in the matter of mind.
Once I have come to say this thing that the government's mind is open on the issue of dispute regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the benefit of the farmers. I have been saying this repeatedly.
This means that the situation before my government was formed has now been re-established.
But there was one thing incomplete in it and that was 13 such points which were to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought it in the Ordinance but the matter was also complicated due to these disputes.
Ordinance is going to end but this is going to directly benefit the farmers, we are implementing those 13 points, we are implementing them under the rules so that there is no loss to the farmers and there is no financial loss to the farmers. And that is why we are completing the 13 points that were left in the earlier law and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan are not our mantra - the welfare of the villages and the poor farmers.
I have to say one more thing that it was fifty years before the 1965 war and when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan Mantra too.
And it is very natural for all those martyrs to remember the Tricolor Flag of India, its pride and glory.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 65th War.
I bow down to the heroes.
And the events of such history continue to inspire us.
The way I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, it was a pleasant experience.
I had the opportunity to interact with the dignitaries of the country for hours.
They got the opportunity to listen, and I was glad that in the field of science, India is doing a very good job in many directions.
Our scientists are truly doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these amendments to the common man.
How to convert the principles into tools
How to add Lab to Land
We have to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that it was a very inspiring and educative for me.
And I saw how many young scientists were talking with excitement, how their dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said in Mann Ki Baat the last time that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities, there are many possibilities.
I keep coming many letters from citizens.
From Thane, Shriman Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
Emphasis has been laid on reforms in education sector.
I would especially like to tell my young friends that on 15th August I had asked the Red Fort that why this interview for lower level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also one of the reasons for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on 15th August that I want freedom from the convention of interview below one level.
I am glad that in such a short span of time, it has been 15 days but the government is moving at a rapid pace.
Issues are being sent and the decisions will be implemented very soon that small jobs will be left out due to the interview process.
The poor will not have to run for recommendation.
There will be no deployment, no corruption.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For the sake of health, especially the maternal and infant mortality rate, the All to Action has been contemplated in the land of 24 countries of the world.
This was the first time outside the US, this programme was held in another country.
And it is true that even today, nearly 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die every year at the time of childbirth and immediately after that.
This is worrisome and scary.
Well, the improvement is enough.
India has started to be appreciated internationally, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, tetanus in the death of mothers and infants was also liberated.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborn children.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue keeps on coming.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am talking about Clean India is directly linked to it.
We see advertising on TV but we don't pay attention.
Advertisement is published in the newspaper but our attention is not paid.
There are ways of maintaining cleanliness with pure water in small things in the house.
There is widespread public education in these things but we dont notice and sometimes we feel that we live in a very good house, we have a very good system and we do not know that we have water filled ourselves and sometimes we invite dengue.
I would urge all of you that we should not allow death to be so cheap.
Life is precious.
It is not okay that the indifference of water, the indifference of hygiene, these become the cause of death.
Free checking facilities are available for dengue at around 514 centers across the country.
From time to time, it is useful to save lives and your cooperation in it is very important.
And sanitation should be given a lot of importance.
These days, there are festivals in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why not add every festival to cleanliness now
You see that rituals will become a habit.
My dear countrymen, today I have to tell you a good news. I always say that now we will not get the good fortune to die for the country but we have got the good fortune to live for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
In America, Race Cross America is a cycle race, it is very difficult, it has a race of about 4,800 kilometers.
This year, these two brothers won this race.
See how everyone is making every effort to take the country forward.
And this is the case, when such incidents are heard, the chest gets strained.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to perception.
And the old generation always feels that the new generation doesnt understand anything and I believe that this process has been going on for centuries.
Experience in relation to my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth, we also get a lot to learn.
I have met several youngsters who say, "Brother, I have taken a fast in my life on Sunday.
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day in a week.
It's also good for my health.
And I also enjoy being a young man.
Nowadays, bicycles run in many cities in our country and there are many people who promote bicycles.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today when two youngsters of my country hoisted the flag in America, I like mentioning the direction in which the youth of India thinks.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
I enjoy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai - had been hanging for a long time to build a memorial for him.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand and inspiring memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which will continue to inspire us to work for the dalits, the victims, the exploited and the deprived.
But at the same time, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to live in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has also been purchased.
When the Indians travelling across the world will go to London, the memorial that Baba Saheb Ambedkar is going to build in the state of Maharashtra will become an inspiration for us.
I salute the Government of Maharashtra for their efforts in honouring Baba Saheb Ambedkar. I respect him and congratulate him.
My dear brothers and sisters, You must tell me your thoughts before the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, because I believe that democracy runs with public participation.
The country can move forward only by joining the shoulder.
My best wishes to you all.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely help in sowing kharif.
And a matter of happiness has come to my mind and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds pulses in our country.
The poor should have pulses, vegetables and so on.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters. I congratulate them.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The farmer's relationship with the country is equally similar to that of the country's youth.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was overwhelmed by hundreds of enemies.
I salute those brave soldiers who have failed their enemies, regardless of their lives.
The Kargil war was not fought on the borders only, it contributed to this war in every city, every village of India.
This war fought for those mothers, those sisters whose young sons or brothers were fighting against the enemies in Kargil.
Those daughters fought, with whose hands, Pehr's Mehndi had not landed.
And therefore, on Kargil Vijay Diwas today, I salute all these freedom fighters.
On 26th July, I consider it even more important because in a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we had launched MyGov on 26th July.
Our resolve to increase peoples participation in democracy, to connect the people with the work of development. And today, after one year, I am happy to say that nearly two crore people have seen MyGov.
It is heartening to note that more than 50 thousand people suggested on PM applications, they took out their time and made Mind Applications.
Now the matter is small, but no one in the government ever noticed this, nor was it ever thought of.
But the government seriously considered the suggestions of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, the people who are formed, the tag lines are formed, the programme is created, the policy is created, and there are very positive suggestions on MyGov.
A new Fresh Air experiences the governance system.
A new consciousness is experienced.
These days I have started getting suggestions on MyGov, what should I say on 15th August.
Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Daughter-son, speak on daughter-students, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this gave me an idea, what should I say on August 15 this time, can you send me suggestions
You can send a letter to MyGov, write a letter to All India Radio and write a letter to the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe that perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on 15th August should be suggested to the public.
I'm sure you'll send good suggestions.
One thing I want to express my concern.
I do not want to preach nor do I seek a way out of the responsibilities of the state government, central government or local Swaraj institutions.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver suffered for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people keep writing on this thing that you speak something on the road safety.
Be it Hoshakote Akshay of Bengaluru, Amay Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidari in Karnataka.
And when you look at the data, the heart shakes.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes due to road accident.
And it is also a matter of great concern that nearly one-third of those who die are young people in the age group of 15 to 25 years and one death shook the entire family.
The government must do whatever it wants, but I ask parents, whether it is a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler, the family must also focus on what is the issue of safety.
One more project is going to be expanded further, it is going to be expanded further, from there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangao and Mondia highways, it means, who will pay the first fifty hours or not, who will not give the money, who will not give up all these concerns and whoever is injured in the road accident, we are giving priority to the best possible service to him.
Toll-free 1033 numbers, ambulance system, all these things are available for providing information about the accidents across the country but all these things are done after accident.
We all are really dear to each other for not being accidental, we need to look at each other in the form of a life that is dear to each other.
Sometimes I say, become an employee.
In the last few days, some incidents have come to my notice, I felt good to talk to you, sometimes the person gets tired of doing a job, and for a few years things are fine, salaries are available, work is done.
I was glad to see this great example of how life can be brought about in our work.
Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art, his ability can be linked to his work.
Perhaps Vijay Biswal's painting will now be discussed in the coming days.
And one more thing came to my mind - the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, the entire group started a work that touched my heart and I liked it very much.
He started Operation Malaysia - Now someone will listen to it and there will be something else.
See how Rakshabandhan has changed. I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Sometimes these small things enjoy my heart, so I am sharing it with you.
There is a small village by haircut in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have tried to make toilets for the last few months.
And now no person in that village has to go to open defecation.
He did this, but when the entire work was completed, the entire village celebrated such a big festival as it is celebrated.
These excellent examples of how the values are changing in the life of the society, how the minds of the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, in connection with the North-East questions.
The people of Northeast, however, are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's a good thing.
But today I want to gladly tell them that there is a separate ministry for the Northeast.
They will go to the districts, they will go to the villages, they will meet the local government officials, talk to the people's representatives, talk to the citizens.
They will listen to the problems, they will do whatever the Government of India has to do to solve the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come by visiting, they also feel that how beautiful state, how good people, now they have to develop this area and they have to stay by solving their problems.
Returning with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very easy to understand the problems there.
So, a good effort, an effort to go from Delhi to the Far East, which I am calling Act East Policy, is the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all are proud of the fact that we enjoy the success of Mars Mission.
But sometimes these ideas also come to the fore, today if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to become next then one or half of the 100 students will be found who will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern that the trend towards science is low.
It is very important to take interest in innovation, to encourage them, to know their capabilities.
I would also like to tell the IAS officers of the government that if you have proceeded by writing so much, you should also go to a school-college near you for two to four hours a week and talk to the children.
Your experience and your strength will surely be of use to this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have started it and in the coming years, we will get 24 hours of electricity.
If the children of the village are to study in the days of the examination, then there will be no problem of electricity.
If small industries are to be set up in the village then electricity will be obtained.
Today, even if we have to charge mobile phones, we have to go to another village.
The benefits that the cities get should be met by the villages.
And that is why we have started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme.
I know that such a large country, lakhs of villages and villages have to reach far and wide.
But, for the poor only to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, I had a mind to talk about different things.
In a way, the month of August, the month of September, the festivals are celebrated in our country.
There are a lot of festivals.
My best wishes to all of you.
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your thoughts will be of great help to me.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had prayed to you people that if you go anywhere during the holidays and if there is a memorable picture there then an Incredible India will be inaugurated.
When I said, I did not think that such a tremendous result would be achieved.
Millions of people posted photos, Twitter Pay, Facebook Pay, Instagram.
I can say that we can see more than one scene, how much India is full of diversity.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the government of India has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big thing that you people have done.
And I was so impressed that I too re-tweeted it.
We will carry it forward, we will continue, the world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister but sometimes a person within me loses himself from all the other dignitaries.
21st June, International Day of Yoga, I can say that my mind was agitated in the same way as I had put this topic in the NCC.
We can claim that the sun never moves in the world of yoga practitioners.
The way the world has honoured Yoga by spreading its footsteps, the way the entire world has raised it on its shoulders, who will not be proud of it
The mind is overwhelmed.
And when the French people, for whom the Sean River and Field Tower are very glorious symbols, gave the place of equality to Yoga.
People in New York performed yoga on Times Sure.
If we talk about Australia, Sydney then the picture of Pera House comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time by placing Yoga in equal proportion to the pera House.
It is a matter of pride in itself whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Milan's uomo Cathedral.
Similarly, NPC-Kepping Force also performed well in the field of Yoga.
Even in India, our soldiers were performing yoga on Siachen, white snow sheets, and Yoga programmes were organized by the Navy in the sea, all around, wherever our naval ships were there.
Delhi has registered its position in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogpath.
I am grateful to the country and the world, and I can say that this was not a programme.
It seemed that every corner of the world had a new curiosity, a new joy, a new zeal and a new engagement.
A few days ago, when I had tweeted a photo on Twitter, a family from Vietnam with a small child, it was so lovely that it became so popular all over the world.
Everyone, be it old men or women or be it villages or be it developing countries or be it developing countries or be it developing countries or be it developing countries, everyone has joined.
Yoga has become a reason for connecting the world in the true sense.
But one thing I feel, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity towards India has increased.
The values here, the traditions here, the heritage here, the world wants to know.
It is our duty that we should share this legacy without logging the world and introduce it to the world.
But we will be able to introduce this only when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that what is new in our things, it seems like our family values, we do not know that India's family values are very big for the world.
I'm sure you'll be surprised.
There are a lot of things that our ancestors have given us and the world has the right to do what is best.
The success of International Day of Yoga has brought a new responsibility with joy and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give the best yoga teachers to the world.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from the world on one platform.
Institutions related to yoga should be introduced, knowledge of yoga gurus, information about yoga.
If you want to learn Yoga then you can learn where to get a Yoga teacher then you can prepare a database and I believe you can do it.
Let's start somewhere, this too will become a new power.
I have seen the events of the past few days from a more perspective, the government working, the government running, once the goal is fixed then we have seen the results.
And when there was despair all around, we should not forget that a year ago only one voice used to be heard from all sides, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government and sometimes no one pays attention to it.
In 2-5 years, if a very small news comes in the news papers, it will come in such a corner, it will be a small department, but it will lead the Yoga Day.
And the small departments of the world have done such a big job.
If the goal is in front, then it is a sample of how much small units work.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the victims of Yemen.
Within hours, the people of India reached Nepal to help them. When the government that was working to open Jan Dhan accounts in the bank, the people of all the banks came to the ground and in a short span of time crores of countrymen were connected to the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed for toilets in schools from the Red Fort and I had said that we have to complete this work by August 15.
The work that was not done in 60 years was a big bravery to invite about 4. 5 lakh toilets in a year but today I can say with satisfaction that it is a delay of 15th August but it has not been completed yet, however, people have completed the construction of toilets in almost every school.
That is, the government, the people, the government, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, we had launched three public safety schemes, I had done it from Calcutta.
There has been a very positive result in such a short time.
In India, very little work has been done in terms of public safety but due to these three schemes we are putting a big jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these public safety schemes but we have to move forward.
Rakshabandhan festival comes in August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a big gift.
Let us all strive together to fulfill this resolution.
When I talk of mind, many people send me suggestions too.
This time, I should say something for the monsoon, many people have sent such suggestions.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that for the monsoon, you must tell something in the matter of mind.
They have sent good suggestions.
You may also enjoy hot pakodas, bhajiyas, corn along with tea in the rain.
But the way the sun rays give life, the same rain gives strength to our lives.
The water of the village should remain in the village, the water of the city should remain in the city, it should be our resolution and efforts should be made to stop the water.
And rain water stops and if it returns to the ground and there is a recharge in the ground then problems of the year are solved.
I always tell the people that if you visit Porbandar in Gujarat, if you visit the house of Mahatma Gandhi then there is a tank in the geography inside his house, two hundred years old, wherein there was a system of direct rain water.
Porbandar is on the beach but sweet water was stored in the house by collecting rain water.
We can also do so.
All of us should be planting trees, planting trees during this rainy season through social organizations and youth in large quantities.
And I give a suggestion and I have a direct experience and a very successful experience.
This is my complete rural technology.
When you plant a sapling, plant an old soil pot in front of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill the water twice a month, it will also run.
I keep telling the farmers that instead of fencing on the edge of your farm, plant trees.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the rainy days, diseases spread very much with water.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria start growing and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
Insistence on drinking pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of cases we will care will be far from us.
Water should be there, rain should also be there but disease should also be avoided.
Friends, We have just launched three new schemes, especially for the urban masses.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities lively.
In the same way, there should be a country that can equalize the world.
There should be such a smart city in the country and on the other hand, the poorest of the poor should also have their own house to live in the country and the house should also have electricity, water, toilets and school arrangements to study nearby.
In 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of its independence, we want to give our countrymen a home.
We have started a big scheme with these three things.
I am confident that all these schemes will help in transforming urban life.
I myself am connected with you all through social media, I keep meeting you people and I keep getting good information about the government.
But sometimes even a person sitting in a remote village touches our hearts.
You know, a Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao program is going on from the government side.
But when a person, society, village becomes a part of the government's programme, how much increases its strength.
In the past, Shri Sunil Jaglan ji, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village in Haryana, took him a very interesting initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
The highest in Haryana.
But the Sarpanch of a small village of Haryana gives such a turning point to Beti Bachao Abhiyan, then it gives a lot of pleasure and a new hope is awakened.
That's why I express my happiness.
But this incident has inspired me and that is why I urge you too to post the seliwithdaughter along with your daughter.
You will write a tagline that will give strength to this idea, you will write a best line and it can be done in any language be it English or Hindi or your mother tongue or any language.
The very inspiring tagline I will retweet Selfie and your daughter.
In a way, we can convert this thing into a Jan Andolan to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.
Brother Sunil started the work from Bibipur village in Haryana and let us move forward together and I urge you people to post the selfiewithdaughter.
I wish you all the very best in this rain and enjoy the rains.
Make our country green.
You should continue the practice of Yoga, not for one day.
You see, you'll see the benefits.
Make it a part of your life, do it.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere, keep sending photographs.
The country and the world will know how much diversity our country has.
One thought that there was very little about handicraft in it.
We have to reach the world, we have to reach the features of India all around.
And we have a simple medium, we'll reach it.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
He used to listen, repeat and sometimes he used to become an inspiration for his own people, in a light atmosphere, in a family of 130 crore countrymen.
You can imagine how it must have been in the middle of the period.
Perhaps, it wasn't a lifeless program.
This programme had a livelihood, a feeling of affinity, a feeling of affinity, a feeling of affinity, and because of this, the time spent in the middle was very difficult for me.
I was missing something every minute and when I talk of mind, I may say, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, Purushartha is yours, Parakram is yours.
Feeling an emptiness
But this Sunday made a lot of wait
Well, I've got the chance
A lot of messages have been received in the last few months in which people said they were missing the matter of mind .
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to the world.
This is my vital voyage
My silent interaction with you for me was in a way a part of the experience of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath during the election crisis.
Most people have derived political meaning from it
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not say anything else today but I will certainly do that because of this compulsion of my mind, perhaps in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given the opportunity to fill up something.
The rest of your curiosity - I think I ' ll ever discuss it .
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, however, I am constantly feeling your efforts to emphasize a positive thing.
The letters and inputs that are received for Mann Ki Baat are completely different from the government functioning.
In a way your letter also becomes an inspiration for me and sometimes it becomes a cause for energy .
Sometimes some of your words do the job of shaping my thought process.
People present the challenges faced by the country and the society as well as the solutions.
If someone writes for hygiene , he is resentful of dirt , but also appreciates the efforts of sanitation .
If someone talks about the environment then he feels the pain, but at the same time he himself tells us the experiments he has seen and the imaginations that he has in his mind also depicts.
It tells us that there is no dearth of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
Needless to incorporate those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities, to implement them
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that all the 130 crore countrymen want to be connected with the strength and activity in the development of the country. And I must say this thing that I get so many letters in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls come in, so many messages are received, but the element of complaint is very low and someone has asked for something for himself.
When I analysis these things, you can imagine how much pleasure my heart will have, how much energy I will have.
You have brought me here, you have made me sit and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this feeling, let's go ahead with the talk of mind.
When there was an emergency in the country, its opposition was not confined to political circles, it was not confined to politicians, the movement was not limited to prison bars.
During the Emergency, every citizen of the country had started feeling that something had been snatched away.
Recently, the Mahaparv of Democracy, the massive election campaign, the rich and the poor in our country, all of them were happy to decide the future of our country in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance and its amazing facts also neglect it.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted, city one floor
This number may seem very normal to us but if I say in terms of the world that if we leave China then more people in India voted than the population of any country in the world.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double
The total number of voters in India is more than the total population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness and broadness of our democracy
2019 Lok Sabha Election was the worlds largest democratic election in history
You can imagine how much resources and manpower would have been required to complete such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees were forced to make the election possible by day and night
In order to successfully conclude this Mahayagya of Democracy, nearly 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces have fulfilled their responsibilities, 20 lakh policemen from different states also culminated in hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people , more than the last time polling took place .
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country for voting, more than 40 lakh EVMs (ME) machines, more than 17 lakh VVPATs (VVPATs) machines, you can imagine how big a jam
All this was done so as to ensure that no voter is deprived of his franchise
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, polling station was created for just one female voter
Polling station at the highest altitude in the world is also in India
The polling station is located at an altitude of 15000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is also another fact that is proud of this election.
Perhaps this is the first time in history that women have voted enthusiastically like men
Voting percentage of women and men was almost equal in this election.
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are 78 women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and bow down to the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from me several times, don't book, I was urging you to give books instead of flowers in reception.
Since then , a lot of people have started giving books
However, I could not find much time, but during my stay, I got an opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His stories encompass the whole of India .
When I was reading the story of his written drug addiction, my mind automatically went to the economic inequalities prevailing in the society.
The story of amindar's son Ishwari and the poor family's bir is learnt that if you are not careful then you do not know when the effect of bad company comes.
The second story, which touched my heart inside, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, such a mature feeling at such a young age.
When Hamid, 4-5, comes to his grandmother with a pinch from the fair, in fact, human sensitivity reaches its peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a very big truth of life, child Hamid played the part of old Hamid, old Amina, girl Amina.
One such poignant story is the night of Puss
This story saw a live depiction of the irony of a poor peasant life
Turmeric farmer is happy even after his crop is destroyed because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter .
Though these stories are almost a century ago, their relevance still feels the same.
After reading these, I had a different kind of feeling
When it comes to reading, in any media, I was reading about Kerala's Akshara Library
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated between the dense forests of Idukki .
The primary school teacher here PK Muralidharan and PV Chinnathampi running a small tea shop, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling in the clutches and putting them on the back
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
Wanche Gujarat campaign in Gujarat was a successful experiment
Millions of people of every age group participated in this campaign to read books
In today's digital world, in the time of Google Guru, I would urge you to take some time to place your book in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy a lot and write about all the books you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat will know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country are thinking about issues which are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModiApp and Mygov and I noticed that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Pawan Gaurai of Belgavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water is of great importance in our culture .
Give your blessings to the mother , and shower your grace upon us .
Lack of water affects many parts of the country every year
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received from rain in a year is saved in our country
I am sure, like other problems, we will also solve this crisis with the help of Jan Shakti, Jan Shakti and the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore Indians.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping paramount importance of water
This will enable faster decisions on all water related subjects
A few days ago , I tried to do something different
I wrote a letter to Sarpanchs across the country to the village head
I wrote to the Gram Pradhans that to save water, to accumulate water, to save rain-drop water, they should convene a meeting of Gram Sabha and discuss it with the villagers.
I am glad that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month millions of people performed shramdaan in thousands of panchayats.
People in villages resolved to accumulate one drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
Listen, Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Cuttackamsandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us a message. My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there, once again are ready to play their active role for water conservation
On behalf of me, I convey my best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, to all the Sarpanches and to all the Sarpanches for their activism.
There are many Sarpanches across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation
In a way, the entire village has become an opportunity.
It seems that the people of the village, now in their village, have gathered in the competition to build a water temple.
As I said, collective efforts can yield big positive results
There can be no single formula for dealing with water crisis all over the country .
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in different ways for this.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that is to save water, water conservation
Fixing drainage lines in Punjab
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging
The construction of the tank in Thimmaipalli (Thimaipalli) of Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, there has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields.
I was reading about a collective effort at Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag Nadhi.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on rainwater harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we are united and striving hard we can make the impossible possible.
When people will connect, water will survive
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I am making three requests to the countrymen.
My first request is to initiate a mass movement for water conservation just as the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement.
Together we should resolve to save every drop of water. And I believe that water is God's offerings, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier they used to say that iron becomes gold from the touch of mercury
I say, water is mercury and from mercury, by touch of water, a new life is created
Start an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Tell us about the problems related to water, as well as spread the ways to save water.
I especially urge people from different fields to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is in the film industry, in the field of sports, in the media, people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organisations, people who do tales and tales, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awaken the society, connect the society, join the society
You see, we will be able to see changes in front of our eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is that in our country many traditional methods are being used for water conservation for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar and the place of birth of revered Bapu then there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu, there is a water storage tank of 200 years old and there is water in it and there is a provision to stop rain water then I always used to say that whatever kirti temple goes to see the stalk of that water.
Let us connect with water conservation and motivate people to conserve water by making a list of more and more methods
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShakti hashtags
My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude for one more thing and also to express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, we celebrated Yoga Day once again with the zeal and enthusiasm that three-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day.
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come up for Holistic Health Care.
Everyone, in every corner of the world, if a yogic lover welcomes him as soon as the sun sets, then there is a complete journey of the sunset.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from air force to aircraft carriers, from A gyms to a heated desert, from villages to cities, Yoga was not only done everywhere, but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family
We all know that healthy and sensitive people are needed to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures that
Therefore, the propaganda of yoga is a great work of social service.
Should not he be honored by recognizing such a service
In 2019, the announcement of Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been given to organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roi of Italy who started Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in themselves .
If this is a topic related to yoga, can Indians stay behind
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honored and dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
It is a very important journey for me to connect with your thoughts.
Let us continue to meet, keep talking
Keep listening to your emotions, be conservative, keep understanding
Sometimes I try to live those feelings.
Be your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy the talk of mind and also play the responsibilities of life.
Once again next month we ' ll meet again for Mann Ki Baat
Thank you very much to me
This weather is also hot on one side, and it is also happily somewhere.
Talk of mind, April 2015
Mann Ki Baat, December 2014
And I have seen that there was not only a programme of government's evils but also anxiety and I believe that in a way there was a need to get out of the problem and due to this an atmosphere of good deliberations has started. The government's responsibilities have also been sensitized. They feel that they cannot remain indifferent.
Have you ever thought
Imagine
This is the money of drugs if they go to terrorists .
If terrorists buy arms from these money
And with the same weapons , a terrorist would stain the breasts of my country ' s soldiers .
The young man of my country would have been martyred
Have you ever imagined that the one who killed a mother, who was the mother of India, who had been shot in the chest of a soldier for the country
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their secular progress with our children
Modi ji, do not you get tired
A month is very long .
Many incidents happen in the country and the world .
All of you celebrated Diwali with zeal and enthusiasm .
Festivals are such that from time to time they keep enjoying their lives, be it the poor, the rich, the village or the city, everybody has a great significance in their lives.
Sometimes they think that people are useless, people don't have to do anything.
It is very important for me to change this thinking. Our country is not like this, the people of our country are not like this.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead, the governments are far behind.
And when I say with experience that perhaps even the governments need to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I see that these young people are committed to doing something or the other especially in India, they are looking for opportunities.
and doing it in its own way .
I had said last time, buy at least one Khadi cloth.
I didn ' t ask anyone to be Khadi , but I learnt from the Khadi stores that in a week , there was an increase in the sales of about 100 per cent hundred and twenty five per cent .
In a way , more than double khadi sales took place in a week from 2nd October as compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the people of India .
Cleanliness. One can imagine that cleanliness will become such a mass movement.
There are plenty of expectations, and should also be.
And I can see a good result, cleanliness is now being seen in two parts.
An old dirt, which is a mess of dirt, what will the people sitting in the government machinery do for it
It ' s a big challenge , but you can ' t run away from responsibility .
All governments, all municipalities, have to take steps for this responsibility as the pressure of the public is going to increase.
And the media is playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect which is very exciting, is enjoyable and satisfying the mind. The common man has started feeling that lets leave the earlier thing and will not do dirt anymore.
We ' re not going to do anything wrong with the new filth .
Someone from Satna, Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bharat Gupta has sent a mail to my MyGov.
He was going to visit his.Railway, he said his own experience. He said that I used to go to the railway earlier, this time also I went to the railway but I am seeing that every passenger in the railway. People keep eating and drinking in the railway, keep throwing paper and paper. Saw that no one throws, not only that, they used to find that there is a dustbin in the box, put garbage in it.
And when they saw that there was no such arrangement in the railways , they themselves collected their garbage in the corner .
He said it was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharat ji for bringing me this information .
But I see that the biggest impact is on small kids .
Hundreds of families discuss this thing that if our child still eats chocolates somewhere then he will immediately pick up the paper .
I just saw someone in a social media that someone had written. My hero of today and in my hero of today he had given a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone has started feeling that our country, we will not be dirty.
We don ' t justify dirt .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed, and soon somebody gets to touch them.
I consider this auspicious sign .
One good thing is that people who come to meet me these days, people from all walks of life meet me.
Somebody talks about cleanliness, somebody talks about education, somebody talks about social reform.
Someone is discussing the loss of our family life .
I think , otherwise , if such a businessman comes first , he will talk to the Government about his own selfishness .
But I see a major change .
They talk less about their selfishness, they talk about taking some or the other responsibility related to society.
These are the things that I see by adding, I am aware that we are moving in the direction of a very good change.
If a poor family of mine is not sick , there will never be an economic crisis in his life .
If he is healthy then he will work hard, earn, family will run.
And therefore, my cleanliness is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we are able to serve the poor better or not , we don ' t pollute , even if we don ' t do it , it is good for the poor .
Even then , I have seen that those who are working in this field are sending me their success stories .
But I came to know of two things from my Government .
After my saying that the officers of H . . . Ministries who are there of ours also felt that we should do something .
And the officers formed a plan together .
See how the change in government starts .
Once he decided that if he wants to go to the specialty abeld child then he has planned to give him a special scholarship after favouring such a thousand good specialty abeld children .
I compliment all the officers of the department for their ideas .
I had the opportunity to visit Siachen in the past .
I spent Diwali in the midst of the dying men .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because because of them, we are able to celebrate Diwali, so I went among them.
I have experienced how many difficulties they spend their lives.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say another pride .
The soldiers of our country work in the area of security .
During natural calamities by putting a stake in life anyone is ready to do any courage to save us .
I specially congratulate these jawans .
I had just got the opportunity that I had organised a tea programme from the youngsters, youngsters and the winners of sports.
I got a new energy .
I was seeing his enthusiasm and enthusiasm that our systems and facilities are very low compared to other countries, but instead of complaining, they were talking about doing something more with zeal and enthusiasm.
For me, the programme of tea and drink for these players was very inspiring.
On one hand, I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say it and it's my mind.
And I believe that the countrymen have faith in my words and have faith in my intentions.
But today , once again , I want to repeat it on my behalf .
As far as black money is concerned, Black Money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your Prime Servant, this is the Artificial of Fath for me.
The money that has gone out of the poor of India should be refunded. This is my commitment.
There can be differences of opinion in terms of ways and methods.
And democracy is natural , but I assure you that we are on the right path , on the basis of the understanding I have and the knowledge I have .
Today no one knows, I do not know, nor do the government know, nor do you know, nor the previous government knew how much money was left out.
Everyone keeps on telling different statistics in their own way.
I don't want to engage in those figures, my commitment is that it is two rupees, five rupees, crores, billions and billions, whatever is trillion, this is the money for the poor of the country and should come back.
And I assure you that there will be no dearth of my efforts .
Nobody will be allowed to do so .
Just keep me blessed.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do it, I will definitely do it.
I assure you of this .
I have received a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, even though I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this feeling.
He has told me that you must discuss this matter in your mind .
I agree with his suffering .
When I talk about the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely discuss this issue of drugs, these drugs, the drug mafia and the greatest crisis that India's youth can face.
If you have some experience in this regard, if you have some information, if you have saved the children who are addicted to this addiction, if some government servant has played a good role in protecting them, if you give me such information then I will talk to the countrymen about these good efforts and we will create an atmosphere in every family that we will definitely discuss this thing in detail.
I know that I am dealing with topics in which the Government comes first in the courtroom .
But how long will we hide things
I am also daring . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do so .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were asking us to give suggestions, give it on facebook, give it on Twitter, send e-mail.
But there are very large sections of the country, who don't have it, what do they do
Your point is correct .
Not everyone has this facility .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind then if you listen to me on the village-village radio then you will be able to reach me if you send a letter to Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio, Parliament Street, New Delhi.
And I ' ll take it seriously . Because the active citizen is the largest capital of development .
You write a letter, means you're very active.
For the sake of my mind, you should also connect with your mind.
Maybe you ' ll write a letter .
I will try, then talk to you next month.
My effort will be, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, I will do it at 11 a.m.
So I ' m going to be able to reach you .
Gradually the start of cold is happening .
There is a very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijayadashmi.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Vijayadashami.
I will try to talk to you twice a month or once a month.
Further, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk about it, it will be Sunday and the time will be 11 o'clock then you will also be convenient. And I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in conveying my thoughts to you.
Today, the festival of Vijayadashmi celebrates Vijayadashmi, this festival of Vijayadashmi is a festival of victory of good over evils.
But a gentleman of Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai, he sent a mail to me, he said that in Vijayadashmi we will resolve to eliminate ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to him for this suggestion.
Everyone must think that as a nation, let us resolve to rid ourselves of dirt on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami and attain victory by eliminating dirt, we can make this resolution on the occasion of Vijayadashami.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will clean themselves and upload their video to social media and they will invite nine more people.
When we talk of Mahatma Gandhi, the talk of Khadi comes in very natural meditation.
You know, our scientists successfully used to reach Mars in the least cost.
There is no shortage of our strength, only we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
Swami Vivekananda always used to say one thing that he always used to remember.
Once, the child who had gone with the lioness had grown up.
He said hey, what are you doing
You're a lion.
They made me bigger.
Look at my voice, look at my conversation.
So the lion said that let me show you who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and said to him with his own face - Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am also a lion, you are a lion and as soon as the self-esteem arose from within him, he got his own identity, he also started roaming like a lion, like a lion, the lion grew up among the sheep.
The essence within it has awakened.
Swami Vivekananda ji used to say this.
My countrymen, within 1. 25 billion Indians, there is immense power and immense potential.
We need to recognize ourselves.
There is a need to recognise the strength within us and then as Swami Vivekananda ji had said, we will be victorious if we move ahead with that self-esteem and accurate identity, our nation will be victorious and successful.
I spent two hours with him, perhaps it was a very emotional, inspiring event in my life.
God has probably liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the entire nation.
Later, I had become so emotionally touched that I used to do different Olympics for Specialty Abeld children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come, their parents used to come, I used to go there myself.
And that is why I liked Gautam Pal's suggestions that he has given me and I felt like sharing the suggestions that I have received with you.
A story gives me even more attention.
You knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we ourselves will not find even those who show the way.
We will not get to hold the finger and run.
We will have to start walking and I am confident that we are capable of walking 1. 25 billion dollars.
Many suggestions that come to me for a few days, big interesting suggestions are sent by people.
Some people have told me that when they start small industries, the process of registration of them should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for it.
Some people have written to me and sent them to teach children skill development from fifth grade.
Someone has written to me that there should be a dust bean within every hundred meters, if you have to arrange for cleanliness.
Some people have sent me by writing that polythene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I tell you from the front that if you send me a true incident anywhere, which is positive, which inspires me, inspires the countrymen, if you send me such true events with evidence then I will definitely convey the message of Mann Ki Baat to the countrymen.
Come, let us all work together to serve our Mother India.
We should take the country to new heights.
As it comes to mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came to my mind today.
I will meet at 11 a.m. but I believe that our journey will continue and your love will remain.
Even if you want to say something to me after listening to me, please convey it to me, I would like it.
I was very happy to talk to you all today and radio is such a simple medium that I will be able to reach far and wide.
I will reach out to the poorest of the poor, because the strength of my country is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers, sisters and youngsters, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
The country will move forward only by your trust.
I express my confidence.
You have faith in your power, so I have faith in the future of India.
The mind is filled today while starting talking about
10 days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons
These brave heroes, we sacrificed ourselves for the protection of 1. 25 billion Indians.
As the countrymen could sleep in peace, these brave sons had kept themselves together day and night.
In Pulwama terror attack, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, people across the country, and people have trauma and resentment.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have risen all around
I bow down to all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives, in the defense of Mother India.
We all have to forget all the differences of casteism, sectarianism, regionalism and others so that our steps against terror are more firm, stronger and decisive than ever before.
Our Armed Forces have always displayed unique courage and valour
In order to establish peace , where they have shown wonderful ability , the same attackers have also responded in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
Army has taken a pledge to destroy terrorists and their helpers
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational stories of their families that have emerged through the media have further strengthened the country's fraternity.
Ram Niranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, in this hour of grief, the zeal that has been shown in this hour of grief inspires us all.
They said , They will send their second son to fight against the enemies , and if need be , they will fight .
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena Ji, wife of martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He has also vowed to join his only son
When the body of martyr Vijay Shoren wrapped in a tricolor reached Gumla in Jharkhand , the innocent son said that I too would go to the army .
The zeal of this innocent person today expresses the feeling of children and children of India.
Similar feelings are being seen in the houses of our brave martyrs.
One of our brave martyrs is not an exception, his family is not an exception
Whether it is the family of martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six year old son of Martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would urge the younger generation to know and understand the zeal shown by these families.
For what is patriotism, sacrifice and penance, we will not need to go towards the old events of history.
These are living and awakening examples before our eyes and these are the reasons for inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that was waiting for us till such a long time of independence is going to end now.
The curiosity and curiosity of the countrymen is very natural about this.
On NarendraModiApp, Shri Omkar Shetty from Udupi, Karnataka expressed his happiness at the National War Memorial being prepared.
I was surprised and anguished that there was no National War Memorial in India.
A memorial where the heroic tales of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there must be such a monument in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, that is, on February 25, millions of our countrymen will hand over this national military memorial to our army.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
The heart of Delhi is that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present, just near it, a new monument has been constructed.
I am sure this will be like visiting a pilgrimage to a national military monument for the countrymen.
National Sainik Memorial symbolizes the nations gratitude to the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice after Independence
The design of the memorial showcases the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers
The concept of the National Soldier Memorial is focused on four concentration circles, where the journey from the birth of a soldier to martyrdom is depicted.
The flame of Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier
The second circle is the gallantry cycle that showcases the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
This is a gallery where the exploits of bravery of soldiers on the walls have been engraved
After this, the sacrifice cycle is demonstrating the sacrifices of soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in the golden letters .
After that the protector cycle displays security
This circle has a row of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and are giving messages to the citizens of the country assuring that every morning soldiers are stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Overall, the National Soldiers Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country for their gratitude and research.
Here is the story of the sacrifices that have sacrificed their lives for the country so that we can survive so that the country can be safe and developed .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces to the development of the country in words
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security .
I hope you will visit the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you visit, share your pictures on social media so that others get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this holy place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, for the sake of Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments keep getting me read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comment, I noticed a very interesting comment from Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda, then his age was only 25 years old. It is a coincidence that Jamshedji is also the birth anniversary of Tata on March 3.
And he further writes, These two personalities are entirely from two different family backgrounds that enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In Mann Ki Baat, Birsa Munda and Jamshedji are like bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand in a way to pay homage to Tata.
These two great personalities have enhanced the name of Jharkhand not the whole country
The whole country is grateful for their contribution .
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality for guidance, then that is Lord Birsa Munda
The British caught them secretly when they were asleep
Do you know why they resorted to such cowardly action
because even the British who built such a big empire were afraid of them
Lord Birsa Munda shook the British rule equipped with guns and guns only with his traditional arrows
Indeed, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people on the power of weapons is huge.
Lord Birsa Munda fought the British not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
They did all this in their little life .
In the dark life of the deprived and the exploited , the sun shines
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the age of 25
Mother India like Birsa Munda has been in every part of the country.
Perhaps there will be a corner of India that no one has contributed to this centuries-long freedom struggle.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize his existence then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave a big institution to the country.
Jamshedji Tata was truly a visionary who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is essential for the future.
Not only that, he also established many world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister Morarji Bhai Desai was born on 29th February.
As you all know , this day comes only once in four years
Wealthy, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
The record of presenting the highest budget in Parliament in independent India is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai.
Morarji Desai efficiently led India at a difficult time when there was a threat to the democratic fabric of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai throws himself into the movement against Emergency to protect democracy
For this he had to pay a heavy price even in his old age .
At that time the government arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his tenure, the 44th Constitutional Amendment was introduced.
This is important because the 42nd Amendment that was introduced during the emergency, in which there were other provisions to reduce the powers of the Supreme Court and those who violated our democratic values were returned.
Provision of publication of proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies in newspapers through 44th Amendment
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored. In this amendment, it was also made that the fundamental rights found under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be violated even during the Emergency.
For the first time such arrangements were made that the President will announce the Emergency only on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and it was also decided that the period of emergency can not be extended more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was killed in 1975 by imposing emergency, it could not be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in upholding the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity about the Padma Awards.
Today, we are moving towards a New India. In this we want to respect those who are doing their job at the grassroots level with utmost sincerity.
They are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways on the strength of their hard work.
Indeed, they are true Karmayogis, who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and above all in national service.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who it is .
In a way, I consider it a great success because these are people who are not on TV, magazine or ront page of newspapers.
They are far from the world of glare, but these are people who do not care about their names, just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : Karmasu Kaushalam has won the message of the Gita in a way .
I want to tell you about some of these people
You must have heard of Odisha's Daitari Nayak, he is not called the Hanal Man of the Disha, the Daitari Nayak cut the mountain with his hands and made it a canal for three kilometres. With his hard work, the problem of irrigation and water was eliminated forever.
Take Abdul Gafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job of reviving the traditional rogan paintings of Kutch.
They ' re doing a great job of bringing this rare painting to the new generation .
The Tree of Life art by Abdul Gafoor was gifted to former US President Barack Obama .
Among the recipients of the Padma Awards, Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata
This is unique in itself , as they spent their whole life in the service of gods .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and the exploited through the Kalanjium Movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated community based small financial system
Even at the age of 100, she is training yoga to people around the world and has so far made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, famously known as Lady Taran in Jharkhand, did the bold job of taking iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites. He not only saved 50 hectares of forests but also motivated ten thousand women to unite and protect trees and wildlife.
It is a tribute to Jamuna ji's hard work that today the villagers plant 10 trees on the birth of every child on the wedding of 18 trees and girl.
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration. It is difficult to get an example of the work done by him for the upliftment of Divyang women. By establishing an institution called Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, they are engaged in the pious work of making blind children self-reliant.
The story of farmer aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar i.e. Princess Devi is very inspiring
She has set an example for women empowerment and making farming profitable
Kisan Aunt linked 300 women in her area to Self Help Group and inspired them to become economically self-reliant.
He trained the women of the village in addition to farming and other means of employment. The special thing is that they have worked in connecting technology with farming and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time it has happened that 12 farmers have received Padma awards in the Padma awards given this year.
Normally , very few people associated with agriculture and very few direct farmers have come to the list of Padma Shris .
This in itself is a living picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, I want to talk to you today about a heart-touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Nowadays, wherever I am going in the country, it is my endeavor to meet some of the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY).
He was treated with this scheme and he became healthy, the head of the house, he became a victim of hard work and care for his family and was unable to work - he got the benefit of this scheme and he became healthy again, he started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big a change was taking place in the lives of the poor
If you all know any poor person who is unable to get treatment for want of money , tell him about the scheme .
Different education boards across the country will start the process for examination of boards of Class  and II in the next few weeks.
I extend my warm greetings to all the examining students, their parents and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a big event to discuss the examinations in Delhi was held at the Format of Town All.
One of the characteristics of the discussion on the examination was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination .
There are many aspects that can definitely be beneficial for the students .
All the students, their teachers, parents can see the recording of this entire programme on YouTube, so wish all my exam warriors the very best for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, it is not possible for India to talk about festivals.
There is hardly any day in our country that does not matter, which has no festival
Because we have this heritage of culture thousands of years old .
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, its special significance is filled in our temples.
They discussed many topics and their confidence was really influential - motivating .
During the interaction, when I was talking to an intelligent young man, he said, I am a stage artist, I mimicry in entertainment programmes. So I asked whom do you mimicry
So he told me that I mimicrify the Prime Minister
So I asked him to show it a bit and it was a pleasant surprise for me, so he did a mixture of the way I spoke in Mann Ki Baat, and he did a mixture of Mann Ki Baat.
I was very happy to hear that people not only listen to their minds but also remember them on many occasions .
I was really impressed by the power of that disabled young man .
My dear countrymen, joining you all through Mann Ki Baat programme has been a unique experience for me.
Through the radio , I ' m going to meet millions of families every month .
Sometimes I feel like you have taken me as a part of your family while talking to you, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on your phone.
It ' s a very pleasant feeling for me .
Friends, election is the biggest celebration of democracy
For the next two months, we will all be busy in the round-the-clock election.
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Respecting a healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, in the month of March, in the month of April and in the month of May, all these three months of our emotions will be filled with a new confidence after the election. With the strength of your blessings, once again I will start the series of our conversations through Mann Ki Baat and I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
Shri Sri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji of Shri Siddhaganga Monastery in Tumkur district of Karnataka has not been among us
Sivakumar Swamiji dedicates his entire life to the service of society
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us that Kayakav Kailas is like performing his duties while working hard, it is like being in the residence of Lord Shiva, Kailash Dham.
His fame was in the form of a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages
He was a social reformer
He dedicated his entire life to the fact that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
Be it the welfare of the farmers in every way, it was a priority in the life of Swami ji.
Siddhganga monastery regularly organises animal and agricultural fairs .
I have often got the privilege of receiving the blessings of the supreme revered Swami ji .
In 2007, on the occasion of the centenary year celebrations of Shri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji, our former President, Dr. A.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem to revered Swamiji on this occasion
This poem by Dr Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Sri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhganga Math in a beautiful way.
Once again, I offer my homage to such a great man.
ECI was the foundation day on 25th January, which is celebrated as National Voters Day, National Voters Day.
The people of the world are surprised to see the scale on which elections are held in India and it is natural for every countryman to be proud of the Election Commission after seeing the wonderful conduct of the Election Commission.
There is no excuse left in our country to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, has a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote
When you hear these things , it is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission .
Keeping in mind that one voter, that voter gets an opportunity to exercise his franchise, the entire team of EC staff goes to far-flung areas and arranges for voting - that is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the EC for its continued efforts to strengthen our democracy
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country this year, this will be the first time that youngsters born in the 21st century will exercise their vote in Lok Sabha elections.
There is an opportunity for them to take responsibility on their shoulders .
Now they are going to be part of the decision making process in the country
Time has come to connect our dreams with the dreams of our country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to vote.
It is my duty to vote together - these feelings should flourish within us
For any reason in life, if you can't vote, then there should be a lot of pain
Sometimes there should be grief if something goes wrong in the country
I urge the celebrities of the country to collectively educate the people about the issue of voter registration or voting on the day of polls.
I hope a large number of young voters will be registered and will further strengthen our democracy with their participation
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some amazing and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is polygamous
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You know that many such rooms, buildings were closed since independence inside the Red Fort.
Those closed Red Fort rooms have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and ICAI.
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history lies.
Things that tell the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the verge of the museum inspire us to go within history.
At this very place, the brave sons of Bharat Maa Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan were tried by the British.
When I was visiting the Red Fort, Kranti Mandir, the memories associated with Netaji, then the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap, cap.
Netaji used to wear the same cap
I kept the cap in the museum, so that the people coming there would see the cap and take inspiration from that patriotism.
Indeed , the valour and patriotism of its heroes need to be brought to the new generation in a different way .
Just a month ago on 30 December I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands .
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted right at the spot where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because it was the tradition on 15th August.
This was the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organiser
a brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle
Come to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the heart of every Indian with vibrant slogans.
For many years it has been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we have been able to do this thing.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family had come to the Prime Minister's residence
Together we talked a lot about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose .
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop many places associated with the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir connected with Baba Saheb Ambedkar
If you come to Delhi , you must visit these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connectivity with the people, similarly Netaji had a deep connection with the radio and he had chosen radio to interact with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto Urdu etc.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the general public and their programmes gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A visual art museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir .
Indian art and culture in a very attractive way has been attempted .
There are 4 historical exhibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works of three centuries old .
Excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloj Mukherjee have been exhibited in the museum.
And I would especially urge you to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
Now you might be wondering that this is a matter of art and I am talking to you about Gurudev Tagore ' s excellent work .
You have so far known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore didn ' t name most of his work
He believed that the person who saw his painting himself understood that painting, let the message given by him in the painting go from his perspective
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, in Russia and in the US
I hope you ' re going to see their paintings in the Kranti Mandir
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints
Our saints have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such saint was - Sant Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on February 19
The twins of Saint Ravidas ji are very famous
Saint Ravidas ji used to give greater messages through a few lines .
He had said that there is a caste in the caste, which can not be added to Ketan's feet, Radas Man, unless the kind of banana stem is split, then the leaf under the leaves and in the end nothing comes out, but the whole tree is over, in the same way man has been divided into castes and not a human being.
He used to say that if really God is in every human being, then it is not appropriate to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life through his messages.
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained the true meaning of labour prestige to the world .
He used to say , Ganga in Kathawati i . e . if your mind and heart are sacred , then God lives in your heart .
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced the people of every section, be it the kings of Chittor or the queens of Meerabai, all were his followers.
I once again bow down to Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight the aspects of Indias space programme and its future.
They also want me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think beyond the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Numerous young scientists of the country have contributed to our space programme.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching space.
The Kalam set created by our students on January 24 has been launched.
Sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made several records.
The number of space missions that have been launched since independence till 2014, almost the same space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously with the same spacecraft.
We will soon register India's presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign
Our country is also using space technology to protect livestock.
Whether it is cyclone or rail or road safety, space technology is getting a lot of help.
NAI devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers which are helpful in their safety as well as economic growth.
We are using space technology to further improve the delivery and accountability of government services
Housing for All means Housing for All. About 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been geo-tagged under this scheme.
Along with this, about three and a half crore properties were also geo-tagged under MNREGA.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It is a major contributor to our better relations with many countries of the world .
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has gifted development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through its highly competitive launch services, India today launches not only the developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries.
Skies and stars are always very attractive for children .
Our Space Programme gives children an opportunity to think big and move beyond the limits which were considered impossible so far.
This is a vision for our children to keep watching the stars and inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the players who have played, and this time in Khelo India, a lot of youngsters and young sportspersons have come forward.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports will be strengthened i. e.
This time, players from every state have performed well at their own level in Khelo India.
The life of many medal winners is a tremendous inspiration .
They live in a parking shed with their family
At the same time, the captain of the Under-21 Women's Kabaddi team of Maharashtra, Sonali Helvi is a resident of Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother promoted Sonali ' s skills .
It is often seen that daughters do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi
Despite this , Sonali chose Kabaddi and performed excellently .
Asansol's 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw is the youngest gold medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games
A farmer's daughter Akshata Baswani Kamati from Karnataka won gold medal in weightlifting
He gave credit to his father for his victory, his father is a farmer in Belgaum.
When we are talking about the creation of India then it is not only the resolution of youth power but also the New India.
These stories from Khelo India are telling us that the people of not only big cities are contributing in the construction of a New India but they also contribute a lot to the youth from small towns, villages and towns, youth and sporting talents.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of a lot of prestigious beauty contests.
But have you heard of the toilet polishing contest
More than 50 lakh toilets have also participated in this unique contest that lasted for almost a month .
The name of this unique contest is clean beautiful toilet
People are making their toilets clean and colourful, paintings and making them beautiful. You will get to see from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kutch to Kamrup on a clean beautiful toilet.
I invite all Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in my Panchayat
Share your clean beautiful toilet photo with MylatGhar on social media
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we had started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and free from open defecation.
India, in collaboration with the people of India, is moving towards becoming Open Defecation Free long before 2nd October, 2019 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The audience of Mann Ki Baat has also contributed a lot in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat. And that is why you are happy to share that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and six hundred districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and the Sanitation Coverage in rural India has crossed 98 and nearly 9 crore households have been provided toilets.
My dear brothers and sisters, the days of the exams are coming.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, wrote on MyGov that I should talk about exams and am arriors
Anshul ji, thank you for raising this issue
Yes, for many families the first part of the year is Ham Season.
Students, from their parents to teachers, all are busy in exams.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would surely like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat today, but you will be happy to know that I am going to interact with students from all over the country at 11 am on 29th January this time along with students, parents and teachers will also be part of this program.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this program
I will talk to my young friends about all the aspects related to the examinations, especially the stress free exam i. e.
I had requested the people to send inputs and videos for this.
And I ' m very happy that a large number of people on MyGov are sharing their views
I will certainly put some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall program
You must be part of this program. Through social media and Namo App, you can also see its live telext.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu
At 11 o'clock the whole country pays homage to the martyrs
Wherever we are, pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes
Remember the virtue of revered Bapu and to realise the dreams of revered Bapu, to build a New India, to fulfill his duties as a citizen with this resolution, let us move forward.
Successfully carry forward this visit of 2019
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
That ' s where he performed his steadfastness towards justice .
I would like to say today that one thing that touches my mind is that when we hear the matter of sitting with all the family members then it seems that the head of our family is sharing our own words with us when I heard this thing in detail and I was very satisfied that I am amongst you, I am amongst you, you have made me big, and in a way I will continue to come here again and again as a member of your family, I will continue to be associated with you, your happiness and sorrow, your aspirations, my aspirations, my ambitions and my ambitions.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
You will be pleased to know that this award for best policy making in this sector is like a scar in that area. Not only this, our Sikkim has won this award by overcoming 51 Nominated Politics of 25 countries and I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this. My dear countrymen, this is the end of October. There is a lot of change in the weather too.
