Mann Ki Baat on October 2019
My dear countrymen, greet you.
Today is Diwali's holy day.
Nowadays Diwali is being celebrated in many countries of the world.
The unique feature of this festival is that not only the Indian community but also the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organisations there celebrate Diwali with immense joy and joy.
Thus, a microcosm of India is being displayed there.
Friends, Tourist Festival in the world is an attraction for tourism.
In our country, every region has its own diverse festivals and people of other countries have a special interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something different for this Diwali in Mann Ki Baat.
I had said - Come, let us together celebrate Diwali this time, the strength and achievements of India, that is, the honor of Laxmi of India.
Look, there were numerous inspiring stories in the social media.
Writing on Namo App in Warangal, my mother is my power.
My mother took charge of five children when my father died in 1990.
Today we have five brothers in good work.
My blessings to your mother, Mr. Nazi.
Geetika Swami, who is activated in 1992, says that Major Kushboo Kanwar, who led the Assam Rifles portfolio of the bus conductor, is Bharat Lakshmi.
Kavita Tiwari has her daughter Bharat Lakshmi and her own strength.
She's very proud that her daughter is a great painter.
The girl got a good rank in the CAT exam.
On the other hand, Megha Jain has been writing about an old 92-year-old man who has been distributing free drinking water at Gwalior Railway Station for years.
Megha ji, the humility and compassion of this Bharat Lakshmi is very inspiring.
People shared a lot of stories like this.
You must read, inspire, share your things like this...
The emotion of that poem presents a sense that its words are now written about what we say in the 17th century.
What great words, how great emotions, how good thoughts are in this poem in Kannada language
Pinnida Parmegondan is the birthplace of a human being like a goddess of the Himalayas, like a goddess of the Himalayas... because of his daughter Parvati, the king of the Himalayas became famous because of his daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride.
It is because of the glory of these women that our society has a strong personality and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I can never forget that I went to the gurudwara of Vancouver and Tehran.
I have many things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev who can share with you but it will require several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stood firm against many evils like torture.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji brought his message far away from the world.
He was the most travelling man at that time.
Going to many places, the simplicity, humility and behavior of the ordinary people shook everyone's heart.
The great religious journey of Guru Nanak Devji is called Udasi .
With a message of harmony and equality, he went north, south, east and west, and visited people, monks and sages everywhere.
Sant Shankar Dev, a well-known saint of Assam, is believed to have inspired him.
Rajgir and Gaya, associated with Buddhism, went to places of worship.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India.
Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water in Karnataka on his journey to Bidar.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji .
During such a journey Guru Nanak ji had travelled in Kashmir and surroundings of North India.
This established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji had also visited Tibet and the people there considered him a Guru.
He is also venerable in Uzbekistan.
As part of his visit, he has also visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He holds a place in the minds of millions of people, and follows his advice with due respect and obeys him even today.
A few days ago, diplomatic delegates from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which marked the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
The diplomatic delegates visited the Golden Temple and also had the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After that, many Ambassadors shared the pictures in the social media and wrote about the good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure all of you will remember October 31.
It was the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the steel man of India, who was engaged in the unity of this country.
Sardar Patel had the amazing ability to unite the people, and was also in harmony with those who had emotionally discriminated.
Sardar Patel had seen and studied every small thing in depth.
He was a personality of analysis in the true sense.
It was accompanied by excellence in organizational capacity.
He gained expertise in planning and enhancing war strategy.
While reading and listening to Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, we can see how deep his preparations were.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country had come to attend the Congress General Meeting in Ahmedabad in 1921.
It was the responsibility of Patelji to make all arrangements related to the Mahasammelan.
He offered this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
He ensured that no one had any trouble in the water.
He talked to the farmers and asked them to make Khadi bags.
The farmers made bags and sold them to the representatives.
The delegates didn't fear stealing shoes because they kept shoes in these bags.
On the other hand, Khadi sales have also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution.
He did a great deal of ensuring fundamental rights, so that there was no possibility of any kind of discrimination based on caste.
Friends, we are aware that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the gracious effort of uniting the nations, had done the work of bringing history to an end.
It was Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty to take a look at everything.
After the partition of India in 1947, our neighbour's eyes fell on the island of Lakshadweep and they shipped it with the flag of that country.
Immediately after this, Sardar Patel, without losing any time, has initiated drastic action.
He directed the brothers from Arcot Ramswamy, Arcot Laxmanaswamy to reach Lakshadweep along with the brothers from Thrissur and to raise the Tricolour Flag on Lakshadweep and wished to fly the Tricolour Flag first on Lakshadweep.
Soon there was a tri-flag fluttering and the land was devastated by the neighbour's dream of capturing Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel instructed the brothers and sisters of Lakshadweep to ensure that all necessary assistance is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the development of India.
This is a very attractive tourist spot .
I hope all of you will visit these beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, I had dedicated the Statue of Unity to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Patel.
It's the tallest statue in the world.
For the Statue of Liberty in America doubled.
Every Indian is proud of the tallest statue in the world.
The heads of every Indian rise with pride.
You will be happy to see the Statue of Unity in more than 26 lakh visitors within a year.
I am sure the people there are now starting the farming of dragon fruits, which will become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a learning subject.
We are witness to how a place has developed into a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There people come from all over the country and abroad.
Travel facilities, accommodations, guides, environment friendly arrangements are developing on their own.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, What Indian would be proud of the fact that Time Magazine has given the Statue of Unity a great place among the top 100 tourist destinations of the world
I'm expecting you to leave your precious time to see the Statue of Unity.
However, my request to all Indians who have taken time to travel should go to at least 15 tourist places with family and stay at night on their way.
Friends, As you are aware, every year since October 31, 2014, we are celebrating the Day of Political Unity.
On this day, we have a message of saving our country's unity, integrity and security at all costs.
On 31st October, 2018, the Raksha Mantri for Unity is being organised every time.
It will be attended by people from all walks of life, from all walks of life.
A symbol of the fact that this country is one, the Radio for Unity is going in the same direction and seeking the same goal.
Likewise, in recent times, there is a special interest and zeal in the cause of mortality.
The mobile phone unit is also a nice opportunity for that.
Running is beneficial for mind, mind and body.
That is why not only the body but also the mind, the unity of cultural India, and of bringing India to new heights...
So, in any city you live in, you can find out where the service for units are going.
I hope that all of you will be running for Indias unity and your fitness on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel insisted on unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious in strengthening the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around, we will find many examples of our persistent efforts to enhance mutual harmony.
However, often, the problems of the society, its contributions, and its memories go away quickly.
A lot of people in many ways went to the ground.
All the parties were playing games to gain their own advantage from the situation.
What kind of language it speaks to warm the atmosphere
Efforts have been made to shine in different voices.
We remember what some lecturers and some narrators have said to themselves to glorify themselves, and how irresponsible things have been said.
Appreciating the court's rise with pride, he did not allow anywhere to create an atmosphere of warmth and pressure.
These things have to be remembered forever, which gives us immense strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of duty.
This is an example of how the voice of unity gives strength to the nation.
It was a big blow to the country.
I pay my homage to the lady today.
My dear countrymen, if you hear a story of a house far away, if you can hear a story from every village, from north to south, from east to west, if you hear a story in every corner of India then it is about cleanliness.
I inspire every individual, every family and every village to share their own comfortable experience of cleanliness because this effort towards cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
125 crore Indians are the heirs of its outcome.
But it's also a comfortable, attractive experience.
I'd like to hear you too.
The world's highest battlefield, the temperature is 50-60 degrees minus.
The air contains only oxygen names.
In such a negative situation, it is a great adventure to live in the midst of such challenges.
In such a very opposite environment, our brave soldiers are not only waiting for our borders but they also have a programme called Swachh Siachen.
We know that these Siachen icebergs are the source of rivers and water.
Therefore, undertaking a cleanliness drive here, it means ensuring fresh water to those living in the valleys and they use water in rivers like Nubra, Shyok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is an occasion to awaken the spirit of all of us.
Deepali is especially buying something new and bringing something from the market.
I once told you to try to buy local goods.
If we get the things we need in our village, we don't have to go to Taluk.
If you get to Taluk, you don't have to go to the district.
As much as we try to buy local goods, Gandhi 150 himself will become a great opportunity.
We have to buy something that our weavers have worn with the hands of our weavers and our Khadi weavers shaped.
I urge you to buy local items along with the best wishes of Diwali.
Look, we can see how important we can play to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes due to neglect, there is a fire.
There might be burns.
I appeal to all of you to regulate yourself and celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.
Many good wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There will not be an Indian who does not feel proud of the soldiers of our armed forces.
Every Indian will always be enthusiastic to express his happiness and support to our soldiers, whether in any region or in any caste or language.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion people of India celebrated the day of the valour of our armed forces with pride.
We recalled the surgical strike in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to those who were arrogantly proud of terrorism in the face of our nation.
Our Armed Forces Exhibitions were organised in different parts of the country with the hope that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, should know what our strengths are.
We wanted to know through how capable we are and how our soldiers are saving their lives and saving the lives of people.
Days like Parakram Parv remind the youngsters about the pride of our Armed Forces.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the nation.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
Our army is sure to retaliate against those who try to dismantle the atmosphere of peace in our country.
India has always stood with commitment and dedication to peace.
In the twenty-first century, in the two world wars, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace.
And remember that we had nothing to do with that war.
It was an attack by our soldiers for peace.
India is still one of the largest armed forces in the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in ensuring peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things in the sky are different.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who are serving the nation.
When the attackers from Pakistan launched a sudden attack in 1947, it was the Air Force that ensured that Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield on time to rescue Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
No one knows about the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence.
The role of the Air Force is simple in liberating Kargil from the clutches of the invaders in 1999.
At Tiger Hill, an enemy base was bombed by night and the air force dumped them.
I am grateful to the Air Force for the commendable work done by our Air Force personnel, whether it is a disaster relief operation or a disaster relief mission.
India can proudly say that in the Indian Army, the Armed Forces not only contribute to manpower but also to women power.
Worried about how to save Tommy, even in the country.
You know Abhilash Tommy is a brave hero.
He is the first Indian to be in the world with a small boat without the help of a single modern technology.
For the past 80 days, he has been on his way to the ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but he was threatened by the terrible ocean.
But this hero of the Indian Navy has been fighting the sea for several days.
He lived in the middle of the ocean without eating and drinking.
I'm not ready to agree to failure to life.
A wonderful example of courage, determination and bravery - when Abhilash was saved from the sea, I spoke on telephone.
His courage, heroism, determination and the power to overcome evil and succeed will certainly inspire our younger generation.
My dear countrymen, everyone knows what is the significance of October 2 for our nation.
On 2nd October this year, we have a special significance.
From now onwards, for two years, we are going to organize various events across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis thoughts have inspired the entire world.
Later, in 1945, when the Freedom Struggle was strengthened, he re-discussed these thoughts and prepared a new edition.
His thoughts on the rights of venerated Bapu farmers, villages and labourers, and on many issues such as cleanliness and education, have been put forward in front of the people.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
The venerable Bapu was a mass organiser.
It was his characteristic that connecting people and bringing them together was his nature.
This has been experienced by everyone as one of his greatest personalities.
He convinced each individual that the person is the greatest and most ever needed person in the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle was to make it a mass movement.
People from all walks of life and all walks of life devoted themselves to the call of Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle.
In that, Gandhiji says, I am giving you a mantra.
You'll feel that your doubts are dishonest, and you'll feel that you're arrogant.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is equally great even today.
Today, we have to think of one thing on the basis of the growing middle class in the country, their growing economic strength and growing dynamics.
Can you remember the venerable Bapu for a moment when we go to buy something
Can you remember the venerable father's spell
Can you imagine which citizen of the country will benefit from my purchase
Whose face will be happy
Who will be directly or indirectly benefited by your purchase
I am very happy that the poorest of the poor will benefit.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I am confident that a small step of yours will bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest and the weakest.
My dear countrymen, perhaps he didn't even know how Gandhiji had said that cleaning the premises would lead to freedom.
But it happened, India got freedom.
Similarly, we can see how our country has contributed significantly to the economic growth and economic empowerment of the country by doing small things.
But I believe that if I can do that, that would be the true patriotism of today's era.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri kept the old and ripe clothes of Khadi as well as somebody's handkerchief is hidden.
He used to say that these Khadi cloths are very productive and every single piece of it should be utilized.
This feeling of tea and affection for the people of the country was filled with every corner of a small and lengthless gentleman.
After two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientist along with Pooja Bapu.
As soon as the name of the scientist comes, the Indians will have a lot of respect in their hearts.
His gentle personality is always a matter of pride for the people.
Besides, he might have been extremely humble, but he had a steadfast personality like a mountain.
His passing away is a reflection of his remarkable personality.
In a short span of about one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the jawans and farmers of the country to scale the heights of success as a reflection of his selfless penance towards the nation.
All over the country, people from all walks of life are associated with this fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-fifteen-day slaughter.
If you were not connected to this topic then people associated with cleanliness would not have noticed such a heart-wrenching thing.
I would like to thank you very much for phone calls.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will begin with the commencement of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu on 2nd October, 2018.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit: 'Desirectly, Self-Governance.'
In the Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, on October 12, 1993, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).
A few days later, the Commission is completing 25 years of its existence.
The Human Rights Commission not only preserved human rights but also enhanced human dignity.
Our beloved leader Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, has clearly stated that humanity is not a imagination for us.
In this 25-year journey, this institution has created an ideal and trustworthy atmosphere among the people.
I think this is a very impossible event for the best democratic values for a healthy society.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been set up in 26 states along with the national level human rights activities.
As a society, we need to understand human rights and bring them into action, this is the basis of SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas and SabkaVikas, the foundation of SabkaVikas, SabkaVikas.
My dear countrymen, while the birthday of Jaiprakash Narayan is coming in the month of October, can we not remember the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijayraj Sindhya
These great personalities are very inspiring for us and we salute them.
I am reminded of the fact that on 31st October, Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary will be celebrated in detail in the next Manki Baat, but for a few years, on 31st October, the 'Run for Unity' competition is being held in all the small towns, villages and streets of Hindustan, in the name of 'Run for Unity'.
This year, we have to organize Run for Units in our villages, streets, cities and cities.
The race for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
On 31st October, we have to focus on our efforts to bring together all sections of the society and all the components of the country in the framework of unity through the Rail for Unity Programme.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, Rakshabandhan is being celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to all the people on this auspicious occasion.
Rakshabandhan is regarded as a symbol of mutual love and trust among sisters and brothers.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are numerous stories enshrined in the framework of faith in the people of two different countries and religions.
The festival of Janmashtami has been going on in a few days.
Greetings to all people on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, on the occasion of Shravan Purnima, Sanskrit Day is celebrated.
I congratulate all those who have been associated with this great legacy and to reach out to the common people.
We are very proud that Tamil is the oldest language in the world and since Vedic times, Sanskrit language has played a very big role in the propaganda of knowledge.
You will be happy to know that residents of Matur village in Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking in each other's Sanskrit language.
So, in any microscopic sense or subject, it can be explained exactly.
It is also easy to understand because it is related to our soil and our traditions.
For example, to highlight the significance of the Guru in life, one alphabet Guruh Shishyam Prabodhitvathivam Nasti Tattvam, Yad-Dathwahayana Nrini Bhavet.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has saluted Radhakrishnan on the occasion of Sarva Palace.
His birth anniversary is celebrated throughout the country as Teachers Day.
I extend my greetings and good wishes to all teachers of the country on the occasion of Teachers Day.
At the same time, I appreciate your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the season comes with new hopes for our hardworking farmers.
Rainfall provides relief to boiling plants, trees and dry reservoirs in the scorching heat.
But sometimes a terrible and devastating flood comes along.
Nature has reached a stage where it is raining more than at one place.
We have already seen that the severe floods in Kerala have affected the lives of people in a very serious manner.
Today, in this difficult hour, the entire country is with Kerala.
We have sympathy with those who lost their own.
I would like to assure the families of the distressed that even though the lives of those who have lost their lives cannot be remedied, the 125 crore Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder in this hour of grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural disaster recover at the earliest.
I firmly believe that Kerala will emerge due to the courage and bravery of the people.
Damages to accidents are unfortunate.
But we can see a lot of vision of humanity at the time of danger.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something in their own way, wherever there is an accident, whether it is in Kerala or in any other state of Hindustan or district or region, to bring life back to normalcy.
All age groups and all sections of the working class are playing their own role.
Everyone is ensuring that the sufferings of the people of Kerala are minimized and shared with them.
We are aware that the Armed Forces personnel are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save the flood victims.
My dear countrymen, this time Mann Ki Baat was examining the suggestions received.
The issue written by more and more people across the country was our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Gaziaabad, Swati from Sonipat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swap Banerjee from West Bengal, Ashish Pandey from Katihar in Bihar and so many others have written to the Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov asking for various stories of Ataljis life.
On August 16, the country and the world were in pain when Atal ji died.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his twenty-fourth interaction through PRAGATI.
In a way, he has been away from active politics for the past 10 years.
There was no place in the news, no appearance in public life.
The 10-year gap is very big, but after August 16, the country and the world saw that the ten-year period in the minds of ordinary people of India did not last for a minute.
Whatever kind of love and respect Atal ji had, however sad it spread throughout the country, it shows his immense personality.
India will remain indebted to Atalji for the 9th Amendment to the Constitution in 2003.
This transformation has made two major changes in Indian politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinets in the States has been fixed at 15 of the total number of seats.
Secondly, the limit prescribed under the Prevention of malpractices Act changed from one in three to two.
At the same time, clear guidelines have been set to disqualify those who are changing the party.
Over the years, a political culture has emerged in the form of a giant cabinet in India, which was designed by big cabinets not only to divide the departments but also to please the political leaders.
Atalji changed it.
His move awaited money and resources.
And more efficiency.
This transformation has led to a vision of a person like Atal ji and our political culture and healthy habits have grown.
Atalji was a patriot.
The timing of presenting the budget was changed during his tenure.
Earlier, the budget was presented at 5 PM, following the traditions of the British, because it was time for Parliament to start in England.
During the presentation of the Atal ji Budget in 2001, it was changed from 5 PM to 11 PM.
One more freedom - during the reign of Atal ji, the Indian Flag Code was created and authorized in 2002.
Departments were also inducted to enable the National Flag to fly in public places.
It's a good thing, it's a good sign for democracy.
It will be a great tribute to Atal ji for enhancing good habits for a healthy democracy, for a good democracy, for consistent efforts to strengthen democracy, and for taking forward the discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a developed and prosperous India, I pay tributes to Atal ji for all.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded a few days ago.
You will be happy to note that the productivity of Lok Sabha is 118 and Rajya Sabha is 74.
The Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and 14 bills of Rajya Sabha as a result of all Members trying to make the Monsoon Session more effective than the party's interest.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered as a session of social justice and well-being for the youth.
During the Conference, important Bills for Youth and Backward Classes were passed.
Over the decades, the need for the OBC Commission to be formed like the Scheduled Tribes Commission was rising.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has achieved this time the decision to set up the OBC Commission and gave it constitutional authority.
The move will become one of the goals of social justice.
The Amendment Bill, 2019 to seek the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, was also passed in this Session.
The Act provides for greater protection to the well-being of Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent criminals from committing aggressions and enhance confidence in the community.
No civilized and injustice society will tolerate any injustice against women power in the country.
The country is not ready to tolerate the perpetrators of rape.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Penal Code Amendment Bill and ensured strict punishment.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago that a person who raped an adult child was sentenced to death by a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh after a two-month trial.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
The court of Rajasthan also took such a decision very quickly.
The Act will play a pivotal role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
I would like to assure the Muslim women that the entire nation stands with full force to provide them justice.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Parliamentarians of the country on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, the focus of millions of people is now on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning, people first search for social media in newspapers, television and news, which Indian sportsperson has won.
The Asian Games are still on.
My best wishes to all the medal winners for the country.
Among those who have won medals for the country, we have a lot of girls and this is a very positive sign.
Young sportspersons who have won medals are 15-16 years old.
The medal winning sportspersons are a good indicator of the fact that most of them live in small streets and villages, through hard work.
I once again congratulate the medal winners of the Asian Games and wish the rest of the sportspersons a good presentation.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Hello, Bhavnaji, I respect the child's views.
We have seen all of us constructing stones, wooden houses and buildings, but can you imagine the construction of an excellent, large and wonderful temple on a mountain that was about 1200 years ago on a single rock
However, the Brihadeshwar Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu is such a place where this incredible combination of architecture and engineering can be seen.
A well-known stadium named Rani ki Vau, built in the eleventh century at Pan in Gujarat, will surprise anyone.
India's land was an engineering laboratory.
He was the Bharat Bharat Bharatna Dr.
M.
He is venerable in that part of the country and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and loyalty.
In his memory, the 15th September is being celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have displayed their distinct personality all over the world.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers' Day, we will have to think about the future too.
There must be workshops.
Recently, Disaster Management has become a big issue.
The world is facing natural calamities.
In this situation, what form should the structural engineering be
How can we determine the priorities of construction without waste
We have to think when we celebrate Engineering Day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Due to India's geography and diversity, sometimes rain shows fondness.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
The team of 12 football players from Thailand were taken to the cave while their coach was landing.
It takes hours to get in and out of the cave.
Because they didn't find any other way, they searched for refuge on a small rock inside the cave - that's not a day or two, but a day or two.
If the kids see death in front of them, you can imagine what the minute will be when they have to live with them every moment.
On the one hand, they were facing an accident, on the other hand, the human values of the entire world were being manifested together.
People all over the world were praying to get these children out safely.
But in the end, when good news came, the world was calm and happy.
But I feel like seeing this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in the mission as a team.
I think it's important to learn and understand the behaviour of everyone.
In this initiative, a young soldier from Thailand's Navy had to sacrifice his life.
It is a wonder for the world that despite such a difficult situation, they did not give up hope in a water-filled dark cave with so much courage and patience.
This shows that miracles happen when humanity combines.
It was a special feature of the poems of Neeraj ji that shouted hope, faith, determination and confidence.
The words of Neeraj ji will be very powerful and inspiring for the Indians.
It has to be dark.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid tributes to Dr.
Namaste Prime Minister, my name is Truth.
I have been admissible as a first year student at Delhi University this year.
During our school board exams, you talked about the stress and education of the exams and what is your message to students like me
The month of July and August is very important for the farmers as well as for the youth.
Because it's called the peak season of the windows.
It's time for millions of youngsters like Truth to leave school and go to colleges.
In February and March, if the exam papers, answers etc. go, it is time to play the holidays of April and wait for the results and decide the way forward in life and choose a career.
Children come from the shade of their parents to the shade of professors.
I firmly believe that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy since the beginning of their life.
For the first time, you have to go out of the house and go out of the village and get out of a safe environment and be regulated.
So many youngsters leave their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students may have joined their colleges and some may be willing to join.
I want to tell you to be calm, enjoy life and enjoy the joy of the inner soul in life.
There's no choice but to learn, but to find new things.
The price of old friends is very big.
Friends of childhood are insignificant, but it is important to be conscious of their own way of finding, making and maintaining new friends.
Learn something new, acquire new skills, learn new languages.
Now, while talking about the monsoon season, Asharam Chaudhary, a student of a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, was witnessing the news of how he had succeeded in surviving the harsh challenges of his life.
In such a scenario, there are so many students who have come from a poor family, from a challenging environment, who have worked towards inspiring us with their own hard work and dedication.
Prince Kumar of Delhi, father DTC driver, Abhay Gupta, who studied under the street lights on footpaths in Kolkata, and Afreen Shik of Ahmedabad, the father's autorickshaw driver, daughter Khushi of Nagpur, and father Kartik from Haryana, the admirer of Jharkhand, who works on his father's bliss.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives me energy and inspiration.
It was a matter of fact that once I was interacting with Indian youth in Sanjoz, the Technological Hub in America.
I asked them to think about how they can utilize their capabilities for India.
I requested the brain drain to be transformed into brain gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji have made a different attempt by accepting this challenge.
With their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together prepared the Smart Gauge App.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the world but also makes them aware of any information and information on their own mobile phones.
The villagers of Taudakpur village in Rae Bareli, the village head, the district magistrate and the CDO inspired people to use this app.
This App is in a way bringing about a digital revolution in the village and it is easier to record, track and monitor all the developmental activities in the village.
The app has a village phone directory, news section, events list, health centre and information centre.
This app is very beneficial for the farmers and the Grameen Feature of the App is being used as a market for their produce in a way.
If you look at the incident, you can see that the young man lives in America, in the midst of his lifestyle and thoughts, he might have left India several years ago, but he knows from the corners of his village, he understands the challenges and he has an emotional connection with the village.
But sometimes because of lack of time, sometimes because of the distance, sometimes because of the surroundings, the slightest layer of molecules covers it, but if a small canal touches it, everything appears once more, it leads to the past.
"Santoshji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Very strange , Pumarpur Wari is a pilgrimage .
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is being celebrated this time on July 23.
Parmarpur is a sacred city of the Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15-20 days before Asha Ekadashi, the pilgrims travel on foot along with their teeth on foot.
This journey, known as Vari, is being attended by millions of media persons.
Pilgrims reach there for the vision of Lord Vitthal, called Bhagwan Vitthoba and Panduranga.
May God bless the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have great respect and devotion.
It is a unique experience to visit the Bhidoba temple in Parmarpur and its grandeur, beauty and spiritual joy.
Once I have the opportunity to tell the listeners of Manki Baat, I must attend Parpur Wari.
Innumerable saints like Jnaneshwar, Namadev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still spreading the knowledge of the common man in Maharashtra.
This sage will continue to inspire every corner of Hindustan.
The message of harmony, love and brotherhood is received from all relevant ethics.
It is a mandate to fight the society with respect to blind respect.
The world leader was a person full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and wisdom to make the British rulers misunderstand.
In 20 years, the British were afraid of him for attempting to commit sedition three times.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present an interesting story to you about Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Ahmadabad arrived in October 1916, more than 40,000 people arrived in Ahmedabad today, almost a hundred years ago, to welcome him and during this visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to talk to him.
Lokmanya Tilak influenced Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Naturally, the British were unhappy with this, and the collector continued to deny it.
But Sardar Saheb was a Saheb, and he stood firm and firm that even if he had to give up his position, the statue of Lokmanya Tilak would have been established.
Finally, the statue was constructed and on 28 February 1929, it was inaugurated not only by anyone but by Mahatma Gandhi.
Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak.
Ganesh Festival was celebrated with traditional respect and festivities and became a powerful medium for social awakening, social consciousness, equality among the people.
It was a time of unity in fighting the British in the country.
It is clear from this that our younger generation is still interested in our ancient heritage and our heroes of history.
Today you can see Ganesh Mandaps in many cities and all the streets.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn and develop leadership and organisational talent.
This time, from the statue of Ganesh ji, all the ornaments should be environment friendly and the competition for environment friendly Ganesh Festival should be held in all the cities.
I'm gonna get these things to people.
The world leader has made a sense of self-confidence among the people, a seal and Swaraj is our birthright and will achieve it.
Even today, it is time to say that Swaraj is our birth right and we will achieve it.
Every Indian should have good results of good governance and development.
This is the building of a New India.
On the same day, on July 23, another son of Mother India was born 50 years after the birth of Tilak.
He sacrificed his life, assuming that we breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
Any youngster who is not inspired by these lines will be in India, and inspired by many youngsters like Sarfarashi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Mai Haidekhana Hai Geor Kitan, Baju-e-Kaathil Mei, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
The courage of Chandrashekhar Azad and his enthusiasm for freedom inspired many youngsters.
Azad lived his life, but he never bowed his head to foreign rule.
Just a few days ago, at the Junior Under 20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland, Indias brave women and farmers made history by winning Hima Das gold medals at the 400m race.
In response to my letter, our other daughter was afraid of loneliness and sent me an e-mail saying that preparations for the Asian Games are going on in Indonesia.
I am proud that this is the very moment when the Golden Jubilee is the greatest moment in the life of any athlete.
"Ekta, we're all proud of it.
The name of Unity has been illuminated.
In Tunisia, World Para Athletic Grand Pre-2018 won Unity Gold and Bronze Medals.
I salute and convey my greetings and good wishes to you all on the occasion of your valour.
I extend my best wishes to you all for the centuries-long festivals in this month of August that will keep you healthy and patriotic.
Let's meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago a cricket match was held in Bangalore .
You must have noticed that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Both teams performed well in this game.
From Afghanistan side, bouler Rashid Khan showcased the exhibition at IPL this year.
I remember, the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, tagged me and said, The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero, Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for making a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their talent.
Rashid Khan represents the largest players in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done something that is a model for the entire world.
When the Indian team bought the trophy, for the first time, the Afghanistan team participated in the International Competition and took photographs together.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will continue to play with each others sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, this fourth Yoga Day on 21st June was a different vision.
To see the whole world being one.
Indian and Chinese soldiers performed Yoga together on the high snowy peak of Ladakh.
Yoga breaks all the boundaries and brings people together.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from over a hundred countries have turned this occasion into a big festival without any discrimination of caste, religion, region, colour and men.
While people from all over the world have participated in Yoga Day programmes with such enthusiasm, it is natural for them to have double enthusiasm in India.
It is a matter of pride for the country that 21 billion people of our country have done yoga in our country's security forces, water and air.
Some Veer Sainiks performed yoga in the under-vehicles and some performed Yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our air warriors performed Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky and strengthened everyone.
They did Yoga by swimming in the sky and not on the plane.
Yoga was conducted at schools, colleges, offices, parks, high-rise buildings and sports places.
Over the centuries, we have believed in the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, sages and other sacred souls have shown the importance of Yoga in a literate way.
More and more people make it a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, several people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App to tell me about Dr. Day on July 1 at Mann Ki Baat this year.
That's right.
Only if we have a problem, remember the doctor.
However, this is a day to be a part of the achievements of our doctors and it is an occasion to thank them for their service and dedication to the society.
The role of a doctor is not confined to treating diseases.
Today, the doctor has a medical expertise and has a great experience of how it affects our lives.
With their capabilities and skills, Indian doctors have embraced their individual seals all over the world.
He further said that the medical professionals are familiar with the hard work and the problem of diagnostics.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all our doctors on the occasion of Doctors Day on 1st July.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a rich history without a month or a day in which no historical event has taken place.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true I'm coming to Magahar on the 20th.
Do you know why he went to the grave
There was a conception that those who died in Meghalaya would not have heavenly pleasure.
On the contrary, those who die in Kashi will have heavenly pleasure.
Saint Kabir didn't believe it.
In today's era, they are the same source of inspiration.
That is, the true spiritual saint knows and understands the pain of others.
He who doesn't know the pain of others is stubborn.
At that time, there was unrest and conflict in the world and he conveyed the message of peace and harmony.
He united the world's mind and worked to remove opinions.
His words are true even after centuries.
And Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev is a Guru.
He has guided millions and has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
He taught Guru Nanak Dev to eradicate racial differences in the society, and to drive them away from seeing humanity as a whole.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, "Serving the poor and the destitute is God Seva."
The 50th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I urge all of you to think about new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and new ideas about how Guru Nanak Dev's 50th Prakash Parv should be celebrated in the society and around the world.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The horrific incident in Jallianwala Bagh, which has embarrassed the entire humanity, marks a hundred years in 2019.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and the upcoming Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was born.
In this programme, he has written to the people about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Ramanji thank you very much for the first time.
Dr.
In 1937, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore adopted the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee and addressed the Convocation of the University of Calcutta in Bengali.
It was for the first time that during the British rule, somebody was speaking in Bengali at the University of Calcutta at a convocation.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development and built a strong foundation and built a strong platform.
In India's first industrial policy announced in 1948, the seal of his ideas and philosophy has been sealed.
It was his dream that India should be industrially self-sufficient and prosperous in all spheres.
He wanted the SMEs to focus on handlooms, clothing and cotton industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were set up between 1948 and 1950 to provide them financial assistance and organizational support for the proper development of cottage and small scale industries.
He said India needs Indian manufacturing as well as defence manufacturing.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjees most important thing was the integrity of India, for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of fifty two.
Come on.
People talked about their imaginations, their griefs and their achievements.
Girls in far-flung villages are providing services ranging from pension to passport to senior citizens through Common Service Centres.
A sister from Chhattisgarh runs an ice-creaming industry with paddy.
Like Agnan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of youngsters of the country are conducting medicine centres and supplying medicines at affordable prices to nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal, who was wandering for employment two or three years ago, is doing a successful job today.
Not only that, he works for 10 or 5 people.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on key issues such as waste management at their young age in the tinkering lab.
There are some in the society, without telling them what is disappointing, without failing to convince them, there will be no peace without finding a way out of unity.
In such a scenario, when the common man comes to know about ideas, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not the job of the government.
Even the incident of a small child in a small village nearby can be a source of inspiration for 1. 25 billion people.
With the help of technology, when I was spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it was very comfortable and inspiring to do something.
A new joy and a new zeal to devote life to the poorest of the poor is getting a new inspiration.
I am grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people associated with this video bridge gave me a new strength.
We'll feel the fragrance of good.
Something came to my attention the other day, it's a very different experience.
In connection with the farmers, schemes have been formulated and worked successfully to increase the income of farmers.
In a way, the farmers have a big role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing, and at the same time, they are trying to ensure that the farmers share double the profits and better seeds are needed to improve the yield.
The seed bank has been built for it.
Women are looking at the business of this seedbank and women are also connected to it.
I know something, some don't know, some may know, some may not know, but millions of people do some good things, and everybody's best wishes.
My dear countrymen, GST is going on for a year.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, and today it's really transformed.
There are people from different political ideologies, people from different states, people from different priorities, but all the decisions taken in the GST Council so far are unanimous.
There were several types of taxes in the country before the GST and only one type of tax was levied across the country.
GST is a success of honesty, it is a festival of honesty.
Earlier, the complaint of Inspector Raj regarding tax was raised in the country.
GST has replaced inspector with IT and Information Technology.
From Return to Refund, everything is being done online through IT.
Perhaps GST was perhaps the largest tax reform in the world.
In India, such a massive tax reform has been undertaken by the people of the country and the success of GST has been ensured through Jan Shakti.
It was generally thought that such a big reform would take 5-7 years for such a massive population to achieve complete success in such a large country.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Good morning.
Navika Sagar Parikrama Yes, I would like to say something about them.
These 6 women of India, their group, have returned to India on May 21, covering more than 250 days in the oceans by roaming around the globe in the INSV Tarini.
The whole country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet these women and listen to their travel experiences.
Once again I congratulate the entire world for the courage and valour of those women, for enhancing the dignity of the Navy, especially the women of India, and for informing the world that they are not very bad.
Nobody has adventure.
If we look at the developmental journey of mankind, we can see that progress has been made in the womb of any adventure.
Development is at the bottom of adventure.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhrue, Pramesh Ale, Umakanta Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam climbed the worlds highest peak.
The children of Ashram School started training on August 2017 in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under Mashine bravery.
They took pride in the country by conquering Everest in accordance with their name.
I extend my heartiest greetings and good wishes to all those associated with Chandrapur School.
At present, the 16-year-old Shivangi Teacher became the youngest Indian girl to win Everest from Nepal.
I extend my heartiest greetings to all those brave hearts, especially the daughters.
Tagging each other and challenging them.
Everyone has joined this Fit India Movement.
The film industry, the sportspersons, the common people of the country, the soldiers of the army and the school teachers participated in the event and heard the sound of it from all sides.
If we fit, India and fit...
Captain Vrinda Kohli of Indian Cricket Team has challenged me and I have accepted his challenge and this is a good thing.
Such a challenge will encourage us to fit along with others.
My dear countrymen, you have heard several times in Mann Ki Baat about sports and sportspersons.
Last time, the heroes of Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme.
Chavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for phone calls.
It is true that sports, which were part of every child's life, were playing in every street earlier, are declining today.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes at noon, sometimes at night, children play for hours without worry.
Outdor and Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these games.
The same game is known by different names at different places.
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as 'Chomal Isto'.
It's playing with 8:8 size marshboards, either mushroom or paddy.
This game was played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh, Paddy in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra and Dyayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you know, people in every country don't know the language, yes,
I'm gonna say we're playing this game too.
Who will be the kids and the kids who don't play coils when they're young
The game was played in children, colonies and towns.
Various names have been invited in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh this was called Godavilla or Karra Billa .
Gulibadi in Odisha is called Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own weather, weather.
Like the season to fly the silver.
When everybody flys a silt, everybody plays a game, then we can undoubtedly express the different qualities that we have.
Great people will be serious, but when they play, the kid that's hidden in them comes out.
Traditional sports, along with physical talent, promotes our rational concentration, concentration, awareness and vibration.
At the same time, we know our culture and traditions.
Many games make us aware of society and environment.
We can create a great history of our traditional games by inviting people.
This time, the theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you not to use polyethylene low quality plastic to understand the importance of this theme and try to reduce the responsibilities of our health on the nature of plastic waste and wildlife.
The World Environment Day Website wid-india-2018 has been very attractive in view of the suggestions and suggestions made in a very attractive manner and try to implement them in day to day life.
When it's very hot, when the rains are over, when it's unbearable cold, everyone starts talking like experts about global waming, climate changing.
But what about just saying
These are basically climate change, resulting in climate change.
Our culture and traditions have not taught us to fight nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had promised for this in every step and every step of his life.
Today, India is talking about climate justice, India has played a key role in the CoP21 Paris Agreement, and we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
How can we move on to this
What can be done as new
The rainy season is coming.
Preparations are being made to observe the International Day of Yoga on 21st June.
The world has repeatedly understood the Yoga for Unity in the last few years.
By doing yoga, we always have the courage to love like our father.
If all these qualities become a friend of someone, the Yogi tries to overcome all kinds of fears.
Once again I urge all the people to build a healthy, prosperous and well-being nation to promote our heritage of Yoga.
My dear countrymen, today is 27th May and this is the memory of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.
Panditji's translations...
This month's memories are associated with another person, heroic gallantry.
In May 1957, Indians showed their strength to the British.
The warrior wrote that the 1857 war was not a quarrel, but the first struggle for freedom.
Savarkar's life was full of peculiarities.
But beyond that, he was a great poet and a social reformer who always gave importance to harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has written a very good account of Savarkar ji.
Savarkar took poetry and revolution together.
He was a sensitive poet and an adventurous revolutionary.
If there is an urge to do something, then it is possible to achieve success in all obstacles.
This is not just a matter of Seeker but you can see it in every corner of the country.
If you look around, you'll see how people lose their obstacles.
When we still go to a tea store, and enjoy tea there, some of the closest people would have noticed that they were having discussions and discussions.
These discussions may be politically related, socially, films, sports, sportspersons, problems in the country, this is the problem, the solution can be done in this way...
You will be surprised to know that he has been the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school called Asha-Ashwasan for children living on the streets and slums, for which this poor tea sells 50 of his income.
He provides education, health and food to all school going children.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his dedication and dedication and for giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He has deprived the darkness of their lives.
There must have been a lot of things going on around you.
There will be countless events.
Come on, let's encourage good.
The moon will be waiting for a few days.
I hope that everyone will celebrate this festival with full enthusiasm and special gifts will be given to the children on this occasion.
I hope Eid strengthens harmony and friendship in our society.
Greetings to everyone.
My dear countrymen, many thanks to all of you.
We'll meet again next month at Mankie Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from April 4-15.
71 countries including India participated in the event.
When such a big event happens, when thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participate, imagine the atmosphere there.
Who can stay away from it in an atmosphere of zeal, enthusiasm, hope and hope and determination to gain.
India showcased records in shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton.
India won 66 medals, including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze.
This victory will make every Indian proud.
Everything drowned in the same feeling.
Words will diminish to clarify that feeling.
But I'd like to hear you from the player.
It was my dream to be a good player for India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restaurants that went to participate in India this time have won the medal
Manika Batra won the medal in all these events.
She is the first Indian woman to have won the gold medal for India at the Personal Table Tennis.
India received the highest number of medals in shooting.
Fifteen year old shooter Anish Bhanwala is the youngest player to win gold medal for India at Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Para Power Lifter to win medal in Commonwealth Games for India.
This time there are more women than medal winners.
Whether it is squash or boxing or white lifting or shooting, women are amazed.
The last fight in Badminton was Indias two sportspersons Saina Nehwal and P.
Sindhu was together.
Everyone was enthusiastic about the competition and the two medals being received by India itself.
The sportspersons at the Games went from different parts of the country to smaller towns.
They have the role of their powerful friends in every situation.
Last month at Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the people, especially the youth, Fit India.
Come, collaborate with Fit India and urge Fit India to lead India.
I am very happy that people are very enthusiastic about joining this.
Share his own picture at the swimming pool of Shashikanth Bhosle, My Weapon Easy Body, My Element Eas Water, My World Easy Swimming...
Dhawal Prajapati has written in his own picture of trekking, "Fit India is a journey and trekking for me.
It was a pleasure to see many of the renowned people inspire our youth for Fit India in a very attractive manner.
A video was shared by Sanima Kalaignar Akshay Kumar.
All of you must see that he's exercising with Wooden Beed.
He says this exercise is very good for outer and stomach muscles.
There's another video in publicity.
He's playing volleyball with people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences related to Fit India initiative.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for all of us and the entire country.
There is one more thing to say, Yoga is the name of the inexpensive Fit India movement.
Yoga has a special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have started preparing for it.
The significance of the International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been recognized by the entire world.
You'll be ready now.
Not alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your college, everywhere, everywhere, everybody, everybody, everybody, every man or woman, must make efforts to connect with Yoga.
Now there is no need to specifically say in India or elsewhere in the world that how Yoga is beneficial for the overall development of the body, mental development and mental balance.
You must have seen that my animated video is very popular.
And they've done an animation to show a teacher very minutely.
You'll get the benefit.
I'd like to say something by inviting you to a new job.
Many youngsters recently spend their time learning something new.
Otherwise, the internship offers a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, life gets an opportunity to live a new life by avoiding paper and pen and computer.
My young friends, I invite you for a special internship.
Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation have jointly launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Students from colleges, youngsters from NCC, NSS and Nehru Yuva Kendra Volunteers, if they want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to join it for the transformation of the society and if they want to do something for the country then they can join it.
This will give a boost and support to cleanliness, and it will be a pleasure to know that we have done something before the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
The awards will be given at the national level to the best participants, the best performers in the colleges and the best performers in the university.
Not only this, the UGC will give two credit points to those who are very well finished.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to internship and benefit from it.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by visiting MyGov.
I hope that our youth will come forward in this campaign for cleanliness.
I'm eager to know about your efforts.
Tell me what you know, talk about the events, send photos, send video.
Use this vacation for a new experience.
I would like to appeal to the people to see that how many people in every corner of our country do good things, how good things are happening, how good things are happening.
I have seen the story of the youth who are selflessly gathering for the education of poor children.
A big programme has been started to educate children living in the streets of Dalli and children living in the hunting grounds.
The children who begged on the roadside or were doing small jobs took them to task, so they left for this positive work.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this programme have moved from their busy life to two hours and have come forward to make social changes.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand are a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
Their unified efforts have changed not only their own destiny but also their own destiny.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly cultivated by Ragi, Chaulai, corn or barley.
As a hilly area, the farmers didn't get the right price.
This iron ore biscuit is very beneficial for pregnant women.
This farmer formed a cooperative movement in Munar village and started a biscuit factory there.
Looking at the courage of the farmers, the government has linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now reaching not only in Bageshwar district but also in 50 Anganwadi centers, Almora and Kesani.
Under the leadership of the farmers, the annual turnover of the group has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs, but it has also reduced the employment of more than 900 families, thereby reducing the exit from the district to the job seekers.
Do we think water conservation should be a social responsibility
Imagine how we should protect every rain.
We know that water conservation is not a new subject in the minds of Indians.
It's not the subject of the book, it's not the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived it for centuries.
They gave priority to the glory of every drop of water.
They're looking for new ways to keep every drop of water.
There are large inscriptions in Manar Kovil, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti and Puducherry, and many ponds are still like tourist centres.
But do not forget that these big reservoirs of water storage are living examples of the efforts of our ancestors.
The ponds of Adalaj and Patan in Gujarat, known as Rani Ki Bawadi, are UNESCO World Heritage Centres and their excellence is worth seeing.
These ponds are in a way Jal Mandir .
If you go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chandbawadi in Jodhpur.
This is one of the largest and most beautiful Bavadi (Kolumns) in India, which is the water deficient region.
The time of April, May, June and July is the best time to harvest rainwater and the amount of preparations that we make in advance will be beneficial.
In the last three years, water conservation and water management have done something in their own way.
In 2017-18, Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on 55 of total expenditure, i. e.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by water conservation and water management.

Lord Buddha is the driving force of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the most important human value in the world today.
Buddha's inspiration is immense in the social vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb Tharti says, My social vision has been established in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my vision are in religion, not in political science.
I imbibed them from my Master Buddha.
Though dental, exploited, deprived and marginalized millions have been empowered through the Baba Saheb Constitution.
There is no greater example of compassion.
This compassion for the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha's teachings are traditionally available anywhere in Asia.
I am very happy that the Government of India is participating in the revival of several Buddhist temples, including the magnificent Ananda Temple of Myanmar, which is centuries old.
Today, the entire world is witness to conflict and humanitarian pain and the advice of Lord Buddha shows the way to avoid hatred with kindness.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the people across the world who have believed in the principles of compassion and respect for Lord Buddha.
For the entire world, I pray for the blessings of Lord Buddha for fulfilling my responsibilities for a peaceful, compassionate world building based on his teachings.

The day is marked as an exhibition of military power in Indian history.
Lord Buddha showed the world that the power of the inner soul is necessary for peace.

It is not only because of the analysis conducted in May 1998, but also because it is important for the country.
India's land is a land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India will scale new goals and heights.

But the most impressive impact on me was Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This very small state has shown great work.
Our farmers in Meghalaya produced record production in 2015-16 as compared to the previous five years.
If I say in detail, the MSP calculates that the wages of other workers in the small amount spent, the cost of their cattle, machines or rented cattle or machines, the cost of the seed, the cost of all types of fertilizers used, the cost of irrigation, the interest paid on the state land revenue, the rent paid on the working capital, the rent of the land, not only this, the value of the farmer or his family, who works in the field of agriculture, will also be yielded to the produce.
Besides, a massive effort is being made to bring about agri-market reforms in the country to ensure fair price for farmers.
Efforts are being made to connect rural markets with markets and global markets in Holsey.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi.

I request you all to share your views on MyGov.
What should be the logo of Gandhi 150
Slogan, spell, or what should be a celebration
Today, the country has moved from the traditional ways of healthcare.
Everything related to health in the country was previously only the responsibility of the Health Ministry.
Today, all the departments and ministries, whether it is the Swachhta Ministry or the Ministry of AYUSH, be it the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, are working together for a healthy India.
Immunity is the lowest and easiest healthcare.
The more vigilant we are against diseases, the more it benefits the individual, the family and the society.
If life is to be healthy then it is clean first.
We all took the challenge together as a nation and as a result, sanitary coverage doubled to nearly 80 within four years.

We must ensure that this time too we will do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and everyone to do Yoga.
We must inspire children, youth and senior citizens in new forms of attraction for Yoga.
A series of Yoga related events are being organized throughout the year on TV and electronic media.
Can we create an enlightenment in the field of Yoga from now onwards, as a campaign for Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I'll share the video with you... so that we can share the Asanas and Pranayamas together.
It's gonna help them.

My dear countrymen, on 14th April, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For him, the industry was a good medium to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when we successfully launch the Make in India initiative in the country, Dr.
In keeping with his vision, the Smart Cities Mission and Urban Cities Mission have been launched in the country today, so that all kinds of facilities are available in big cities and small towns of the country - be it water supply or healthcare or education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance.
He wanted that no person should remain in poverty forever.
At the same time, he believed that his poverty could not be overcome only by giving width to the poor.
Today, initiatives like MUDRA Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are giving birth to our youngsters.
He emphasized the importance of water consumption for the development of the country, various river valley athletes, various water related commissions, all are born in the vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, a historic effort is being made for waterways and ports in the country.
He emphasized the importance of federalism and federalism, and working together between the Centre and the States for the growth of the country.
He showed us that it is not necessary for us to be born in a big or wealthy family to reach greater heights, but for those born in a poor family in India, we can dream of dreams, we can make efforts to realise those dreams and we can achieve success.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's mockery.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes for rural development, poverty welfare and social justice across India.
I urge all of you to enthusiastically participate in these events.

Greetings to everyone on Mahavir Jayanti.
When we talk about Easter, we will remember the inspiring advice of Jesus Christ, who gave the message of peace, harmony, justice and compassion to mankind.
Vaishakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and have written a few words.
We see the colour of the ocean blue, but we understand from our experience that water is not colored.
Have we ever imagined why water in the river or in the ocean is colorful
The same question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the question that a scientist was born in modern India.
Now, when we talk of science, first of all, India has become a Centre of Excellence.
One of his findings is known as Raman Effect.
It is said that this is the day when he has found the truth of light skating and this is why he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Hargovind Khurana and Satyendra Nath Bose are also proud of India.
The Boson Party, popularly known as Satyendra Nath Bose, has been named after him.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai and inaugurated the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was a matter of great pleasure to know about the miracles in science.
The Artificial Intelligence will help in manufacturing robots, boots and other definite machines.
Now machines make their brain smarter by self learning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence can help make the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier.
Can we better know about the natural calamities through artificial intelligence
Can farmers help in farming
Can Artificial Intelligence provide healthcare to all, make it easier for all and treat diseases in a modern way
Last year, Israel had the opportunity to join the Prime Minister in the inauguration of the I Create programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There's a young man talking about developing a digital device.
I think artificial intelligence can be used for many such things.
Scientific technologies are known as Value Neutral.
Any machine we want will do.
But it depends on us what we want to do with the machine.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the illuminating bulb, failed several times in his experiment.
Once he asked me about it, he replied, "I looked for ten thousand methods to find the bulb.
That is, Edison has strengthened his defeats too.
Fortunately, I am in Aravalli, the land of Maharishi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and raised many questions for British India.
The idea of questioning again and again is important to know the truth.
This is the real motivation behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't be calm until you find answers to what and how.
On this occasion of National Science Day, I extend my best wishes to the scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages on all issues related to security and disaster during the times of difficulties, and people write to me something related to it.
Shri Ravindra Singh from Pune and Shri Narendra Modi on Mobile App has come up with regard to safety of jobs.
He has written that safety norms are not good in factories in our country where construction work is going on.
Next March is Indias National Safety Day, he said that people should also talk about safety in the Mann Ki Baat programme, so that people are aware of safety.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important, both initiatives and preparation.
One is needed at the time of accident - Safety During Disease - the second is important in daily life - Safety in Awareness Life .
If we are not conscious of safety in our daily life, if there is no such consciousness, it is difficult to be in danger.
We must have written in the boards that are often seen on the way: "If you don't care, the accident will definitely harm you, you will lose happiness and laughter.
I would like to say that the fire brigades in the cities of Fire Brigade should go to schools once a week or once a month to showcase the mock drills in front of children.
There will be two benefits, the fire brigade will have a habit of being alert and the new generation will be able to know more about it.
In terms of dangers, India is a country of diversity, geographical and climate change.
This country has faced many disasters like natural calamities, chemicals and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is at the forefront of tackling the menace of accidents in the country.
NDMA is rapidly reaching out to rescue operations in various cyclones such as earthquake, floods, cyclones and landslides.
Till two-three years ago, thousands of people used to lose their lives annually due to heat wave.
Heat wave deaths in 2017 have come down significantly from around 220 in 2017.
We can understand from this that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people, social organisations and vigilant citizens in the society, I would like to congratulate all those who have come with the help of safety in minutes whenever there is a danger.
The number of such unnamed heroes is no less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces etc. have reached the catastrophe and the brave men are helping them to keep their lives intact.
We have to make a society that cares about the danger.
In our culture, we preserve values, often talk about protective values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it part of our lives.
In our normal life, we travel by planes hundreds of times, and we see Air Hostess initially warning about safety.
We must have heard it a hundred times, but somebody takes us on the plane and say, where is every thing, where is the life jacket
So our ears on the plane have a habit of hearing, but we don't think these warnings are for me either.
This is what happens in every sphere of life.
We shouldn't think of security for anyone else.
If all of us are conscious of our security, the feeling of security of society must have been incorporated in it.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, we had given importance to the topic of 'West to Energy' in Bioyas with the aim of Swachh Bharat.
The objective of this Gobardhan scheme is to clean the villages, transform the fertilizers of the fertilizers, farm wastes, composta and bio-bayosa, thereby generating wealth and energy.
The number of cattle in India is the highest in the world, with around 300 million cattle and about 3 million tonnes of grams per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen Yojana, we are also moving forward in this regard.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
Make full use of this opportunity by forming Self Help Groups and I invite you to become a part of this mass movement called Clean Energy and Green Job and come forward to make the waste of your village wealthy and transform Gobar Dhan.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard about many festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival and Film Festival.
However, as a unique initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first harvest festival of the state was organised.
The objective of this festival organised by the Raipur Organisation was to create awareness about cleanliness and to create awareness about the unique ways in which the waste of the city can be used actively and recycled.
Several programmes were organized during this festival, in which the elderly people participated.
Inspired by the programme in Raipur, various fertilizers were organized in other districts.
Everyone, in their own way, shared new ideas on sanitation, discussed and narrated poetry.
The importance of waste and hygiene was presented in a remarkable manner in which the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of that place congratulated everyone.
Every year on March 8, International Women's Day is celebrated.
A lot of programmes are being organized in our country and around the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar presents the Nari Shakti Puraskar and felicitates those who have done exemplary work in different fields.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development beyond women's development.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
He said that the idea of complete womenhood is complete freedom, and this idea, which Swamiji put forward 25 years ago, reflects the concept of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in all spheres of social and economic life and it is our responsibility.
We are a part of the tradition of recognizing men in the name of women and children are known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Puthan.
Today, our women power, through their actions, expresses self-confidence and self-confidence.
They carried the country and society forward and brought them to a new goal along with their own progress.
Our vision of New India is ultimately one of women-powered, empowered and equal partners in the overall development of the country.
There can be many examples of what women power can do and stories like this can be seen inspiring life by looking around.
From Jharkhand, I have something to know.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand have to remember that this number is not very low - 15 lakh women have organized a cleanliness drive for one month.
These women of Jharkhand have demonstrated that the Swachhta Abhiyan can be transformed into a habit of ordinary people in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, two days ago, in the news, three villages on the island of Elephanta were reported to have been electrified after 70 years of independence.
You know that Elephanta Island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
This is a very attractive tourist spot .
I congratulate the government and the people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves of Elephanta will now see the light of electricity.
This is not only electrification but also a new beginning of development.
May light shine in the lives of people, may there be joy in life... when will there be more joy and enthusiasm than this
My dear countrymen, we celebrated the Shivratri a few days ago.
Now, in the month of March, it is time to cultivate abundant agricultural land, refrigerated wheat and other golden crops and bouquets of bouquets.
Further, this month is a month of dearness for everyone because of the celebration of Holi.
On 2nd March, everyone will celebrate Holi with joy.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much. Hello.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participated in this celebration.
He was addressing the gathering after recalling Kalpana Chaula, who had travelled in space on 1st February.
The Order separated us from the accident in the Colombia space ship, but it inspired millions of youngsters around the world.
Our loss of Kalpana Chaula at such a young age is a matter of sadness for all of us.
It is a matter of great pleasure that in India, these women are fast moving forward in every sphere and are making the country proud.
In ancient times, the respect for the women of our country, their place in the society, their contributions, all over the world is amazed.
There is a long tradition of Indian adults.
I'm Bachao, tell me about Bae Paduo.
In ancient times, Rachchikape said in Skandapuran: Dasputra, Samanya, Dasputra Kamdhya, this result is available Marthya, Tatya Availability, Virginia.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons. Ten sons will get the honour in one daughter.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why in our society, women have been given the status of strength.
This woman power brings the entire society to the brink of unity.
Whether the adversaries of the early days of Lopamudra, Gargi, Mitrai, their pedigrees or the knowledge and devotion of Akamahadevi and Meerabai, be it the teachings of Ahalyabai Holkar, be it the courage of Rani Lakshmibai, women power inspires us.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
Prakash Trishani continues to give several examples.
Our brave Raksha Mantri, Nirmala Sitharaman, wrote that the fighter plane flying on Sukhoy 30 is inspiring.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, he has written about the Indian Navy's women members travelling around the world at INSV Tarini.
He mentioned the brave women, Bhavna Kant, Mohan Singh, who were pilots of Chaturvedi Ever Warfare and trained in Sukhoi 30.
The women led by Dakshita Vajpayee took pride in flying to San Francisco, USA, Delhi and Delhi in the Air India Boring Jet in Delhi.
Everybody remembers women.
These women who have acquired NEE - the first female marchant navy captain, the first female train driver on the voyage train, the first female firefighter - the first female bus driver in Antarctica, the first woman in Everest, and the first woman in Everest.
They asked for a new path to cut down all obstacles and obstacles due to hard work, deliberate action and determination.
Not only their contemporary people, but also the future generations.
A new zeal and inspiration will fill them.
A book has been prepared about these women who have acquired NEEM so that not only the country but also the women power should know about it and you should take inspiration from their actions in their lives.
This is available for e-books on the Narendra Modi website.
Women power has an important role to play in the positive changes that are taking place in the country and society.
When we talk about women empowerment, we want to talk about a railway station.
You must have imagined the relationship between railway station and women empowerment.
Maunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India for all the employees .
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is an area of Maoist-Pacific.
Violence, invasions, bombs, guns, pistols... have created a terrible atmosphere.
Tribal women in such a horrific area are achieving self-reliance by running e-Ordinance.
In a short span of time, a lot of women have been associated with this.
In addition to this, it will also strengthen the environmental protection and conservation.
The district administration has played a crucial role in the success of these women from the time we appreciate the burden of the district here and from the time we provide the grants and lay the foundation stone.
Over the centuries, our society has continued to strive for individual and socially against social evils and evils.
A few days ago, we had launched such a scheme in Bihar.
In order to root out social evils in the state, thirteen thousand kilometres long manned by the world's largest human chain.
Through this clutches, he awakened the social conscience against the evils of child marriage, women's system, etc.
The state together resolved to fight evils such as women's wedlock and child marriage.
The youngsters, mothers, sisters and gentlemen, who are enthusiastic and enthusiastic, have themselves participated in this fight.
Mann Ki Baat started at the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna without crossing the borders of the State.
It is essential that the society should be free from the evils of the society to ensure that everyone in the society gets the right leadership of development.
Come, let us together pledge to free our society from evils and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
He did not know about the Pradhan Mantri Janaushadhi Pariyojana.
Eli now knows about the Janaushadhi Pariyojana, where the cost of desert decreased by 75 when you started buying deer.
In the last few days, a lot of people used to write about it and I used to say it.
The objective of the scheme is to make healthcare affordable and enhance ease of living.
Deserts available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are 50 to 90 of the branded deer sold here.
That's why quality deer are available at low prices.
More than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
There is not only a desert price but also a new job for individuals who want to find jobs.
Priceless deer are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) and at Amrit stores in hospitals.
All this has the only purpose in PIL - to provide affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country, to create a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi App.
I am told that the citizens of Akola have also organized a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morna as per the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna River flows for twelve months before, and Elli is only running during the rainy season.
The river is full of flowers and flowers and it is painful.
A lot of waste is thrown away on the river and its banks.
On 13th January, a day before Makar Sankranti, on the first leg of Mission Clean Morna, the two sides of the Morna River were cleaned at 14 places in 4 km area.
Under the Mission Clean Morna, more than 4,000 people from Akola, more than 100 non-governmental organizations, public-school students, wells, adults, mothers, sisters and others participated in this programme.
The Swachhata Hi Seva movement continued on 20th January, 2018 and the programme will continue till the Morna River becomes completely waste free.
It doesn't seem impossible if someone gets off to do something.
A massive change can be brought about through the mass movement.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district administration and the administrative authorities of Akola for making this work a peoples movement and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about the Padma awards these days.
Newspapers and television news will be published.
It is a common practice to give Padma awards every year, but for the last three years it has changed its way.
Any citizen can nominate anyone.
All the procedures have been licensing, thereby ensuring transparency v.
In a way, the electoral process for these awards has completely changed.
Generally, Padma awards will be given to those who do not appear in cities, newspapers, TV and conferences.
Shri Arvind Gupta will be conferred with Kay.
Being a student of IIT Kanpur, you will be happy to know that Kail has dedicated your lives for making toys for these Aravindan girls.
He has been abandoning scientific temper in Kundi for four decades and making toys with goods.
He tried to motivate them to carry out scientific experiments with the objects of abandoning the Kundis.
For this, a film produced in 18 languages in over 3000 schools across the country inspires Kaaji Kundi.
Generate wonder, life, dedication to wonder.
One such story is the story of Sitawa Jodhi of Karnataka.
The goddess of women's empowerment doesn't justify.
Over the last three decades, they have contributed to transforming the lives of innumerable women in Balgaon.
When she was seventy years old, she dedicated herself to the goddess and dedicated her life to the welfare of the goddesses.
Not only this, the puppet worked for women's good and foremost.
Because of this interest, the entire world is respected not only in India but also in the whole world.

He was given Padma Shri by Kirtiku Maju Shyam ji, the genius of India abroad.
You will be surprised to see the story of Kerala's tribal woman Lakshmiku in Kay.
Laxmiku lived in Kallar A place and lived in Panayola hut in Tribal Area in Kottayam.
Five hundred green deer have been built on the strength of their memory.
There is special privilege in making desert for sarpavisha.
Lakshmiji continues to serve the society through her own knowledge of the greenery.
The world's well-known personality has been recognized by Padma Shri to contribute to the society.
At the age of 23, her husband died without treatment and this incident inspired the poor to build a hospital.
Thousands of poor people will be treated free of cost at the hospital constructed through their hard work.
Sometimes they should be invited to schools and colleges to listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, there must be some social effort.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On 9th January, you returned to India in South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unprecedented relations with Indians living in India and around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we organized a programme to invite rooted Parliamentarians and mayors from all over the world.
In Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Brian, Suriname, South Africa and America, you and members of the Indian-origin mayor and Parliament participated in the event.
I am glad that people living in different countries, people from different roots of India have served those countries and they have maintained their strong relationship with India and this time the European Union has sent me calendar.
Our people of Indian origin live in different countries of Europe - some work with cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some are dedicated to music, some are composing the minds of the society through poetry.
On January 30th, we all have a new path to remember the revered Bapu.
On the occasion of Martyrs Day, we pay tributes to the great martyrs who laid down their lives for the defence.
They're not just theories.
My dear countrymen, I conclude by conveying my best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, 2017
This will be the last day of Mann Ki Baat this year and will be the last day of 2017.
I shared a lot of things with you this year.
The year will change after a few hours, but the sharing of our ideas will continue.
Remembering the great teachings of Jesus Christ on the occasion of Christmas, Jesus Christ gave great importance to service.
We see the essence of servitude in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramahamsar used to say, We have to live our lives with emotions.
Extraordinary life filled with the courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
In this attempt, he had to lose a lot of things personally.
It was a very fortunate occasion for me to attend the Prakash Mahotsav organised in Patna Sahib on the occasion of the 300th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh in the beginning of this year.
Let us decide with all our hearts that we will learn lessons from the great lessons taught by Guru Gobind Singh and from that life of inspiration.
January 1, 2018, that is tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say it is special, I reiterate that the truth is very special.
Indian democracy is welcoming voters and voters of the 21st century.
The whole of India is encouraging you to welcome and welcome the voters of the 21st century.
As a voter in the 21st century, you must be proud of it.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The strength of the vote is the greatest strength of democracy.
Voting is one of the most efficient in bringing about a progressive change in the lives of millions.
You don't just have the right to vote.
You can also be the creators of the 21st century by thinking about how India should be in the 21st century, what your dream of India should be in the 21st century.
The youth of New India is synonymous with enthusiasm, enthusiasm and energy.
The dream of New India is realised through our vibrant, skilled and powerful youth.
When we talk about New India, it is about a free India from casteism, casteism, terrorism and the poison of corruption.
An India free from waste and poverty.
A New India where everyone gets equal opportunity and everyones aspirations are fulfilled.
New India is a power that guides us in peace, unity and harmony.
My New India youth should come forward and analyze how a New India will emerge.
How can we realize our concepts before 2022
How can we create an India like our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom struggle into a peoples movement.
My young friends, we have to organize a mass movement to create a magnificent and divine India of the 21st century.
Democracy of development, people's progress, and people's progress for a capable and capable India.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been opened for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and industry entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to imagine how the youngsters of this new India can possibly possibly possibly get to know about the world and all these projects by the time they are 18 years of age.
Nothing is impossible for a person full of positive thought and enthusiasm.
There's a word in English, Pessimism Leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
The following reports and responses were truly encouraging.
It was a very comfortable experience.
Some people shared the positive impact that had impacted their minds.
Some shared their personal achievements.
My name is Fishu Bhadia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm speaking from a bodel.
According to my husband's instructions, one rupee insurance package was charged every month.
He died in an accident.
So we know what our condition is.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
Our Dandar Gram has been running National Highway since 2017.
My name is Satish Bawani.
Our area had scarcity of water and for the last 40 years we had dependent on the pipelines of the soldiers.
Now we put a special pipeline...
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
The positive changes in the lives of people are numerous in their own way.
In fact, this is the New India that we all are building together.
Recently, I got to know about the inspiring story of Bashir Khan Khatk, who was in the forefront of Administrative Services from Kashmir.
He was among the top ranks in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination, freed from the toxicity of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that terrorists had burnt his heritage site in 1990.
His family would have to leave their legacy and flee where terrorism and violence were too much.
He chose a different route for himself, the way to serve the people.
He saved himself from the opposite conditions and composed the story of success.
Today, he is an inspiration not only for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
No matter how bad the situation is, the Ajj has proved that through positive steps, the carpets of despair can be eliminated.
Last week, I had the opportunity to meet some of the girls from Jammu and Kashmir.
It was zeal, enthusiasm, energy, dream and determination.
I was inspired by the time I spent with those children.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, and I felt that they are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to mention about the temple of Sabarimala in Kerala while discussing the famous religious places of the world not only in my country but also in the world.
In this world famous temple every year crores of devotees come to receive the blessings of Lord Ayurveda .
How big a challenge can it be to ensure that the devotees come to such a place where there is so much devotion that there is no waste in such a place
If there are mountains and forest areas then do you have to say something special .
Vijayan, a police officer named Pune Punyan, has started a programme and according to this programme, an awareness campaign has been started on the issue of waste management.
Whatever a devotee comes, he has developed a habit that he will not complete his journey without doing any physical work in terms of cleanliness.
There's no one bigger or smaller in this movement.
Assuming that every devotee is a part of the worship of God, he takes some time for cleanliness, works and works to remove waste.
Every morning, the scene of waste disposal here is amazing, and all the pilgrims are participating in it.
No matter how big a celebrity is, no matter how big a celebrity is, no matter how big an officer is, everybody is joining the programme like a common devotee.
There are many such examples before us.
This cleanliness drive in Sabarimala becomes a part of the pilgrimage to all devotees.
And the determination that cleanliness is required along with a severe intensity moves forward together.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, we took a resolution to fulfil the incomplete mission of Bapu ji for a Swachh Bharat and a Clean India.
Bapu has worked and worked for one thing all his life.
The collaboration of people in the rural and urban areas has seen a transformation in a big way.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018, the largest in the world, is scheduled to be held from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to assess the achievements of sanitation standards in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4000 cities across 40 crore people.
Talk to citizens and know their response.
The Swachhta App will also be analysed and analysed on the upgradation of various service centres.
In order to transform the city's hygiene into a people's habit, it will be checked if all arrangements have been made in the city to transform the city into a city.
Don't let the government conduct cleanliness.
Citizens and Citizens' Organisations have a great responsibility.
I urge all the people to take part in the Swachhta Survekshan in the coming days.
Efforts should be made so that your streets and villages dont lag behind so that your city does not lag behind.
On the basis of this survey, cities will be ranked - if your city is more than one lakh people, if there are few lakhs of population in the rankings across the country then it should be your dream that you have the highest ranking in the local rankings.
Come, with this determination, once again, we can use the best of our efforts with the resolve of Swachh Bharat to remember Bapu.
My dear countrymen, some things may seem very small, but as a society, a far-reaching influence affects our personality.
Today, in this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share such a thing with you.
For decades Muslim women were being treated with injustice, but no one even discussed it.
Even in many Islamic countries, there is no such law.
But the Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without male sex.
I have directed the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all women applying for Haj alone are allowed to go for Haj.
Generally, the Haj pilgrimage is an election, and I would like to give the women who apply for the Haj pilgrimage to go alone to avoid this menace.
India's developmental journey has progressed on the basis of her talent and strength of our women.
I assert with firm conviction that we will continue to move forward and I would like our women to have equal rights for men and women to get equal opportunities and our constant endeavour to move forward on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic celebration for us.
However, it will be recalled on 26th January, 2018.
This year, leaders from ten ASEAN countries will come to India as chief guests for the Republic Day celebrations.
On Republic Day, there will be ten chiefs, not one this time.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years and completed 25 years of Indias alliance with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that on 26th January, these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will come together.
My dear countrymen, this is a season of festivals, in a way our country is a country of festivals.
There's not even a day that's not connected to the festival.
We've just celebrated Christmas, and the New Year's coming.
May the coming year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us move ahead with new zeal, enthusiasm, joy and new determination and take the country forward.
Makar Sankranti is celebrated in the month of January as the sun moves towards the north.
This is a celebration of nature.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu are special in their own way and they have their own importance.
These festivals are celebrated between 13th January and 17th January.
All the names of these festivals are different, but the fundamental principles are the same.
Once again my best wishes for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my dear people.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
At the age, she is very older than us, she is witness to every step of the country and every period of time.
I had the privilege of speaking on the phone with Didi before my foreign trip.
It was a lovely conversation like talking to brother and sister.
I don't usually talk about personal conversations like this.
Modiji-Ladadi, Pranam.
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes on the auspicious occasion of Modi ji and Didi.
May Didi's health be well, may Didi's blessings be with us all.
Before I went to America, I had a phone call to press Didi.
It was a pleasure to hear the phone call from Lataji-Modiji.
When will you go and return
Everyone at home...
Latha ji, I think the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners.
You don't know what you are.
I know that as soon as you come, the picture of India is changing.
Modi ji yes.
Mother is very happy with this love of Modi ji and Didi.
I am extremely grateful to Modi Ji and Didi for remembering me all the time.
Once again I extend my birthday greetings.
When Modiji came to Mumbai this time, I would like to meet him.
Modi ji but I will be back soon.
Modiji: Come home and eat something Gujarati from Didi's hand.
Lataji, of course.
I'm lucky to believe that.
Modi ji - Pranam Didi.
Lata ji bow down.
My best wishes to Modi ji and Didi ji.
Modiji Namaste.
My dear countrymen, from today onwards, the times of celebrations have come again with new zeal, new energy, new zeal and new determination.
For weeks, the whole country will be filled with festivities.
Everyone in the family will join in the festivals.
This is called the darkness under the light.
Perhaps, this word is not just words, it is an order for all of us, a vision, a motivation.
On the one hand, when some houses are illuminated, on the other hand, look at the darkness in the surroundings.
When this darkness disappears, these festivals are really happy when it lights down.
They collect dresses, sweets and food from people's homes and search for the needy and deliver them.
This time, in this season of festivals, can you try to bring darkness under the light with utmost awakening and determination
Smiles on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals, your faces will shine more, your light will be more brighter, your light will be more brighter.
Can we welcome Laxmi in a new way this time
In our culture, women are considered Lakshmi because women bring good fortune and prosperity.
There will be a lot of women amongst us who shine the name of the family, society and the nation with their hard work and dedication.
Can we organize a programme to honour these laxmis of India on the occasion of Diwali
We have many daughters, sons and daughters who do extraordinary things.
Our society should recognize such women, honour them, take pride in their name.
All of us, together with the great mass movement 'Selfie with daughter', will propagate the same as all over the world.
Likewise, this time, a mass movement called Bharatki Lakshmi will be organized.
Promoting Laxmi of India is to strengthen the path of prosperity for the people of the country and the country.
My dear countrymen, I have said before that, it is my good fortune to have a direct and indirect interaction with many people who are familiar with the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Last day, a student from Arunachal, how far away, Alina Tayyog sent me a very interesting letter.
My homeland is Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when I got the results of my examination, people asked me if I had read a book called Exam Warriors.
After that, my experience was very good.
I thought it would be nice if I had read that book before the exam.
And this little girlfriend has given me a job.
But I have a request for you to help me.
I must read it all.
I'll think about it and try to write things that I feel right about it in my words, my own way.
Once again I express my gratitude to the young friend and student Alina Tayang of Arunachal.
Look.
This time, as was discussed in the United Nations Open, there was talk of Governor Up Daniel Medvedev's speech and there was a lot of publicity in social media.
I saw that speech and played.
The simplicity and maturity of Madwedev in the 23-year-old Dan attracted everyone.
Of course, it attracted me too.
Just a short while before this speech, he failed to win the Grand Slam Jeth and the legendary Tennis Rafael Nadal.
If someone else had been there, he would have been sad and disappointed.
His words were happily welcomed by the audience.
He also praised Champya Nadal in Dan and said how Nadal inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis and how difficult it was to play with him.
The zeal and zeal of the failing man in the same game was to be seen.
If you don't hear the words of Dan Medvedev, I'd like to tell you all, especially the youngsters, that video must be seen.
It has a lot to learn from people of all ages, from all walks of life, from great moments beyond triumphs.
Victory is not a big deal.
Life is a victory.
In our country's sciences, it has been said very well.
The thoughts of our ancestors are indeed commendable.
It has been stated in the academic sessions: Haratina Chetamsi Kasya Manujashyamani Kanchenjunjayojana, a student-seeker, Loksya Lochanandandan, is that one person cannot win the mind if one has qualifications and humility together.
In fact, this young sportsperson conquered the minds of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, especially young friends, what I am going to say is for your good.
There will be debates, parties and opponents, but there will be great benefits if some things can be stopped before they grow up.
When it's too big, it's very difficult to stop some things when it's too wide.
But at the outset, if we stop it very carefully, we can save a lot of things.
Its nicotine is the habit of tobacco addiction.
Eating it during childhood affects brain growth.
But today I would like to tell you about a new subject.
You must be aware of the fact that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
Unlike normal cigarettes, e-cigarettes are an electronic device in a way.
A chemical smoke is generated when the nicotine substance is heated in the e-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes , to prevent it from spreading odour mixture of aromatic chemicals in it .
Even if my father is a chain smoker at home, he has seen that he is trying to stop others from smoking at home and wants children not to have the habit of smoking cigarettes and beedi.
He doesn't want to smoke cigarettes and smoke at home.
He knows that smoking and tobacco causes a big harm to the body.
However, the issue of e-cigarettes is totally different.
People do not know so much about e-cigarettes.
The accident is also illiterate, so sometimes the e-cigarette gets access to the house as if it was flawed.
If someone smokes around us, you know we can smell it.
Even if he packs cigarettes in his pocket, it can be smelled.
And so many children and youngsters don't know or are fashioned to see them roaming around in their books, offices, pockets, and they are becoming victims.
The younger generation is the future of the country.
This new method of intoxication is prohibited in the country by e-cigarettes so that the dreams of our families do not go away, so that the lives of children are not wasted, so that the habit of this disease does not spread roots in the society.
I appeal to everyone to abandon the misery of tobacco and not to misunderstand about e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India, don't you
Fit India is not meant to go to the gym for two hours in the morning and late in the morning.
Stay away from this for Fit India.
Our Mother India, this country is a multi-dimensional country.
There are many human beings on this planet.
India was the land of birth and land of extraordinary people like that.
They are dedicated to themselves for others, except for themselves.
Such a great personality is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13th.
It is a matter of pride for all Indians, and Pope Francis will proclaim Maryam Thresia as holy on October 13.
Sister Maryam Thresia is an example of the whole world, the work done for the betterment of mankind by her narrow life of 50 years.
My dear countrymen, India is not only proud of the fact that while we celebrate Gandhi 150, 130 crore people have resolved to get rid of single use plastic.
India is moving ahead with the world in terms of environmental protection and hence the entire world looks at India now.
I am sure you will be part of the mass movement to avoid single use plastic on 2nd October.
Everywhere people play their role in this triangle in their own way.
But a young man in our country has made a very different move.
When I turned my attention to his work, I called him and tried to understand his new methods.
He said it could be beneficial for the country and the people.
Shri.
It was a new word for me when I first heard the word 'plogging'.
Perhaps this word may be used a little overseas.
In India, however, the young Dalvi gave a big boost to it.
Come, let's talk to him.
130 crore people have taken one step in this regard and our India will take 130 crore steps in the direction of liberation from the coordinated platform.
Thank you very much once again, Mr. Reudaman.
Many congratulations to you, to your team and to this new concept.
I'd like to remind you of something in advance.
But it's time for some people to start training, it's time to plan some programmes.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that by 2022, I had said from the Red Fort on 15th August that you should travel to 15 places in India.
Make a plan to stay for at least one night or two nights in 15 places.
You see India, understand, feel.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all for the various festivals of India filled with diversity.
Yes, yes.
On the occasion of Deepawali, it should be kept in mind that a fire broke out and people were not in danger.
We need to take precautions.
Together, with enthusiasm, with new dreams and with a new resolve, let us celebrate festivals.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
Just a short while ago, I had the opportunity to interact indirectly with the boys from Karnataka.
They urged the children to write to the Prime Minister of India in a programme on the occasion of Childrens Day, the Times Group's Vijay Karnataka Day.
And they published the letters they chose.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These little children know the problems of the country.
They also know about the discussions taking place in the country.
Kirti Hegde from Uttaranchal, Digital India, appreciating the Smart City schemes, the child says that we need to change our education system and that the children of today don't like classroom reading, they love to know about nature.
If we provide knowledge of nature to children, it may be beneficial in the future to protect the environment.
Rida Nadaf, a child from Laxmeshwar, writes, She is proud to be the daughter of a soldier.
What Indian should be proud of our soldiers
And it's natural to be proud of the soldier's daughter.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has written that the school is 5 km away from home, so we have to leave early at home and it's too late to return home.
So she says she can't spend time with her friends and she wants to have a school nearby.
But I really liked that the establishment did what I wanted to get the letters, so I could read those letters.
I've had a good experience.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26 November is our Constitution Day.
The Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India on the same day in 1949.
The Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950, so we celebrate that day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They worked for nearly three years to create the Constitution of India.
Those who read about this discussion will feel proud of the thoughts of those who were dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they have worked to create the Constitution of our country full of diversity
When the country gets rid of the slavery chain, how discriminatory and perspective they must have expressed
There's no area of untouchable life, no matter what nature is.
Equality and sympathy for all are the hallmarks of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution literally.
Be it a citizen or a ruler, we have to move ahead with the feelings of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should be harmed in any way.
In this Constituent Assembly, 17 different Committees were constituted on key issues.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the Chairperson of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He played an important role.
On 6th December, on his Mahanirvana, we remember and remember him as usual.
Baba Sahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
December 15 is the holy day of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Sardar Patel became a farmer son and a steel man in the country and performed a very extraordinary task to penetrate the country.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
The Advisory Committees constituted for the welfare of fundamental rights, fundamental rights, minorities and tribals were also presided over.
We remember and remember the brave citizens, police and security personnel who lost their lives.
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism is taking a terrible form today in every part of the world as a day-to-day event.
We have been suffering from terrorism in India for the past 40 years.
Thousands of our innocent people have lost their lives.
Terrorism is a challenge to humanism.
It is the land through the medium of Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavira, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi that has given the world the message of non-violence and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are making a cruel effort to undermine our social relations.
Therefore, it is time for humanitarian forces to be more vigilant.
My dear countrymen, the Navy Day will be celebrated in December.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of the river.
This country, our planet has an infinite relationship with the oceans.
When we looked at history, 800-900 years ago, during the colony, the Cola Navy was considered as the most powerful naval force.
In the growth of the Chola Empire, their navy had a huge role to play in making them economically super-powerful.
Several examples of coastal naval operations and exploration journeys can be seen collectively.
Very few people are aware that most of the naval forces in the world have allowed women in very late warships.
However, a large number of women had played an important role in the Coal Navy, even 800-900 years ago.
The women even took part in the war.
Cola rulers knew very well about shipbuilding.
When we talk about the Navy, who can forget the ability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his ability to build a naval force
The Konkan coast was in the land of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Janjira and Golden Durga related to Shivaji Maharaj were either on the seashore or on the seashore.
Maratha Navy was waiting for the safety of these forts.
The Maratha Naval Force consisted of large ships and small boats.
Their navy was very capable of attacking any enemy and defending the country from enemies.
How can we not remember Kanhoji Agra when we talk about Maratha Navy
He took the Maratha Navy to a new level and built bases of Maratha Naval Forces at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy showered their valour on various occasions, be it in the liberation movement of Goa or in the war of India-Pakistan in 1971.
When we talk about the Navy, war is visible, but the Indian Navy has come forward with the same enthusiasm in humanitarian matters.
The ship Sumitra immediately helped save the people and handed over many of the fishermen to Bangladesh safely from the sea.
When there was a major flood in Sri Lanka in May-June this year, three ships of our Navy arrived there immediately and helped the government and the people there.
On 21st November, when a trading ship was robbed in the Western Gulf, INS Trikand arrived for assistance.
Whether it is for delivering healthcare services to Fuji or for providing immediate assistance to the neighbouring country, our navy has been doing a proud job, we are always proud of our security forces and respected them.
Whether it is the Army or the Navy or the Air Force... all Indians salute the bravery, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live comfortably and peacefully for the 125 crore people.
The Army Flag Day is celebrated on 7th December every year.
It is a day to be proud of the soldiers of the country and to pay homage to them.
I am glad that this time, the Ministry of Defence has decided to organize a programme from 1st to 7th December, to reach out to the citizens of the country and to inform people about the Armed Forces and to make them aware.
Children and adults should wear a flag all week.
There must be a movement of respect for the army in the country.
Calling soldiers in schools and colleges, they can learn about the army.
Our new generation can make it a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This opportunity is for the welfare of all the soldiers of our Armed Forces.
This fund is being utilised through the Military Welfare Board to help the families of the soldiers who were heroic in the war, to rehabilitate the injured soldiers.
Let us contribute ourselves for their good.
I would like to say something to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
All we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to the entire soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no harvest soil in this world.
I'm scared when I think.
In our culture, we have thought about it a long time ago, so we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
On the one hand, in our culture, on the one hand, there is a natural effort to have devotion and gratitude to the soil, on the other hand, scientific schemes were part of life to ensure that the soil continues to receive its nutrition.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to soil and scientific maintenance of soil.
We are proud that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are interested in modern sciences and are trying to make reasonable decisions.
I heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorad Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The yield of soil has gradually come down and the yield of soil has come down.
Some of the farmers of the village understood the seriousness of the situation and reiterated their suggestions on how many chemicals, other fertilizers, micro nutrients and organic farming should be provided in time.
You will be surprised to know what was the result of the suggestions received from the scrutiny of soil health.
And soil has also increased.
Farmers have started feeling that if we want to think about crops then we should first think about the Earth and if we are ready to protect the Mother Earth then the land will wait for us.
Our farmers have produced more than 10 crore soil health cards across the country to know the soil well and to harvest it accordingly.
We have devotion to the Mother Earth, but do you think how harmful it is to the health of the Mother of Mother Earth with chemicals like urea
All types of scientific methods have proved that the use of more urea is causing serious damage to the mother Earth.
Can our farmers and the children of our soil make a decision that by 2022, we will utilise half of the urea used in the agricultural field by 75 years of independence
We are beginning to feel global warming and climate change.
There was a time when it was cold before Diwali.
It's starting December, the cold is slowly moving.
The 8-year-old non-communicable boy made Whistle his weapon.
At 5 a.m. in the morning, he went to the houses of the village, whispered people and began teaching them not to defecate in the open space.
Kumhari Village has become Open Defecation Free due to this child who has gone to 30-40 households every day to teach about cleanliness.
The young Balan Tushar has done a motivational job in promoting cleanliness.
Our divyang brothers and sisters are determined, capable and brave.
We've got something to learn.
Today, they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is in sports or in any competition or in any social step, our Divyang people are not far behind.
Our Divyang sportspersons have won 4 medals at the Rio Olympics with a very good performance.
Different types of competitions are being held across the country.
The last day, the 17th National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in this and displayed their skills.
One of them is Jigar Thakur from Gujarat and 80 percent of his body has no muscles.
As a result of his skills, he was chosen for the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics.
He is one of the 32 para swimmers trained at Centre for Excellence, Gandhinagar.
My greetings to Jigar Thakkar... and my best wishes to him.
Today, Divyangjan can reach any field and he is particularly concerned about opportunities.
Our effort is to ensure that everyone in the country becomes capable and a society inclusive of all must be formed.
After a few days, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
This is the day when Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
My heartiest greetings to all the countrymen.
This suggestion is very good, but I feel like adding something to this suggestion and making changes.
Our village elders always say.
Forget sadness, don't forget comfort.
Can't you guarantee your role in this
Come, let us share good wishes on Narendra Modi App, MyGov or on Social Media in Positive India (Hashtag Positive India).
Let's remember the events that inspire others.
Remembering good things, you have a feeling of doing good.
It gives you the energy to do good things.
Let us see the strength and consequences of this united movement together.
There'll be a lot of opportunity to talk about.
PM on 29th October, 2017
Even though the sun and water are important in Chhath Puja, the vessels made of bamboo and soil and potatoes are essential for the worship.
In this festival of faith, the message of worshipping sunrise and sunset is full of unique culture.
The world will respect and worship those who grow up.
But the Chhath Puja shrine gives us a message of worship to those who are sure.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also associated with this festival.
Cleansing the entire house before Chhath and people join hands with a lot of enthusiasm in cleaning the rivers, lakes and ponds, worshipping places or ghats.
It is a celebration of sun bath or Chhath puja, conservation of environment, prevention of disease and discipline.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great heritage of India.
You might be happy to know that this kind of business has been done in a store of Khadi and Handloom.
During Deepawali, Khadi Gift Coup was sold at approximately 680 increase.
The total sale of Khadi and Handicrafts shows an increase of about 90 compared to last year.
It shows that today the youth, women and people of all age groups like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how many families, poor families and families working in handlooms have benefitted from this.
He says we should also remember our brave security forces.
We're gonna have to bring home the sweets to the jawans.
Once again I had the privilege of celebrating Diwali with the brave security personnel deployed on the border.
This time, I had an unforgettable experience of celebrating Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are guarding the country, honouring all the soldiers of our security forces for that struggle, dedication and sacrifice, for the sake of all the countrymen, by showing the hard and difficult situation on the border.
If we get the opportunity, we must listen to their proud stories to know the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us are unaware that the soldiers of our security forces are not only on our borders but are also playing a vital role in maintaining peace all over the world.
As Peace Keepers of the United Nations, they are enhancing the gravity of Hindustan all over the world.
Last day on 24th October, the United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations to restore peace in the world and their active role.
We believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means that the whole world is our family.
Due to this belief, India has been actively participating in various important UN initiatives since its inception.
India has always attached importance to womens equality and the declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations is a living example of this.
It was originally proposed in the Union Territory that all men were born free and equitable, and as a result of the efforts of India's representative Hamza Mehta, the continent was acknowledged that all men were born free and equitable.
Looks like it's a very simple change, but it's a healthy idea.
The United Nations Peace Mission is the largest contributor to India under the United Nations umbrella.
India has always participated actively in UN peacekeeping missions.
Many of you may know this for the first time.
More than 16,000 Indian security personnel have served in UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about seven thousand Indian soldiers are connected to the UN peacekeeping operations, and India is the third largest in the world.
Until August 27, Indian soldiers have provided their services in about 50 missions of 71 UN peacekeeping missions across the world.
These missions were in many parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Labanon and Sudan.
In Congo and Southern Sudan, more than 20,000 patients were treated in Indian Army hospitals and rescued innumerable people.
The security forces of India not only saved the people there in different countries but also conquered their minds through people-friendly measures.
Indian women have also played a leading role in maintaining peace.
Many people don't know that India is the first country to send women police forces into the UN peacekeeping mission in Libya.
This step of India is a source of inspiration for nations all over the world.
After that, all the countries started sending their women's police force.
You will be surprised to know that Indias role is not only in the polity but also in training the peacekeeping operations in about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peace operations are not simple.
The soldiers in our security forces have to pass through the difficult territories.
You'll have to live among different people.
We need to know and understand different conditions and different cultures.
We must change ourselves according to the local needs and conditions.
Today, when we remember our brave UN peacekeepers, who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salari
In his memory, all Indians will chest with pride.
In 1989, at the age of seventy-two, he became the Operation Force Commander in Namibia, and served the country's Freedom Foundation.
General Timmai Cyprus, the head of the Indian Army, led the United Nations Peacekeeping Force and sacrificed everything for peace.
As a peacekeeper, India has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony throughout the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move forward to create a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our holy land is illuminated by the great men who have served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagini Nivedita, was one of those extraordinary people.
While Margaret Elizabeth lived in Ireland under the name of Nobel, Swami Vivekananda gave him the name Nivedita.
Nivedita was completely dedicated.
Later, they dedicated their names to themselves.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
They are ready to dedicate their lives to the service of the poor through the influence of Swami Vivekananda.
Sister Nivedita suffered from the atrocities committed by the British rule.
Not only did the British make our country a slave, but they tried to make us mentally slaves.
They were constantly striving to create a sense of negativity among us by showing our culture a humiliating one.
Bhagini has re-established the pride of Indian culture.
Subrahmanya Bharati, a renowned nationalist and Tamil poet, is known for her empowerment.
It is said that Bhagni is inspired by it.
Bhagni Nivedita was a great scientist who worked in collaboration with Jagdish Chandra Bose.
They helped spread the research of the boss through articles and conferences.
India's special beauty is that in our culture spirituality and science are rich in each other.
Sister Nivedita and Jagdish Chandra Bose are strong examples of this.
Hundreds of people died when a terrible plague stretched out in Calcutta in 1899.
Sister Nivedita started work on drains and roads without considering her own health.
Sister Nivedita was a woman who had left for serving the poor despite her comfortable life.
Inspired by their sacrifices, people came forward to cooperate in services.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the greatest heroes and heroes in building a New India.
Your concern is that the illness that preceded adults, the illness that took place in the evening of life, has recently started to see children.
It is surprising to hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are said to be lifestyle disorders.
The main reason for occurrence of such diseases in youngsters is physical activity in lifestyle like lack of physical activity and change in food habits .
Society and families have to pay attention to this.
If you think about it, you'll see no need to do anything special.
It is only necessary to make small things accurately and systematically habituated and make them their own.
Instead of climbing up and down the elevator, make a habit of climbing up and down the stairs.
After dinner, take the whole family with the kids and try to spend some time.
Yoga for Young India and Yoga for Youth India.
I'm practicing it, and I'm saying that a person of any age can do it easily.
It's simple because it cannot learn, and it's easy to do anywhere.
It doesn't need special equipment or fields.
There are several studies on how beneficial Yoga is in control of diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives, not just as a medium of treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I have received good news from sports.
Our sportspersons have glorified the country in different sports.
India won the Asia Cup hockey crown in Hockey.
Our sportspersons played well and that is why India became Asia Cup champions after 10 years.
Earlier, India had won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
I convey my best wishes to the entire team and the sports staff who have helped them.
After Hockey, India also heard good news from Batminton.
Batminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has made Indians proud by winning the Danish Open Crown with the best performance.
After the Australian Open and Indonesia Open, the Super Series Preserver crown was awarded.
I convey my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and for enhancing India's pride.
Friends, FIFA U-17 World Cup was held this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showcased their skills on the football field.
I had a chance to see a game too.
Players and audiences were very excited.
World Cup competitions were conducted successfully and all teams showed their best performance.
India was not able to win the crown but the young sportspersons of India took everyone's heart.
The entire world, including India, enjoyed the festival of this game and the tournament was attractive and attractive to football lovers.
The future of the football is bright.
I once again extend my best wishes and good wishes to all the sportspersons, to all those who have worked with them.
Some send photos of children's missions in this regard, some will be the story of youngsters' collective effort.
There, a team of non-governmental organizations called the Ecosystem Protection Organization (Ecosystem Protection Organisation) came to clean the Chandrapur Fort.
In this two-and-a-half-day long work, people continued to clean up the fort as a team without being tired and tired.
I am amazed to see the picture, I am amazed to hear people who are disappointed with the surrounding filth and who are disappointed with the dream of cleanliness. I would like to tell you that you will see the youth of the eco-protection organization, their sweat, their enthusiasm, their determination in those active pictures.
Your despair, your faith.
This sanitation drive is a wonderful example of beauty, co-existence and humanity.
My dear countrymen, on 4th November, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
By eating together, the feeling of unity and equality grew in the minds of the people.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages to the real life - convey the name of God, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev wrote to tell him what he had to say.
We are going to celebrate Guru Nanak Dev's 550th birth anniversary in the coming year 2019.
Come, let us try to move forward on the path of his message and his lessons.
My dear countrymen, after two days, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he has laid the foundation for a modern Akhand Bharat.
We can learn a lot by travelling through the unusual life of that great son of Bharat Mata.
His expertise was to bring thoughts into action.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a stakeholder of India's work on a stakeholder.
He asserted that crores of Indians should be brought under the umbrella of a nation, a Constitution.
He was able to overcome all obstacles in his determination.
He set a goal, moved forward and moved forward towards that goal.
He could only do this thing to make the country one.
Everyone was an equal nation in his imagination.
I would like to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel always inspires us.
These words of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and inspiring for our vision of New India.
That is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this festival of mutual goodwill called the Region for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, all of you will resume your daily life with a new imagination and with a new resolve.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for their dreams.
The Mann Ki Baat programme, which is telling you through Akashwani, has been completed in three years.
It's thirty-sixth episode today.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can say a little about those who send their minds to every corner of the country but I get a lot of treasure.
Mostly inspires me.
A lot of things are about reforming government matters.
Sometimes there will be personal complaints and sometimes it will attract attention to social problems.
Whenever I say Mann Ki Baat, I remember Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
I am sure that after three years, sociologists, universities, researchers and media experts will analyze this and bring to light the contents of all issues.
I am sure that this discussion will be of greater use to Mann Ki Baat in the future and will get a new energy and new energy.
Mann Ki Baat said that whenever we eat, we should take as much as we need, not waste as we like.
However, letters from all corners of the country, from social organizations, from youth have come out that they are already doing this.
After that, a lot of people have come forward to do such work for cleanliness.
And not only in India but in the entire world, the Self-Doter Programme has become a big milestone.
This is not just a problem of social media.
Every girl has a new confidence, a new proud moment.
All parents began to feel like taking selfies with their own daughters.
All the girls started feeling that they have importance and importance.
The other day I was talking to the Central Tourism Department...
I told the tourist destinations that wherever they go, they should be connected to a unique India.
Millions of photographs, paintings from all corners of the weight, in a way, are a big treasure for those working in the tourism sector.
In Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that the small event is a mass movement.
It's been three years since I remember that events in the last three years have appeared in my heart.
The country is moving ahead in the right direction.
It's a big capital for any country, a big power.
I salute the people with my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat and said that Khadi is not a dress but a thought-provoking one.
Youngsters seem to be increasingly interested in Tail Khadi.
The sale of Khadi has increased, so the households of the poor are connected directly to employment.
The Khadi rebate is being issued from 2nd October and is very low.
This will give strength to the poor of our country and we will do it.
Due to this increased interest in Khadi, the people working in the Khadi sector are increasingly enthusiastic to think in a new way in the tax regime for those associated with Khadi and Khadi in the government.
How can we bring new technologies, how can we increase productivity, how can we bring solar energy
The ancient heritage has been decayed for 20, 25, 30 years... to think of how it can be revived.
Various kinds of activities have been added to us.
Opportunities for many have been created.
The Khadi Gramodyog Division at Pampore in Kashmir revived its closed training categories and Kashmir has a lot to contribute to this sector.
With the re-establishment of this Training Centre, the new generation will be able to work innovatively, groom and create new products.
Normal people have started distributing Khadi products as gifts to others.
We have a direct experience as to how an object gets encouraged naturally.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate the 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
It is said that cleanliness will connect with the masses.
Our Excellency, the President began this and the nation joined it.
The older people, men, women, cities and villages have become a part of the Swachh Bharat Mission today.
I thank the Honble President.
People from all walks of life have considered this as their concern and all are connected with it.
Whether it is in the field of sports or in the field of films, in the field of education, in schools or in colleges or in universities or in the field of agriculture, be it the workers or the government employees or the police or the soldiers, all these are connected with this.
There has been a change in public spaces to prevent others from polluting public places, where people working there are beginning to feel some pressure.
It is a matter of great pleasure for me that in the first four days of the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign, more than 75 lakh people have joined hands with more than 40,000 initiatives.
We've seen one more thing this time, we clean one place, and others are careful not to be dirty.
But if cleanliness becomes a habit, it must become an emotional one.
This time, along with Swachhata Hi Seva, fishes also took place.
More than two and a half million children participated in the Swachhta related edition.
Thousands of children painted colourful pictures.
I do not forget to express my gratitude to the media persons when it comes to cleanliness.
They pursued this mass movement with utmost respect.
They joined them in their own way and contributed immensely in creating a progressive environment.
A few days ago, someone paid attention to the work of the 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
When you talk about Brandi Ambassador, you will think that he will be a hero in the sports sector.
On seeing plastic, polyethylene, utilized bottles and other waste materials, Bilal removes them and thereby generates a little income.
Bilal's corp ration gave a vehicle and a uniform, and he went to other places to teach people the lessons of cleanliness, motivates them, and stays behind them until the results are seen.
Bilal Dar is younger than his age but he's inspired by everyone interested in hygiene.
I appreciate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of todays history, when we talk of history, it is natural for me to remember the great men.
This October is the month to remember many great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who had laid the foundation for the twenty-first century, who gave us leadership, who had suffered many hardships for the country, we are in front of us in the month of October.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayalji.
What was the central point of all these great men
Usually there was one thing - living for the country, doing something for the country...
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji and Deendayal ji were far away from the corridors of power, but in a minute they lived with their lives and worked for them.
Deendayal Upadhyaya and Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the last man in the society.
Sardar Saheb has united the country.
We have to run for unity and take the unifying force forward.
Feel the diversity of this India, touch it, feel its fragrance.
You can see that these diversities of our country will become a major curriculum for the development of your personality.
Days of holidays, Diwali... we have a habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
Tourist journeys are natural.
But it is a matter of concern that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of the country, we don't understand it, we don't understand it, we don't understand it, but we're starting to like travel abroad because of the influence of colour.
The people of western India do not know what is in Eastern India .
Our country is full of diversity
Considering the fact that Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam ji had said that when they went on a miracle in India, they got a new inspiration to see, understand India, live and die for them.
These great men have travelled all over weight.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to understand and understand India.
He tried to embrace India.
As a student, can we try to embrace our different states, different societies, people, their livelihoods, their traditions, their disciplines, their food habits and their understanding
It's not just because we see the value addition to tourism, but because as a student, we know it and try to become a part of it.
With my own experience, I have had the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of the country.
In more than 450 districts, I've got a chance to stay at night.
Today, when I take this responsibility in this country, the experiences of those journeys are of great benefit to me.
I'm comfortable understanding things.
I urge you not to be a seal of unity in the diversity of this vast India, but to feel the storehouse of our immense strength.
It has the dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food habits are there
If you eat all your life every day, you'll never have to repeat it.
This is a major strength of our tourism sector.
Not only do you want to go out of the house during this vacation, you don't want to go out for a change, go for something to know, understand and achieve something.
Inclusive of India is the diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be more prosperous with these experiences.
The limits of your thoughts will be broad.
Who is a greater guru than an experience
Normally, the time from October to March is the time of the journey.
People are leaving.
I am sure if you go this time, you will take my call forward.
Share your experiences, share pictures wherever you go.
Send photos on Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you can interact with people where you go, send them pictures.
Not only of buildings, but also of natural beauty, but also of public life there.
Write a good article about the trip.
Send it to MyGov, send it to NarendraModi App.
I feel that it would be good to encourage tourism in India by identifying the best seven tourist destinations in your state and informing all Indians about those seven places or seven things.
If you can, go to those seven places.
Can you give us some information about it
Making films about such good places, making videos, propagating them and encouraging them.
You can also be a catalyst in promoting tourism from October to March.
I invite you for that.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
I'm a man like you.
You must have noticed something that happened in the past and people have seen a divine example of women power and patriotism.
The extraordinary significance of this is that the husbands of wealth and treasure are sacrificed by serving Mother India.
Can we imagine what will happen if life doesn't exist at this young age
But the patriarch of the sacrificed colonel Anand Mahadik, Swati Mahadik, took a firm resolve in this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He studied well for 11 months and changed his life to realise his husband's dream.
His penny took a firm decision and joined the army.
May this mother power be proud of us, it is natural for all the people to feel honoured with these heroes.
I convey my best wishes to those two sisters.
They are awaiting new inspiration and zeal in the hearts of millions of people of the country.
Many congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our younger generation between Navratri festival and Diwali.
FIFA U-17 World Cup is taking place in our country.
I'm sure there will be soccer rings all around.
Football will enhance the interest of all generations.
My dear countrymen, this is the night of New Night.
It's time to worship Durgam Bai.
The atmosphere is full of poor and pure fragrance.
All around there is an atmosphere of spirituality, a festival of devotion.
It is believed to be a festival of power.
When India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022, we will strive to fulfil the dreams of freedom fighters, the resolve of the 125 crore people, the sizeable determination, the sizeable effort and determination to fulfil them for five years. Let us move forward, let us reaffirm our vision and vision.
Thanks a lot.
English rendering of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 27th August, 2017
My heartiest congratulations to my dear countrymen.
On the one hand, when the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand, it is natural to hear the news of violence from any part of Hindustan on the other.
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi, a country of Sardar Patel, which has lived for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the values of public life, non-violence and respect for each other.
Since childhood, we have been saying that non-violence is paramount.
In the name of faith, whether it is religious belief or political belief or belief in traditions, I have said from the Red Fort that violence will not be allowed.
In the Constitution that Baba Saheb Ambedkar has given us, there are provisions for justice for every person.
This country will never allow those who enact laws, those who enjoy the path of violence, whether individual or society, and no government will allow them.
Everyone will have to bow down to the law.
The law will determine responsibility and punish the culprits.
Our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not confined to food, lifestyle or costumes.
We can see diversity at all levels of life.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Because of our cultural heritage centuries old, we can see that there will be no day celebrated in 365 days, regardless of the cultural traditions and social traditions.
Looking at all our festivals, we can see that there is no festival associated with nature's timelines.
Everything is directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are directly related to the farmers and are directly related to the fisheries.
Today, when I talk about festivals, for the first time, I would like to tell you "witnesses".
Yesterday, the festival of 'Savtsari' was celebrated in the Jain community.
Kurushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in the Jain community.
The last day of the festival of 'Kurushan' is a day of celebration.
This is indeed a tradition of wondering.
The festival of felicitation is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
This is known as 'Kamavani' festival, which is a tradition of calling each other 'Michami Dukadam'.
Our scientific temper has been described as "sorry bravery," meaning "sorry brave".
The forgiving man becomes heroic.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, Forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person.
Shakespeare noted the significance of forgiveness in his drama 'Merchant of Venice' and wrote, "Mercey Easy Twice Blossom, It Blossomth Him That Gives Him Daughter Texas, which means forgiveness and forgiveness, is the blessing of God.
My dear countrymen, it is time to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi in every corner of India.
Ganesh Chaturthi Celebrations take place for ten days.
This festival is a symbol of unity, equality and hygiene.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the Ganesh Festival.
Now it is time for the celebrations in Kerala.
One of Indias colourful festivals, Onam is the main festival of Kerala.
This is socially and culturally important.
Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival brings to the fore a message of love and harmony in the society and brings new enthusiasm, new aspirations and new faith in the minds of people.
Now this festival is becoming a game changer for fun and frolic.
The Navratri festival in Gujarat and the Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become an attractive tourist destination in a way.
Our festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners like this.
We have to think about what we can do on this subject.
Idul Suha will also be celebrated in the gathering.
Festivals are a symbol of devotion and faith and we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
My dear countrymen, the definition of modernization is changing.
A variety of experiments take place in every family.
See how big a change is, how happy it is.
As I said, the whole country is full of intellectual awakening.
I'm glad to know someone's new invention.
Someone has said that an engineer collected some special kind of soil and merged it so that it was imparting training to build a Ganesha statue.
When he puts the lump into a small lump of water, it merges quickly into the water.
He didn't stop for all this.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Mission will be launched in three years on 2nd October.
Its results have begun to show.
Toilets have increased from 39 to 67 now.
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have been declared Open Defecation Free.
Many have lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water came out, the waste spread all over the place.
We can create an atmosphere of cleanliness across the country.
After constructing a toilet, you can add your name to the portal and the name of the family that helped you.
You can write articles in different languages, no age limits.
You can make short films on your own mobile.
Creating a 2-3 minute long, short film that inspires cleanliness.
In any language, it could be a quiet picture.
Work yourself as a partner in this.
You can see how bright this Gandhi Jayanti on October 2nd.
Imagine how sacred it would be for us to pay homage to His Excellency Bapu when we commemorate Gandhi Jayanti on October 2nd after this 15-day long waste-waste programme called Swachhta Hi Seva.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to clarify about a special responsibilities for you.
I look forward to your message as eagerly as you wait for Mann Ki Baat.
Everything you say gives me a chance to learn, so I'm eagerly waiting.
There's a chance to change what I'm doing.
I use your little things to think of many things with a new perspective.
"Principles, I'm talking indecently from Pune.
I once went shopping with her to the mall.
She spent two thousand rupees for a sari, spent 450 rupees for a pizza.
However, the driver of the auto captured to go to the mall argued for Rs. 5.
On the way back, he bought vegetables and in his name he saved Rs. 4-5.
I felt terrible.
We don't even ask questions about price in bigger places, but we also argue with our brothers and sisters who depend on us for a few rupees.
They disbelieve them.
You must talk about it in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful to you for giving me a great message through this heart-wrenching phone call.
I am sure that my people will leave this habit to behave in the way of the poor.
My dear young friends, the country is celebrating the Sports Day on 29th August.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand, the great hockey player, who has done magic in Hockey.
His contribution to Hockey was steady.
I am saying this because of the desire to connect our younger generation with sports.
Play must be a part of our lives.
If we consider ourselves to be the youngest country in the world, we need to see our children in sports.
Sports is Physical Fitness, National Alertness, Personality Enhancement.
What's more than this
In a way, sports is an excellent medicine for unity of minds.
Sports talent portal has been prepared by the Ministry of Sports to identify talents and talent them.
Any child in the country who has made any profit in the field of sports can upload the video if he wants his own biodata.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to select the growing sportspersons.
May you please inform the youngsters that the FIFA U-17 World Cup is going to be held in India from October 6-18.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home.
The enthusiasm and zeal of those six girls working in the navy are inspiring for all of us.
These six girls went across the ocean on a small boat called INS Tarini.
It's called Navica Sagar Parikrama.
They will travel around the world and return to India after months.
These six children travel bravely in the waves of the ocean, for the first time in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
He was the President.
But he called himself a teacher.
He was an educator, a diplomat, a President of India, but in every sense he was an excited teacher.
I bow to him.
The great scientist, Albert Einstein, said that it is the supreme art of the Teacher to Awaken oy in creative expression and knowledge among his students.
Can't we make a resolve this time when we celebrate Teachers' Day
Can you make a mission like a mission
Teach to transform, ducate to mpower, learn to teach, strengthen and learn to guide.
Can we take this mission forward with this commitment
Everyone takes a pledge for five years, guides to accomplish it and enjoys the joy of being successful in life by accomplishing it in five years.
An environment for this must be created by our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
In our country, when we talk of transformation, we remember a teacher in a society as we remember a mother in a family.
Teachers have an important role to play in transforming them.
It must have been in the lives of all the teachers that have been able to transform one's lives through compassionate efforts.
If we strive together, we can play a big role in transforming the nation.
Let's move forward with the mantra of teaching for transformation.
Reproductive woman.
My name is Dr. Ananya Status.
I live in the city of Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre at the Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in economic inclusion and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you that after three years of this Jan Dhan Yojana that started in 2014, can you say that India is financially safer and is showing even stronger statistics and whether empowerment and facilities are available to our women, farmers, workers and villages
As a dream in mind, this movement was launched on 28th August, 2014.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed in three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked with this and bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the total population of many countries of the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have invested around Rs. 60,500 crore in banks.
The Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana are now creating a new faith in the lives of the poor with a simple premium of one rupee or three rupees.
When the poor suffered, the family members lost their lives and some families got Rs. 2 lakhs in a few days due to insurance of one rupee.
Hundreds of examples have come to me about how a scheme transforms the lives of an individual, how it reflects new energy and how it fills new faith.
They interview these people and inspire the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again I extend my greetings and good wishes to you all.
Thank you very much.
It is a matter of human mind that the rainy season attracts the mind very much.
As a result of changing climate and environment, there are very many adverse conditions.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, especially in the states of Assam, north-east, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal, people have suffered a lot due to these years.
The State Governments are also making possible efforts to assist the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens working with the spirit of service are making every effort to help people in this environment.
Soldiers, Air Forces, NDRF and Para-Military Forces from the Government of India are working on a life-threatening effort to help the flood victims.
People's lives are very weak due to floods.
The NDRF team was deployed.
Climate warnings are almost exactly due to the growth of technological advancements and the advancements in aerospace.
As per the climate indicators, if the timelines for our actions are made gradually into a habit, we will be able to avoid major losses.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see citizens of our country preparing for it more than me.
I heard your speech on Chartered Accountants Day and I was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched on this day last month.
I am glad to hear that the goods are very low and when I write to a letter in the North-Eastern regions, in the remote mountains, in the forest areas, whether a person living in the forests is right or not, I am afraid of the address but now I have started to understand the things, I feel that things are simpler than before.
It is observed that the time has come down from one place to another and the number of highways is very low.
Pollution has been reduced due to the speed of trucks.
Goods are moving fast.
The pace with which this transformation took place, the speed with which it moved from one to another, the new registrations took place, has created a new faith in the entire country.
Once upon a time, economists, management experts and technologists will look at the implementation of GST in India as a model before the world and write the paper.
A case study will be set up for all the universities in the world.
Because such a massive change in such a large measure, with the participation of millions and millions of people, has brought us to the summit of success and success in such a big country.
The world will definitely learn about it.
All the states have a role to play in the implementation of GST and all the states have a responsibility.
All the decisions were taken together by the States and the Central Government.
What a big dream of One Nation- One Tax has been fulfilled.
I can see how the officers from village to center worked with dedication and how a harmonious atmosphere has been created between the government and the traders and the consumers, how they have played a vital role in enhancing their faith.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries, all the Departments and all the officers of the Union and State Governments in this regard.
GST is an excellent example of the success of India's social power.
It's a history.
In a way, it is a drive for social reform.
Once again I offer my heartfelt condolences to millions and millions of Indians for making such a big effort to succeed.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
On August 15, 1947, the country was free.
Thus, several incidents in the month of August have been associated with the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
Our new generation must know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people gathered together, tried and suffered.
Historic pillars inspire us to build a grand India.
India's people's hearts united against the British rule.
At the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were dedicated to the fight for life with the mantra of "Run or Die".
Millions of youngsters from across the country gave up their studies and gave up their books.
They went off after hearing the sound of freedom.
On 9th August, when Mahatma Gandhi had issued an appeal to Bharat Chodo, the British Government had sent all the big leaders to jail, during which time the second generation leader of the country, Dr.
Men like Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan were the front runners.
There was a lot of publicity behind this success, peoples capabilities, peoples resolve, peoples struggle and peoples struggle.
This effort, from 1857 to 1942, reached its peak in 1942.
Within five years, in 1947, the British would have to leave India.
I'd like to connect you to this math.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It has been almost 70 years.
The governments have come.
We had success.
Hopes awakened.
The years from 1942 to 1947 were the crucial years of achieving the resolve.
We have been ahead of us for five years to achieve our goals with determination from 2017 to 2022 and let us celebrate the 15th of August, 2017 as an occasion of our resolve.
May there be crores of resolutions.
We will try to achieve millions of resolves.
We have to make a resolve in that regard.
2017 must be our dream year.
We have to be part of this August resolution.
Today, it is not necessary to work or die, but to join the dream of a New India, to work with the heart and the body for achieving success.
We have to make a decision that will be realized within the next five years.
Social discussions can be held for youth organisations, students organisations, NGOs and NGOs.
Let's bring new ideas forward.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can I contribute as a person
With technology, come forward with videos, posts, blogs, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will also launch the uit India uiz for the youth.
This problem is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the freedom fighters.
You must propagate it and bring it to the people.
This time too, I invite you to inform me about your suggestions on the MyGov app or on the Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and will try to tell you about it in time as soon as I get it on August 15th.
I hope you'll end in 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to say one more thing today.
There is a socio-economic science in India's economic system.
We don't ever see it cheaper.
Our festivals and festivals are not just occasions of happiness.
Our festivals and festivals are attempts for social reform.
It connects individuals and communities.
Thousands of jobs like Rakhi makers, Rakhi sellers and sellers of sweets are associated with this festival.
This is why the families of our beloved brothers and sisters live.
We light the lamps for Diwali, it is not just a festival of lights, it is not just a celebration, it is a decoration of houses.
It is directly related to the poor families who make soil wings.
But today, when I talk about the festivals and the economic values of the poor associated with them, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
Sometimes I think that the people of this country are more aware and more active than ever.
For the past one month, citizens who have been conscious of the environment write letters to me.
They have requested that the environment friendly Ganesh Chaturthi should talk about Ganesh Chaturthi and people should have the opportunity to plan the Ganesh Ganesh.
I'm grateful to such alert citizens.
This time I'm predicting this.
I'm sure you'll all be with me in this regard.
This will help the artisans and poor artists, who will be employed in building idols.
The poor will fill their stomach.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor, let us connect our festivals with the economic values of the poor, let us celebrate our festivals with the economic zeal of the poor, let us try this thing.
I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all fellow citizens on the occasion of various festivals.
My dear countrymen, be it education in the country or be it economic sector or be it social sector or be it the sports sector, we are constantly seeing the girls of our country bringing laurels to the country.
We, the people of this country feel proud of our girls.
On the other hand, our girls showed great performance at the Women's Cricket World Cup.
The pressure on their faces appeared to be a conflict.
I judged things in another way in that conversation.
I said, look, there is a lot of hope in this period of media.
Whether you win the game or not, you have won the hearts of 125 crore people.
The youth of the country, especially our daughters, are actually working to enhance the glory of our country.
I once again extend my heartiest greetings and best wishes to the young generation of the country, especially to our daughters.
My dear countrymen, I remind you once again of the August Revolution and remind you again of August 9th and August 15th.
I recall the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.
Make every countryman resolve and prepare five years plans for the sake of dreaming.
We have to take our country to new heights, take them to new heights.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with the hope that the future of the country will be bright.
The weather is changing.
Rainfall in many parts of the country is causing better weather.
Winter after the rains has been relieved of the heat in the past.
Whatever be the hurdles in life, however stressed in public life or in public life, rainy season changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world Lord Jagannath's chariot is being celebrated.
Those who have learnt about BabasahebAmbedkar, he must have praised the temple and traditions of Lord Jagannath, because they are inclusive of social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Only a few people know that a word called juggernut in English means a chariot that cannot be stopped by anyone.
Looking at the meaning of this juggernaut, this word stands out from the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
We can understand from this how the world has given greatness in its own way to this chariot of Jagannath.
Everyone celebrated Ramzan's holy month with admiration and devotion.
Now Eid is here.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to everyone on this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is a month of sacred charity and happiness is a month of sharing.
In this holy month of Ramzan, an inspiring incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh has been inspired by me.
Around 3500 families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village and in a way the brothers and sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population there.
During this ritual, the villagers decided to collectively construct toilets.
Spend 17 lakh rupees for the other needs of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mumbai for making this holy occasion of Ramzan an opportunity for the betterment of the society.
Each of their actions is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they make Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
Three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - were already declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana were declared as such.
I express my gratitude to the government, authority and the general public of these five states.
Only then will the habit of body and mind change.
That's how cleanliness is.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
I noticed something very good the other day, and I'd like to tell you that.
The Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh is an incident.
What was the target
10,000 toilets will be constructed in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, it is a pleasure to know that the common people and the government have successfully completed 10,000 toilets within 100 hours.
71 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In and in letters, in the sky.
Recalling the emergence of the Emergency, Smt. Prakash Trishutri presented the judgment of June 25 as a reminder of the dark period in the history of democracy.
This awareness of light trinity towards democracy is commendable.
Democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
The price of freedom is a constant consciousness of the Attendance as the Price of Liberty.
Continuous awareness is essential in terms of democracy, and therefore, we have to remind ourselves of the trauma of democracy.
And then we have to move in the direction of the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was an unforgettable night of a democracy.
In a way, the government was transforming the country into a carpet.
He suppressed the voices of opposition.
In addition to Jaiprakash Narayan, the dignitaries of the country were sent to jail.
The judicial system was not able to escape from the terrible shadow of the emergency.
The papers were completely unplanned.
Today's journalistic students and those associated with democracy are constantly trying to increase the awareness of the people about democracy in the wake of the black age.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
One year after announcing the Emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, and he described the state of mind in that poem.
My dear countrymen, every Hindustani is proud and proud all over the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, we met in the world.
From the sea to the mountains, people welcomed the early sun rays and performed Yoga.
Which Hindustani is not proud of it.
Yoga was not before, but when it was curtailed by the rods of Yoga, Yoga became the key to bringing the world together.
Most of the countries of the world have made Yoga an opportunity.
In China, people performed Yoga on a large scale, and people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level by mixing the world heritage site of Peru.
People performed Yoga under the shadow of Eiffel Tower in France.
In a small country like Singapore, this programme was organised in 70 locations and a week long event was organized.
10 stamps on International Day of Yoga were released by the United Nations.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organized at the United Nations Headquarters.
This was attended by UN officials and diplomats from all over the world.
This time, Yoga has once again created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about fifty five thousand people have made a new world record by doing Yoga together.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our Armed Forces like BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF and others have made Yoga part of their work with their duty.
Some TV channels have also been published.
The Honble Prime Minister said that in recent times, you have said in Kerala that instead of presenting buffaloes at different places, good books should be given as memorable gifts.
This was started in your regime in Gujarat but in the recent past, the use of buffaloes is more visible.
Can't you do anything
Can't you do anything to implement a book instead of a book in the country
He said it should be Khadi kalese to promote Khadi.
This programme continued as long as I was in Gujarat but after leaving the place I left that habit.
But in this programme of Kerala, I have re-engineered this issue.
Now we're downstairs with an informant.
Let's gradually make it a habit.
Bucca's life is too short.
You're going to give up after you have it.
Even after welcoming the Khadi kaleas, many poor families are benefitted.
The cost will be low and it will be utilised properly.
It's been many years, but the queen Elizabeth has kept the calile provided by Mahatma Gandhi.
There's a variety of letters, many kinds of people are burning.
I've read a letter the other day, and I'm sure I'll tell you about it.
In the southeast, a familyman from Madurai, Arulmozhi Sharavan, sent me a letter.
I need to know what was in that letter.
Considering the learnings of the children, I thought about some financial matters, and I thought the family would have some financial help.
I took loans from the bank under the MUDRA Yojana and started the work of distributing some goods from the market.
That is, the Government departments will look into the e-GM registrations.
She wrote to me that it's very interesting.
They say, "I got the money under the Mudra Yojana, started the business, got the list of what I could give in the e-jam and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office, from the PMO.
It was a new news for me too.
They pointed out what they had bought at PMO, they bought two thermos, and received 1600 rupees.
This is empowerment.
This is an opportunity to promote industry.
It has transparency, empowerment, and has industrial entrepreneurship.
Government e-marketplace-jam.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we can also honour our capabilities in space science.
Today, India is flagging not only on Earth but also in the atmosphere.
Two days ago, ISRO-Cartosat-2 Series satellite launched 30 Nano satellites.
These satellites include India and 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This Nano-Satellite Movement of India will greatly help in agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
We may recall that just a few days ago, ISRO GISAT successfully launched 19.
This was one of the largest satellites India has ever launched.
The newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
It can only guess what our scientists have done in the environment.
On 19th June, a thousand days of the Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
When we successfully discovered the Mangalyaan Mission, this mission was aimed at six months.
In recent times, Indias badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth has made the country proud by winning the Indonesia Open.
T.
Usha got the opportunity to interact with the inaugural session of Usha School of Athletics synthetic track.
The more we engage with sports, the more we engage in sports, the more we engage in sports.
Sports play a very important role in personality development.
Sports has great significance in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If children are interested in sports in our family too, they should be encouraged.
We all have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and the sustained fervour, all together present a new experience.
I once again extend my greetings to all of you, to all of you on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat on 28th May, 2017
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayers, spirituality and charity are very important.
Ours is a nation that believes in God, denies God, idolaters, and those who oppose idolatry.
We have acquired the art of living together with all the ideologies and traditions of all kinds.
Religions, castes, ideologies and traditions all give us the message of peace and harmony.
The sacred month of Ramzan will help us move forward on the path of peace and harmony and harmony.
Once again, my best wishes.
I am very happy that many people have experienced me.
I was enthusiastic to tell you what you have to say directly.
I couldn't read everything, I couldn't hear everybody's messages.
But I've seen everything together... some have tried to learn music, some have tried to learn new passages, some are trying to learn new things from the U tube, some try to learn new languages.
I'm glad to hear you a phone call.
I'm talking Daksha Kathal.
I've lost reading habits.
But during this vacation, I decided to read something.
When we started reading about the freedom struggle, we came to know how many struggles were made to make India free and how many sacrifices were made, how many freedom fighters had spent years in prisons.
I am inspiring from Bhagat Singh who has suffered a lot in his young age.
I urge you to send a message to the new generation on this subject.
I am glad that the new generation wants to know our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Numerous great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
During the freedom struggle, the last great men in prisons did a lot of literature.
Their penance gave strength to India's freedom struggle.
I went to Andaman Nicobar once a year ago.
Cellular went to jail.
This is the birthright of the heroic hero.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book titled 'Massi Janmathe' in jail.
The poems were written in the prison walls.
He was locked in a small cell.
A light and sound show is very inspiring.
People from all the states of Hindustan and speaking all the languages dedicated their lives in this Cellular Jail in Andaman by exercising the teachings of 'Kalapani'.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
What does it mean to connect with nature
Connecting with nature is to preserve a better planet.
Where is this better than Mahatma Gandhi's words
Mahatma Gandhi had often said, We need to take care of the unseen world.
Nature has a power.
You must have experienced that when you get tired, you get a glass of water on your face.
When we get tired, we open the windows of the house and open the doors and breathe in the wind that passes through, we feel a new shield.
When we are in touch with these five pentagons that are built in the body, we have a new energy and a new energy in our body.
We've experienced all this, but we don't listen to it, it doesn't touch the corner.
Now, when you're in touch with nature, you must be careful if you don't have a new consciousness.
Therefore, the Global Movement to Communicate with Nature on 5th June must be the priority of each one of us.
We are harnessing the benefits of protecting our ancestral environment.
We will also benefit the future generations by protecting the environment.
It should be noted that Atharva Veda is the greatest guidance on the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth, sonhood is said to be the Earth.
It is said in the Vedas that the humility in us is the cause of our planet.
The earth is our mother and we are our children.
In our country, there are many festivals and many admirations related to the environment.
Be it educated, uneducated, urban or rural, or tribal communities, love for nature is a part of social life.
We have to describe it as new words, and describe it as new reasons.
There are some outstanding reports from the States.
In most of the states, there is a big stride in the field of vegetation as it starts rainy season.
Millions of trees plant.
Schoolchildren, social organisations, non-governmental organisations and circulators exceed.
This time too, we have to promote tree plantation and contribute to it, my dear countrymen.
June 21st is a special day all over the world.
This day is observed as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, the fame of June 21st Yoga Day has reached every corner of the world, connecting people together.
On the one hand, many segregated forces in the world show a distorted shape when India contributes to the world.
Through Yoga, the world is shrouded in one thread.
As the body connects the mind, the mind and the soul, Yoga connects the world today.
Two days ago, I had written to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
He took some steps gradually in this regard.
I received some suggestions on this and I appreciate those who have sent these suggestions.
It's very funny.
Grandpa, Grandma, Grandma, Dad, Mother, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma
This will be an opportunity to give a new level to Yoga tomorrow and tomorrow.
Yesterday, the film will be tomorrow's picture, and it'll be a comfortable promise tomorrow.
I invite you all.
There's still about three weeks left to be a world day.
This is a healthcare scheme in a way.
I invite everyone to be part of it.
When you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Chief Servant, I got the opportunity to speak for the first time on 15th August at the Red Fort in Delhi, I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been visiting different parts of Hindustan.
What is Modi doing Where is Modi going
I am grateful to him for seeing this thing like this.
If you hear this phone, you'll understand.
Prannam Modiji, I speak nine from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, I regularly see people paying special attention to cleanliness in television and social media.
Whether in Mumbai or in Surat, people have collectively taken up cleanliness as a mission.
Not only adults, but also children are also awake to cleanliness.
Children who blame people on the roads are able to melt somewhere.
A few days ago, I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
What's greater than the fact that cleanliness is connected to my journey
There may be a habit of making all other preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now cleanliness is a big thing.
It makes everyone happy and inspiring.
"When Modiji decides on his journey, ask the invitees, at what level will cleanliness be inviting me
How many tons of squares will you dedicate to me
"The idea is very good, but I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, we have to become an entrepreneur to say that so many waste materials will be manufactured as gifts.
How many people can be saved from disease.
What a humanitarian thing
Wealth is a resource that these wastes are treated as waste.
Don't make it a waste.
If we start seeing these dumplings as wealth, we will find new ways for waste management.
Youngsters associated with start-ups will also come up with new initiatives and new instruments.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, has decided to set up a massive venture in the field of waste management with the help of representatives from cities.
On World Environment Day on June 5th, 2019, the World Environment Day is scheduled to provide suitable storage available to about 4,000 cities in the country for collection of soluble and liquid waste.
There will be two kinds of trash, one green and the other blue.
Kitchen waste, green skins, food wastes, eggs and leaves are liquid solubles, which should be placed in green nests.
All these are beneficial in farming , farming , cropping , memories of what to do in greenery .
Secondly, unnecessary papers, iron pieces, glasses, clothing, plastics, polyethylene, broken doubs, rubber goods, etc. are all dry chambers in a way.
The responsibilities are taken up by Versova Residents Volunteers.
Brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you something very happy today that the Reasi Block in Jammu Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free in connection with the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I congratulate all the people of the Reasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the past fifteen days, the current government figures are being circulated everywhere in newspapers, TV channels, social media.
Three years ago, you took charge of me as the Chief Servant.
Very many surveys have been conducted, very many polls have been held.
I see all this as very healthy.
This three-year activity has been changed in all respects.
It was analysed by people from all walks of life.
This is a very good method of democracy.
Citizens should be responsible in democracy and people should be given accounts of their work by the government.
I would like to thank those who have made outstanding suggestions.
Creative criticism strengthens democracy.
This analysis is essential for a nation that is awakening.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you, and as a common citizen, I feel the impact of good and bad governance on any ordinary citizen.
As I have said, as a common citizen, I have the impression of being a citizen.
Two days ago, in Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker Spirits and other dignitaries jointly released a book on Mann Ki Baat on Mann Ki Baat, as an individual, a very enthusiastic citizen.
I am grateful to the President and the Vice President and Speaker Madam for giving importance to Mann Ki Baat after finding time and for giving importance to it.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given a new status.
Some of the friends also discussed me in the working of the book on Mann Ki Baat.
He said that he would like to prepare a sketch on all the topics he had discussed in Mann Ki Baat, and he gave an artwork to Akbar Saheb Mann Ki Baat to express his love without paying a single rupee.
I'm grateful to Akbar.
My dear countrymen, the next time Mann Ki Baat will shower rain all over the country, the weather will change, the results of the exams will come, the new teaching life will begin... and when the rains come, a new awakening and fragrance will spread.
Let us move forward in this environment by expressing our love for nature.
My best wishes to you all.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 30.
Greetings to my dear countrymen.
Children's curiosity, the aspirations of the youth, the experience of the adults, etc.
Normally, it's people's nature to advise others.
On the train, when someone coughs while going to the bus, the next guy says, "Do it, do it."
Advice and opinion is in our nature.
At first, when the suggestions were received on Mann Ki Baat, the advice was heard, something was learned, when the team felt that it would be a habit for a lot of people, that's why they were sending.
But when we tried to deliberately analyze it, it really filled our hearts.
Those who say these opinions, and those who try to reach me, actually do something.
They are striving according to their intellect, strength, capability and environment to do a good thing.
When I noticed this, I thought these instructions were extraordinary.
Last time, in Mann Ki Baat, I had made it difficult to waste food.
This is an example of how things are being done with the cooperation of the society.
It's the last day of April.
May 1 is the founding day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the people of both the states.
Nature has changed all the rules of sports.
We had to face the heat in May-June this year in April.
While taking initiatives from people for Mann Ki Baat, many people have sent suggestions on what to do during this summer.
Everything is prevalent, not new, but it will be very useful to repeat it in time.
Several friends, starting from Karti, are worried about birds.
They said they should put water on the balcony and the terrace.
Small kids in the family are very excited about this.
If they notice why they want to keep water, they'll go ten times a day and see if they have water.
You'll see if birds are coming.
We feel that this is a game, but in fact it is a good experience to wake up the past in the minds of children.
He lived till 103 years.
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, the Bohra Samaj Burhani Foundation launched a massive campaign to save the birds.
I got a chance to start.
They distributed approximately 50,000 toys to the world.
Ginnas Book of World Records found its place.
Often, when newspaper givers, milkmen, vegetables, postman, etc. arrive at the doorstep, we forget to ask whether we need water or not.
Young friends, I want to tell you something.
Many of our younger generation are happy to live in a very comfortable condition.
Parents also raise them safely.
But I would like to tell you as a friend how your holidays should be.
New places, new experiences, new skills...
Sometimes watching things on television, or reading in books, or listening to introducers, and feeling the same thing yourself.
If the experiment is positive, let's get out of the lucky moon.
If we belong to a middle-class family, we belong to a happy family.
You can see that you have never had the joy of playing in life.
Have you imagined how a big change will be brought about in their lives when children who lead a life like this in the society get an opportunity to play with you
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Go to the jungle.
Sometimes summer gatherings will be organized, personality development gatherings will take place...
There will be several developmental issues.
Everyone will be busy in their world with the help of technology.
Social life is a culture, it is a force.
The other thing I'm talking about is skill, don't you want to learn something new
Today is the time of competition.
It will be difficult to buy the maximum number of markets and any coaching classes will be conducted during the vacation and the next examination will be worried.
But it should be kept in mind whether the inner humanity is ineffective, whether it is away from humanitarian qualities.
Can a little more attention be paid to skill development
Stay away from technology and spend some time with yourself.
Learn some musical instruments, learn 5-50 words from a new language, whether in Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi...
Try to learn something you don't know, and you'll have some benefits.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, you see it like a curiosity, understand, discuss with people, ask them... it gives you a different pleasure to see it.
Try and decide the place yourself.
Don't waste time for travel.
Go to a place and spend three to four days there.
Then he went to another place and stayed there for three to four days.
This will help us learn a lot of things.
Share the pictures where you're going.

Friends, this time the Indian government has given you a good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from silos.
They don't need money.
They're starting to believe in digital transactions.
Do you think you can do this and earn money
The Government of India has a scheme.
You must have downloaded the Bhim App.
Ten rupees will be invested in your account from the government.
If we add 20 people one day, we can earn 200 rupees by the afternoon.
Businesses and students can earn through this.
The project is scheduled till 14th October.
You have played an important role in shaping Digital India.
You will be a guardian of New India.
Holidays, vacations and opportunities for monetary payments.
Please introduce digital payments.
Normally in our country there is an atmosphere of hatred for VIP culture.
However, now I realize that the government has decided that no matter how big a person is in the country, the government has decided not to roam around with red lights on the vehicle.
It was, in a way, a symbol of VIP culture.
It is understood from the experience that the red light was placed in the vehicle, but it entered the minds of the people and intelligently created the VIP culture.
Now the red light's gone, so no one can claim that the red light in the head is gone.
I got a very interesting phone call.
I know people are worried about red lights.
The government wants to talk about restricting red beacon lights.
I read in the paper, every Indian is a ranked VIP.
I felt very proud.
Thank you for that.
EPI instead of VIP means Everi Person Ease Important for All.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to remind you of our history, our culture and our traditions.
It will give us energy and inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the 10th birth anniversary of Ramnujacharya by the 125 crore Indians.
We've been immersed in other things so that we can only remember it for centuries.
Century may be very important for other countries of the world.
Through self-behavior, people who were considered as untouchables were driven away.
Thousands of years ago, he organised a campaign to make them enter the temple and successfully visited the temple.
How lucky are we for the great men born in our society to eradicate the evils of our society in all ages
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Ramnujacharya, we inspire the spirit of strength in organising social unity.
The Government of India will release a stamp on 1st May, 2019 to commemorate Swami Ramanujacharya.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Shri Ramanujacharya.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance for May 1st.
Only a few people know that today we are indebted to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect given to the workers.
Baba Saheb's contributions to the welfare of the workers are memorable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb and Ramnujacharya then we remember the great Karnataka Sannyasi and social reformer of the 12th century Jagat Guru Basaveshwar.
Yesterday I had the opportunity to attend a function.
I got the opportunity to release his narratives.
In the twelfth century, in the Kannada language, he is deeply concerned about teaching and teaching.
In Kannada, he said, Kaya Kave Kailas.
It means that you can reach Lord Shiva's architectural Kailasa through spirituality.
That means heaven can be achieved by acting...
I sometimes say "Travel wins".
I am reminded of the fact that DattapantThengadi ji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Masdur group, had said:
Today, it is natural to remember Dattapant Thengadi while talking about the workers.
My dear countrymen, a few days later we will celebrate the Buddhist festival.
People from all over the world associated with Lord Buddha will celebrate it.
Ashoka's life in India is an excellent example of his journey from war to Buddha.
It is a privilege to see that the United Nations is celebrating Vesak Day on this great mountain of Buddha Purnima.
This time it is being held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have the opportunity to pay homage to Buddha in Sri Lanka.
His memories will be renewed.
My dear countrymen, every effort has been made to move forward in India with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas).
Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas is not only in India but also in the global context.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
India-South Asia satellite will be launched on May 5th.
The capability and connectivity of this satellite will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
It will be helpful in formulating the framework of natural resources, whether in terms of tele-medicine or in terms of education or in terms of deeper technological connectivity or in terms of people-to-people linkages.
This is an important step towards enhancing cooperation with the entire South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
March 26 is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic struggle against injustice and a unprecedented victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day.
His memories of Rabindranath Tagore are traditional to all of us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore also composed the National Anthem of Bangladesh.
One very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 but also gave him the status of Nighthood by the British.
However, Rabindranath Tagore is one of the greatest masses of the protesters during the massacre in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919.
It was an event that had a deep impression on the mind of a child aged 12.
The child who laughed at fields and sports during his childhood, made Jallianwala Bagh a new inspiration in the life of cruel massacre.
The 12-year-old boy in 1919 was a Shaheed Bhagat Singh, our beloved and inspired by all of us.
On 23rd March, the British hanged Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We know that even at the time of death, it was a pleasure to serve Mother India on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru and it was not a fear of death.
All the dreams of life have been dedicated to the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes continue to inspire us.
We cannot narrate the story of the sacrifices made by Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The British Empire was afraid of these three men.
The prison was locked up, the hanging was sure, but the British had the idea of what would happen to them now.
That's why he killed 23 persons on March 24 to be hanged.
They did it without anyone knowing extraordinary.
Later, the British brought their bodies to Punjab today and burnt them without any knowledge.
When I got the opportunity to go there for the first time a few years ago, I felt a special vibration on that land.
I would certainly say to the youth of the country - if you get the opportunity, you must visit the places of worship of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
It was a period of rising independence, its intensity, its propaganda.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
In the freedom struggle of India, a direct reflection of Gandhijis thoughts and his style was seen in Champaran.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 to inspire the nation.
Today, whatever form of Mahatma Gandhi is in our mind, we cannot assess the Satyagraha of Champaran on that basis.
A man who returned to Hindustan in 1915... for just two years...
It was just a beginning.
Let's assume how hard he must have suffered at that time, how much he has worked.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to recognise the organisational strength of Mahatma Gandhi and the ability to make the country proud.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour, mobilised the British Empire to fight the poor, illiterate, illiterate, and to fight...
Champaran Satyagraha shows us this wonderful power, so that we can recognise the importance of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think about Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, when we think about Gandhiji who had made Champaran Satyagraha then Champaran Satyagraha is a big subject for any person who started his public life.
This is the strong foundation of New India, the desire and efforts of the 125 crore people to transform.
New India is not a government hypothesis, not a Democratic Party's Democratic Party.
The New India is the voice of 1. 25 billion people.
It is a concept of how the 125 crore Indians want to build a grand India together.
There is an idea, an excitement, a vision, a desire.
They do it like quiet servants, as they do penance.
There are many who go to everyday hospitals and help patients.
You know, there's a lot of people running for blood donation.
If someone is hungry, there's a lot of people who think about feeding them.
We can say that our country is multi-purpose.
Our veins have the imagination of serving God.
Moreover, if we look at it with social consciousness, how powerful it will be to organize.
When we talk about New India, we have to think about it, analyze it and look at it from a different perspective.
If the 125 crore people decide, if the path is determined with determination, if the dream of a New India is one step after the other then the dream of a New India will come true in our eyes.
All this should not be financed by the government through the budget, through schemes and schemes.
If we decide that we will observe the transport laws, if every citizen decides that he will fulfil his duties with due responsibilities, all citizens will not use petrol or diesel a week...
You can see this dream of a New India being realised in this country with 1. 25 billion people.
This means that all citizens should follow their duties and obey their duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, people in our country have been participating in the Digital Revolution of Digital Payments and have been curious about how money can be transferred without money.
Even the poorest of the poor are trying to learn it, and gradually people are moving towards handling transactions without money.
Digital payments have been followed by a number of procedures following the note-taking programme.
It has been two and a half months since the launch of the BHIM App, but so far the target is to download 1. 5 crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have to take the fight against blood and corruption forward.
25 billion people, if they want, do not wait for it for a year.
I can do it in six months.
Let's do this in everyday life.
You will be a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Several Digital Fairs have been organised to educate people and to create awareness among people.
100 programmes are scheduled across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
There was also a presentation plan.
A target of 12 lakh people received gifts for consumers.
Seventy thousand people received gifts for traders.
Everyone is determined to move forward with this method.
On 14th April, Dr.
As decided earlier, on 14th April, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb, this Digital Fair will be concluded.
We're running a big program when we're a hundred days old.
There's a provision for mega search.
We can propagate the BHIM App in the remaining days of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Please contribute ourselves to reducing penalties due to cash payments.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time Mann Ki Baat gets a lot of suggestions from the people, I am glad that however, the need for cleanliness is increasing every time.
Girls from Dehradun, Gayatri, who studied in class 11, delivered the message: Hon'ble Prime Minister, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to you all for the first time in winning this election in a big way.
I'd like to tell you my Manki Baat.
I want to say that people need to understand how important cleanliness is.
I go across a river every day, in which people wear a lot of dumps, pollutes the river.
Brothers and sisters, look at the pain that a child studying in class II is suffering from river pollution.
The kid is so angry to see the shells in the river.
I see it as a good sign.
New awakening has taken place in the country since the launch of Swachhta Abhiyan.
Hate is also increasing.
Whether it is awake, active partnership, public awareness... it has its own significance.
I want to tell all those who listen to Gayatri in my Manki Baat today that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
Everything you see is filled on the plate, you can't eat it all.
It doesn't matter to tell anyone.
Mothers say in our homes when they pray for children, son or daughter, wherever you need them.
Secondly, if you can save a little from this, it will be financially beneficial for the family.
It's a good thing to think for society, but it's also beneficial for the family.
I don't urge you to do this, but I urge you to wake up.
I know the youngsters who have done great work in this regard.
They've made a mobile app for this.
When it comes to knowing that there is such a snack somewhere then people call it and they use it properly after gathering that food .
It's the youth of our country that runs this exercise.
Somewhere in all the states of Hindustan, we can see people like this.
We may inspire their lives to avoid eating.
As much as you can eat.
Look, it's the way of change.
Those who are cautious about health always say - keep your stomach a little empty, keep the plate a little empty.
When we talk about health, we remember April 7, World Health Day.
By 2030, the United Nations has set a goal of universal health coverage.
This time, the United Nations is focusing on Depression on World Health Day on April 7.
We also know the word depression, but if you mean the word, some say it's depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people worldwide suffer from depression.
Forming a psychological atmosphere starts the liberation.
The first mantra is to say it openly rather than closing depression.
Tell your friends, parents, brothers, teachers what your mind is.
Sometimes loneliness, especially children in the hostels, will have more trouble.
The nature of our country is that we have grown up in our partnership, a large family is interconnected, which reduces the risk of depression.
Otherwise, it's not when everyone gets out together. I'm not coming, I'm telling you to be alone.
Let those who can speak openly to him have a chance to stay with him.
Make smiles and motivate him to talk, bring it out when it's hard inside.
It's a good idea.
Depression occurs due to physical and mental disorders .
As diabetes is the master of all kinds of diseases, depression also eliminates all capabilities of fighting, daring and decision-making.
If you cannot open your mind to yourself then seek help from someone who is serving closely.
Please help, share your sorrows and sorrows.
If you try to understand someone's grief, if you do it with compassion, a new confidence will emerge in you.
By connecting with others, helping someone, serving selflessly, you can reduce the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga helps a lot to get rid of stress, to get rid of mental stress, to get rid of hygiene and to get rid of it.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Recently, the Union Government had taken a major decision.
It should be welcomed that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
The responsibility of the family is to take part in the economic responsibilities of the household, because of all this injustice has to be done to the newborn.
Therefore, the Union Government has taken a major decision.
India has taken such a big decision for our sisters.
My dear countrymen, April 5 is the holy day of Ram Navami, on April 9th, the birth anniversary of Mahavir Jayanti and on April 14th, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of these great men inspire us and give us the strength to swear by the New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year End Review and New Year greetings to all of you on this New Year.
This is the beginning of the agricultural cultivation after the spring season and it is time for the farmers to get the results of their work.
This New Year is celebrated in many ways in different parts of our country.
Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi as New Year in Andra and Karnataka, Chedi-Chand for Sindhis, Navreh in Kashmir, Samsarpuja in Awadh region, Jud-Seethal in Mithila in Bihar and Satuwani in Magadha are the new year celebrations.
India is a country full of such diversity.
My best wishes to you all on this New Year.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 22nd February 2017
New leaves are coming to the trees after the rice season.
The flowers bloom.
Gardens and gardens become green.
The colour of the birds begins to attract the heart.
Not only the flowers, but also the sunny fruits are seen in the branches of the trees.
Fruitful manga flowers of the summer begin to appear in the spring.
Amir Khusro's leaflets have been very interestingly describing the changing moments.
Written by Amir Khusro: Fool Rahee Sarasom Sakal Ban, Amba Faude, Tesu Fulecoil Boley, Dar-Dar (which flowers flowered, flowered pulses, flowered pulses) When nature is pleasant, when the salts are comfortable, the man enjoys it.
Vasanthapanchami, Mahashivratri, Holi celebrations all fill human life with happiness.
Many people don't know the achievements of ISRO by writing on the Narendra Modi App.
So, they are saying that we need to know about the launch of 104 satellites and the interceptor missile.
Bhubaneswar, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for remembering India's pride.
Be it fighting poverty or preventing diseases or be it connecting with the world, knowledge or knowledge, technology and science have marked its role.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have given the world an opportunity to enhance the dignity of India.
We all know that several unprecedented missions of ISRO have been successfully completed in the last few years.
After the success of Mangalyaan on Mars, the ISRO has established a world record in space.
ISRO has successfully launched 104 satellites from different countries like USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan and India.
Together with 104 satellites into the atmosphere, India is the first country in the world to have a history.
It is particularly heartening to note that PSLV is successfully launched in 38th time.
This is not just an IASRO but a history of India as a whole.
The cost effective and efficient environmental mission of ISRO is surprising all over the world.
The world is openly appreciating the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, one of the 104 categories is the greatest.
Our satellite sent some pictures as soon as it arrived.
It's started its work.
It is a matter of great happiness that the entire leadership of this mission has been accomplished by our young scientists and our women scientists.
The role played by the youth and the women is an important component of the success of ISRO.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO in the name of the people of the country.
They have always kept their goal of bringing an ecosystem to the service of the nation for the common man and they are laying new pillars in their crown as it is daily.
India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor missile in the security sector.
You will be happy to know that only four or five countries of the world have achieved this goal.
Scientists of India have shown this thing.
The advantage of this is that even if the mission aims at India from a distance of 2,000 kilometers, the missile destroys it in the atmosphere itself.
We are happy to see new technologies and new scientific innovations.
Curiosity has played a major role in human development.
An attempt to know the universe, the creations, the human minds is constantly underway.
New science and new technologies are born out of it.
All technologies and all new forms of science are born into a new era.
My dear young friends, we are talking about the hard work of science and scientists, and often I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation must increase the passion for science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today's scientists are becoming the cause of a new change in the life of future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, "A science did not explicitly explode from the sky.
All sciences are developed and built upon experiences.
Revered Bapu also said, I express my heartfelt condolences to the enthusiasm, teaching and dedication that led them to the discovery of modern scientists following the truth.
Science seeks to utilize those principles in order to address the needs of the common man, what media should be, what technology should be, because that is considered to be the greatest contribution of the common man.
It was analysed how such innovations should be identified, displayed, people-to-people knowledge, how such inventions should be beneficial to the common man, how to produce more and how to commercially use them.
Sometimes the problem itself shows the importance of science to find peace.
All arrangements are being made in accordance with technology.
In a way, technology becomes an integral part of our lives.
During the last few days, Digi-Dhan Yojana was very important.
In particular, the younger generation is habituated to making digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see it as a good fortune.
Over the last few days in our country, we have received immense support for the 'Lakhi Grahak Yojana' and the 'Diji Dhan Vyapar Yojana'.
For nearly two months, fifteen thousand people get a thousand rupees a day.
Through these two schemes, the country has received the approval for the launch of Digital Payments in India as a peoples movement.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh consumers have received a prize of Rs.
More than 4000 traders have received 50,000 rupees.
Farmers, traders, small traders, other professionals, households and students are enthusiastically participating and benefitting.
Asked whether only the youngsters or the elderly come, the awardees include the 15 year olds and the 65-70 year olds.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysore was happy to write on the Narendra Modi App and he was awarded a thousand rupees under the 'Lakhi Grahak Yojana'.
So I thought they deserved a thousand rupees for me, and I gave them a thousand rupees.
I am very happy that your name and your work makes us happy.
You've done an inspiring job for everyone.
In Maharashtra, a young friend, Pooja Nemade is a Post Graduate student, who shared his experience of using RuPay card e-wallet in the family and shared his experiences with others about how much he feels happy to use it.
On completion of 100 days of the Laki Grahak Yojana, 14th April, 2018, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
On April 14th, a huge prize worth crores of rupees will be awarded.
Forty-five days remain.
Remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can't you do this
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary has just been celebrated.
Remembering him, you should teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Teach us how money is being pursued, especially to the nearest small traders.
This time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, a special emphasis has been given to the BHIM App.
Go home and bring everyone to the BHIM app for 125 crore rupees.
This campaign that has been going on for the past two-three months has been successful in several townships, in many villages and in many cities.
The farmers of our country have suffered and produced food grains this year to break records.
All indicators are that our farmers have broken all the records of the past.
It seems daily that the crops of the fields are being celebrated today with pomp and pomp.
This year, more than 2,700 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and cultivated about 290 lakh hectares of farmland.
The government is constantly trying.
Recently, a function of senior officers of 23 States was held in Telangana under the leadership of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India.
We can see wealth from waste.
It's proven.
If a household with a six-class household has a standard double kitchen toilet, it will be filled in about six years.
After that, the waste can be sent back to the second hole.
In six to twelve months the dirt in the ditch is completely decomposed.
The NPK, as a fertilizer, is a very important fertilizer.
The farmers know the NPK fertilizer well.
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, which are very nutritious, is considered to be a very good growth in the agriculture sector.
As the government takes this step, others must have taken such steps.
At the government level, several departments observe Swachhta Diwas regularly.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development, in collaboration with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, is going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan in the first week of March.
During the second week of March, the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Government of India and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation have taken the lead in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We all know that whatever good happens to any citizen of our country, the entire nation will be proud to scale new heights, and confidence will increase.
I once again congratulate all team players.
The nation is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I have always believed that brothers and sisters with disabilities are capable and determined, brave and imaginative.
We've got something to learn from them.
The women in our country are not far behind in sports, even if it is about sports or atmospherics.
Together, we are moving forward and making the nation brighter by achieving achievements.
Our women have won silver medals in the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy in the past few days.
My best wishes to those players.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
Today it's not just a government program.
The mindset of the people has changed over the years of the past ethics.
It is a pleasure to hear the news that the girl was born was changed into a celebration.
In a way, positive thinking towards girls has become a cause for social recognition.
In Gudalur district of Tamil Nadu, it was learnt that child marriages were blocked through a special public movement.
Nearly 175 child marriages have been prevented so far.
Under the SAUNIA AMRUTI Yojana, the district administration has opened bank accounts for more than 50,000-6000 girls.
In Katwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, under the Convergence Model, all sections have been included in the 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' scheme and in addition to organising Gram Sabhas, the district administration has been making several efforts to strengthen the orphan girls and ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organized to educate the girl child in every village and every household under the housing programme HargharDastak in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan, our children, our school, Apana Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, have been implemented to motivate and re-learn the girls who have been educated in the school.
In short, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme has taken several forms.
I see it as a good sign.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country is experiencing the joy of the rainy season, on the other hand, in every corner of India, there are festivals or festivals of any kind.
This will continue till Diwali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have devised the cycle, the economics and the shaping of social life in any environment in which society cannot be hampered.
In recent days, we have celebrated many festivals.
Everyone can find solutions to these problems from the life of Shri Krishna.
Despite all these important things, take over Sarathi's work in the battlefield.
Sometimes pick up the mountains, sometimes pick up the leaves you have eaten.
I mean, it's a new one for Krishna.
So, when I talk to you today, I pay attention to two lovers.
One is a philosopher, a charming, charming, and another charming.
The Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan left the Yamuna coast and dwelled in Dwarka Nagar on the coastline of Gujarat, where Mohan was born on the coastline, finally reached Delhi on the banks of the Yamuna.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service or the glory of knowledge or the importance of smiling at the bottom of all the heights of life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new pillar of fame has been established in the history of mankind.
It was a part of his life that was always associated with Mahatma Gandhi in service, spirit of service and duties of service.
He gave examples of service in his own life.
This was the individual, society, humanity for Mahatma Gandhi.
He also emphasized the importance of social harmony in different ways, be it in Africa's Phoenix Family or in the Tolstoy Family or in the Sabarmati Ashram or in Wardha.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit several important places related to the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi had given importance to organisational feelings with a sense of service.
We have to bring the emotions of social service, social growth and social organisation into our practical life.
In the true sense, this is the tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the real emancipation.
There must be a lot of opportunities like this, and we'll grow together.
But what is Gandhi 150
What can we contribute in these efforts as an individual
Imagine what value addition you can have.
Ladies club.
Let us continue to do things in the modern ladies clubs, but all the members of the Ladies Club should work together to do something.
We can do a lot of things.
Adopting old books, distributing to the poor, distributing knowledge.
130 crore people have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore initiatives can be launched.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had visited Dandi in Gujarat.
During the freedom struggle, the Salt March in Dandi was a great path.
In Delhi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I would like to urge you all to visit some place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the days to come.
It can be Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaranak, Ashram of Wardha, and somewhere in Delhi related to Mahatma Gandhi.
When you go to a place like this, you must share your pictures in the social media and inspire others.
This time, in the Indian Pavilion at Venice Benale, there was a very interesting exhibition on Gandhijis memories.
The Haripura Panels were specially attractive.
You will be reminded of the fact that the congress was held in Haripura, Gujarat and the event that Subhas Chandra Bose had chosen as the President of India had been recorded in history.
These art exhibitions have a beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura Convention of Congress, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nandlal Bose at Shantiniketan Kala Bhawan.
He wanted the lifestyle of the people of India to be reflected in the art of his art and exhibition at the Mahasammelan.
In addition to his artistic constitution, he also laid a wreath at Nandalal Bose.
Nandal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and finally painted some pictures depicting the life of rural India.
These unprecedented artefacts have been discussed in Venice.
Once again, I extend my best wishes to Gandhiji on his 150th Birth Anniversary and also appeal to all Indians to make a resolve.
For the country, for the society, something needs to be done for someone else.
This will be a good, realistic, realistic journal for Bapu.
My dear brothers and sisters of India, in the last few years, we have been running a programme called Swachhata Hi Seva for almost two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will commence on 11th September.
This time we have to give special importance to plastic.
On 15th August, I had reminded from the Red Fort that with so much enthusiasm and enthusiasm, 125 crore people had organised a mass movement to eradicate wastage and worked towards emancipation from open defecation.
Likewise, we have to stop using single-use plastics together.
Every section of the society is enthusiastic about this issue.
My brothers and sisters from the business community have placed a board in front of the shop in which those who buy the goods should bring the bag.
It can also save money and play their role in protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we celebrate his 100th birth anniversary, we will not only dedicate to him an Open Defecation Free India but also lay the foundation for a new peoples movement against plastics across the country.
Let's turn it into fuel.
What is a bigger inspiration than Gandhiji
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhas is in a way enlightened.
We will get what we want in our lives.
I would like to say a big thing through a Sanskrit translation.
It was written centuries ago, but still very important.
It is a very good interpretation - Prithvivya Trini Ratnani Jalmad, Subhashyammuyya Pashanakhandeshu Ratnasanjya Pradhytee i. e.
Fools say stones are jewels.
In our culture, that day was great.
We have also turned the knowledge of Anna into science.
The awareness about the need for nutrition is transforming the country into a mass movement through modern scientific methods.
People fight against malnutrition through new and attractive methods.
Accordingly, during the harvest season, Anganwadi sevaks are collecting one handful of grains from the people.
This grain is used to make warm food for children and women .
After this, the person becomes self-dedicated to this goal and becomes a fighter of that mass movement.
All of us must have heard of a programme called 'Annaprash' in every part of India.
This is the first time that children will be given rice.
Not liquid food, hard food.
Sometimes people donate food.
When there is a birthday in the family, a buzz or a memorable day, the family members take nutritious and tasty food to Anganwadi or to school and those from their families offer self-salvation to the children.
Sharing their happiness and sharing others.
It is a good coordination between service and joy.
Friends, there are many such small things that can be successfully fought against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of knowledge about nutrition, malnutrition and the poor and the rich suffer.
The nutrition month of September will be celebrated across the country.
You must be part of this, add something new, and your role may be part of it.
It means that if you can save oneself from malnutrition then we will save ourselves from malnutrition.
Everything I've gone in the past weeks, everywhere I've seen people, man vs.
I have never thought that there will never be a chance to touch the minds of the youth of the world.
What's going on
He went to Bhutan last week.
Since whenever I have got the opportunity to go anywhere as the Prime Minister, since then, whenever I have got the opportunity to sit close to everyone due to observing the International Day of Yoga, somebody has been asking me something about Yoga for five years.
There will not be a big leader in the world who has not discussed Yoga with me, and this is my experience all over the world.
Discovery Channel is scheduled to be broadcast in 165 countries.
It is time for global discussions on environment, global warming and climate change, I firmly believe that this episode of the Discovery Channel will help the world in introducing the world about India's message, India's traditions, and the natural sympathy for India's cultural journey.
Today, people want to know about the steps taken for climate conservation and creative environment in our country.
Did you shoot again and again What happened
"I ask with great curiosity.
Look, there's no secret in it.
There's a question in the minds of many, so let me tell you the secret.
Neither is secret.
The truth is that technology has been used efficiently in the interaction with Bear Grills.
Whatever I say, its interpretation continued in English, and he used to listen to it through a small instrument in the ears of Bear Grylls.
I mean, he used to hear what I spoke in Hindi but he used to hear it, so it was easy to talk, this is a wonderful technologies.
After this show many people talked to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You and nature must go to wildlife.
I have said this before, I reiterate, I want to move north-east of India.
You have to spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, the environmental concerns and anxiety in India are naturally visible.
Last month, I had the opportunity to launch a Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
Only a few years ago it was only half of it.
The Tiger Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia held a Tiger Summit in 2010 on Tigers.
Concerned over the decline in the number of tigers in the world, he made a resolve.
It was decided to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India, and we are aiming at it fast.
We doubled the number of tigers in 2019 itself.
The number of tigers in India has not only doubled the number of protected areas and community reserves.
In the Gir forest, we took several steps one after the other.
In 2007, it was decided to appoint female guards there.
Infrastructure has been increased to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about conservation.
We have to think of sympathy beyond protection.
Our sciences have very good advice in this regard.
Listen to what is said in our sciences centuries ago, from the vagaries, the vagaries, the vagaries, the forests, the forests, the forests and forests, that is, the tigers are compelled to come and be killed if there is no forest.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
This young Indian Sannyasi, who has captured the human race all over the world, has established India's brightest personality in the world.
The slave that the world was looking at wastefully towards India, on September 11, 1893, the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda made the world obliged to change his vision for India.
Come, let us strive to live with the true power of India that Swami Vivekananda saw, the shape of an India that Swami Vivekananda had seen, and within us all.
But I don't enter the details.
Wait till August 29th.
We will strive to get rid of plastics at home and abroad with all our might.
I am confident that this movement will continue to be full of social media.
Come, let us move ahead with a new zeal, with a new resolve, with a new strength.
Let us move forward by showing the inner joy with a spirit of service.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 26.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to everyone.
Our Republic Day, January 26, was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens, and our commitment to democracy, is in a way a cultural festival that makes the future generations conscious of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
However, the deeper and widespread discussion is not going on in our country, the more we have to discuss the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens.
Within two minutes, it demonstrates a social outlook, determination and respect for the martyrs.
In our country, the army has a natural respect for the security forces.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Can you do something that is very enthusiastic about social media, especially asking me youngsters
On the one hand, when we heard the celebrations of 26th January with joy and enthusiasm, the brave soldiers of our armed forces, who were guarding for the security of the nation in Kashmir, were brave.
I pay homage to all those bravehearts and bow down to them.
My young friends, you are well aware that I regularly explain my mind through the programme Mann Ki Baat.
The months of January, February, March and April are the period of examinations in every family.
When I came to know about this topic, many teachers, parents and students sent me a message, asked questions, suggested, pained and mentioned the problem.
I would like to share with you my thoughts after seeing them.
I received a telephone message from a child called Creator.
Listen, the creation says, "Sir, I want to tell you that there is a very scary atmosphere in our home, neighborhood and society during the exams.
It is because of this that the children are not encouraged, but there is a lot of heartbeat.
Only a few people who are happy with the exams.
Exams are an opportunity for more and more people.
That's when good happens inside of us, it's coming out.
There is a feeling of strength in society at the time of festivals.
The best shows up.
During exams, the entire family must create an atmosphere of enthusiasm among friends and friends in neighborhood.
You can see the pressure, the plasher, the pressure becomes pleasant.
Encouragement makes the mind weightless.
Look, the change will come when you look at it.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, examinations are conducted in these 3-4 months.
You must understand that the power to call memories is the greatest in the calm mind.
If you're tense, all the doors will be closed, the outside will not come in, the inside will not come out.
There's a hindrance to the thought process, so it becomes a burden.
I tell you from my experience, if you have a mental stress, you have a mistake, if you have peace, you will find things that cannot be imagined and it will be very useful.
The problem is not that you don't know, it's not that you didn't study.
But when you are under mental stress, your knowledge, your wisdom and your learning are compelled to subdue it.
Life seems to be a problem.
Your exams are likely to be a test for the year-long study.
P.
J.
If he had been disappointed because of that defeat, if he had failed with life, India would have got such a great scientist, if he had achieved such a great President.
So, the competition has grown, and psychological pressure has increased among students.
Market and Mark Sheet are of limited use.
It's not all in life.
Life goes on depending on how much knowledge you have acquired.
If you believe in these things, the mark tails will follow you, and you will never need to follow the mark.
In life you will be familiar with knowledge, skills, self-confidence and determination.
His experience, knowledge and success are all together.
So the weight of the market stops us from going the right way.
But if you pay attention to the market, you'll gradually limit yourself to certain things, just to get the market.
This is a very psychological battle.
In fact, competition is not going to be useful for leading a life and it is necessary to compete with oneself to move forward in life.
How better is the day to come than the other day
How better is the chance to come than what happened
Often you must have seen it in the playground, and you know it quickly, so let's give you an example.
Their uniqueness is that they compete for themselves in terms of most successful sports persons.
You didn't sleep because of the stress of the exams before, did you sleep now
Secondly, you're worse than him.
Third, equal.
Just keep in mind how to do better than you did before, how to do it.
Beautiful parents have expressed their views on the role of parents.
He said the role of parents in the examination is very important.
Because mothers are more conscious of the future of children at home, are relentless, they simplify many things.
If you've learned to agree, more problems will end there.
So I have to tell parents that sometimes you do this to the children.
Have you ever thought of giving children a laughing environment during the course of exams
Watch out, the atmosphere will change.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Because I did something like that when I was a kid, and I tried to shit once when I was a kid.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find ways, and I lost a lot of time for that.
"You're right.
Sometimes he doesn't believe in his own talent, he says, "Look at the next man, let's check if I'm right".
Perhaps it's true to write the name, and it's wrong to write the next one.
And they'll write ourselves wrongly and lose their own dust.
I mean, it doesn't matter much.
It's kind of a liar, so don't do it.
Fucking shit makes you bad, so don't shit.
"What is the Prime Minister asking the children to play at the time of the examination"
It is generally understood that students are careless about learning from the point of view of sports.
This idea is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If there is a comprehensive development, there is a life outside the books, which is very large.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to shape life.
This is what's called maintenance.
In my view of the examination, there are three important things: right rest, secondly, sleep for the body, and third intellectual activity, and a big part of the body.
So the rest of the body needs a chance to act.
Have you ever thought that when you sit in front of you, you should go out and see the sky, see the trees and the trees, and make your hearts happy
Long breath is very slow for stress.
We don't have to stay in the room for a long breath.
Some feel like staying late at night, learning too much - that's not right.
You must sleep as much as you want.
So you won't lose time to learn.
A patriarch who came to see me about it asked, how many hours do you sleep
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor
He said that your shutdown while speaking at the time of election is related to sleep.
If you sleep enough, your vocal code will be comfortable.
He gave me a big medicine that didn't think about sleeping, volcanic code and my voice.
It doesn't mean to sleep.
So don't do that.
If you can, follow it. If you can't...
Otherwise, it would be a burden for me to advise the parents of your family not to be burdened.
Remembering your own destinies, you should go to your exams with faith in your own talent.
My best wishes.
Festival of exams to win all exams.
And the exams won't be a test.
Move forward with this spell.
My dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all Coast Guard Officers and jawans for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard is the 4th largest coastal force in the world, with 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in our country.
In keeping with this idealism, the Coast Guard jawans remain in adverse conditions to protect the maritime boundaries and coastal environment of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard Jawans had taken a major step towards cleaning the coastal areas of our country along with their responsibility.
Thousands of people took part in it.
It is a matter of commendation that they have thought of maritime hygiene along with coastal security.
Very few people are aware of the fact that not only men are present in the Coast Guard in our country, but also women are successfully responsible with shoulders.
Our women officers in the Coast Guard are not only pilots and observers but also controlling the hovercraft.
Maritime Safety is a very important issue for the world today and therefore, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have worked on the crucial role of Indias maritime security in the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard.
Spring Panchami Festival is being organised on 1st February.
Spring is recognized as the best basket.
Spring is known as the King of Leather.
In our country, the festival of Vasant Panchami Saraswati Puja is celebrated.
This is considered an opportunity to admire tricks.
Not only this, it's a celebration that inspires the heroes.
Mera Range de Basanti Chola is a source of inspiration.
I extend my greetings and good wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of this spring festival.
My dear countrymen, the Mann Ki Baat Akashwani also offers new dimensions in their own way.
Since last month, my Mann Ki Baat has started listening to Mann Ki Baat in local languages.
I once again congratulate Akashwani for starting with self-motivation and many congratulations to the countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Hundreds of good wishes.
Today is an opportunity to serve, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Jesus Christ said, 'The poor don't want our recognition.'
St. Luke specially says, "Jesus not only serves the poor but also appreciates the service done to the poor. "This is the real empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave a lot, but the widow gave them everything.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Banaras, the desert of Malaviaji.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Care Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre being built there will be very useful not only for Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birthday of our former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contributions of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have laid the nation's glory for the ultimate power.
As a party leader, as a Lok Sabha member, as a minister and as a Prime Minister, Atal ji established a great ideal.
On the occasion of Atal ji's birthday, I bow to him and pray to God for his health.
As an activist, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are illustrating.
I shared an old video this morning when I played the film and when I saw that video, I was fortunate to share the privilege of attending the years of Atal ji's love as a small worker.
Today, in Christmas, the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes as a Christmas gift.
In a way, this scheme was launched on the second day of November.
There has been an atmosphere of excitement all over the country, whether it is village or city or educational, whether it is cashless or illiterate, how cashless payments can be made, how to purchase goods without money.
Everyone wants to learn and learn.
In order to promote this, to strengthen mobile banking and to become an e-payment habit, the Government of India is launching encouraging schemes for consumers and small traders.
This is not only for a day but it has been going on for 100 days since its inception.
Every day, fifteen thousand people receive a thousand rupees.
For hundreds of days, millions of families are going to receive a prize of crores of rupees and you deserve a prize when you use digital payment methods like mobile banking, e-banking, rubber card, UPI, USD.
Digi-Dhan Business Scheme is mainly intended for traders.
This scheme is meant for all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Therefore, those who purchase more than Rs. 50 and less than 3000 will receive such awards.
Those who buy more than three thousand rupees will not receive this present.
The poorest of the poor can get a feature phone with USD, normal phone, goods, goods and money, so they can be the beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the gift scheme.
I know that the next youngsters will be aware of these things and if you ask them, they will tell them everything, you will have children studying in your family and in 10 and 12, and they will tell them very well.
It's as simple as you send messages on a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, knowledge about how to use technology, how to do e-payment and how to make online payment is being expanded very fast in the country.
In the last few days, cashless trade, i.e., rupeeless trade, has increased by 200-300 times.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The business community can well guess how big this decision is.
Digital payment trading entrepreneurs, while encouraging online payment systems in place of notes in their businesses, will also facilitate income tax.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
Someone has said that the Government of Assam has decided to grant 10 discount on payment of Digital Employment and License Fees.
The branches of Gramin Banks are receiving at least two digital transactions between January and March, with their 75 customers, as a gift of Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
As on 31st March, 2017, 100 Digital Transaction villages will be provided with Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transmission (UPDT) from the Government.
They also announced the Digital Krishi Shiromani Yojana for the farmers and will provide Rs. 5000 to the first 10 farmers who will be fully digitally paid for the purchase of seed and fertilizer.
In this regard, I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate all the governments for such initiatives.
Several organisations have adopted successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
Focusing on fertilizers, the GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited, focused on fertilizers, has set up a thousand POS machines in fertilizer vendors for the convenience of farmers and 5 lakh lacs of salaried fertilizers have been distributed through digital payments to 30,000 farmers within a few days.
The most interesting thing is that in comparison to last year, GNFC's fertilizer sales increased by 27 percent.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters have made great strides in startups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technologies and new projects, our youth should give greater importance to this sector.
So, we can become a partner by taking all our might to the nations blood and corruption drive.
My dear countrymen, every month I ask people to share their views and tell you what to say.
Thousands of comments received by MyGov and NarendraModi App this time were about to withdraw 80-90 per cent from the fight against corruption and black money.
Some have given a detailed account of the difficulties and inconveniences faced by people.
Another companion wrote that it was so good for the country's good, so sacred, however, all sorts of lying and all new ways of betrayal are found.
I am grateful to the people for writing so many letters and helping me.
A feeling like Guru Mani Kawl has written appears in every corner of the country.
We can all recognize it.
When people suffer, when they suffer, who are the people who don't feel pain
I feel the same pain you have.
I am convinced that it is impossible for the people to stand together and that the blessings of the people are the image of God and that the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude and gratitude to the people for taking part in this mass movement against corruption and black money.
The law is the same for everyone.
Whether it is an individual or an organisation or a political party, all must follow the law.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and black money are trying their best to find out the shortcomings of the government.
This government is for the common people.
He is constantly trying to find out the opinions of the people.
What is the problem of the people, what is the problem of the law, what is the problem and what is the solution
As an ever-encompassing and emotional government, the aim is to reduce the sufferings of the people by looking at how many laws have to be amended and considering the comfort of the people.
On the other hand, I said it was an extraordinary battle, on the eighth day.
For 70 years, all powers have come together in black money deals that are full of betrayals and corruption.
What's their strength
When they are determined to fight such people, they too have new ways of defeating the government.
When they adopt new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
You'll give me ten - because it's decided to disarm corrupt people, fraudsters and blacksmiths.
On the other hand, all kinds of liabilities are being carried out and all new methods are discovered and other information letters received from many.
In this regard, I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to my dear countrymen.
The number of information that is available in the government system is many times more than that of the common man.
Success is mostly coming, it's because the common people are awake.
Can anyone imagine the danger that the vigilant people of my country are facing to bring such weaknesses to light
They say, "Modiji, don't weaken, don't stop, don't stand, don't stand, don't stand, don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go.
I would like to especially thank those who have written this letter because they have faith and blessings in their letters.
I took it out, created a strong Benami Property Act.
In the days to come, the law will also start working on it.
Whatever you have to do for the good of the nation, for the good of the nation, it will be a priority.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I have said that in spite of these difficulties, our farmers have broken the records of the last year regarding farming.
It is a good idea for the agriculture sector.
In the last few days, India has been proudly nurtured in many fields in the world economics and as a result of the constant striving of our people, India's rise in global rankings is seen through different indicators.
India's rank has risen in the World Bank's Doing Business Report.
According to the Global Investment Report issued by the Dutch newspaper, Indias ranking in the Top Prospective Host Economics For 2016-18 is third.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have moved up 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and the Logistics Performance Index of the World Bank has increased by 19 ranks in 2016.
India is progressing at a rapid pace despite several other reports.
However, it gives a lot of pleasure to see some good things happening in this situation.
The government is committed to the people with disabilities.
I personally made an effort to speed up this move.
I aimed at achieving the rights and dignity of Divyangjans.
Our divyang brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and faith when we won four medals at the Paralympics.
They not only elevated the pride of the country but also surprised the people with their talents.
Our divyang brothers and sisters are an invaluable wealth and power like every citizen of the country.
I am very happy that after passing this Act for the betterment of the people with disabilities, I will increase the opportunities for Divyangjan to get employment.
Reservation limit for government jobs has been increased to 4.
Under this Act, special departments have been created in respect of education, other facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities.
It can be assumed from the fact that in the last two years, the government has organized 4,380 shibirds in the last two years and 5,000 sisters with disabilities have been distributed to the Divyangjans at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
The new legislation has been passed by the Government in accordance with the will of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyangjans were seven types.
Thalassemia, Parkinson and dungeon have joined this group.
The news from the games over the past few weeks makes us all proud.
As Indians, it is natural for all of us to be proud.
The Indian Cricket Team has successfully achieved 4 percent success against England.
Some of these young sportspersons were appreciative.
Test captain Virat Kohli gave good leadership along with good batting.
Indian Cricket Team offshore bowler R.
The Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
Junior Hockey team won the World Cup after 15 years.
Many congratulations to the youngsters for this achievement.
This achievement is a good fortune for the Indian Hockey team.
Last month, our women were also surprised.
The Indian women's hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy and now a few days ago, the Indian women hockey team won the bronze medal at the 18th Asian Cup.
Cricket heartily appreciates all the players of the Hockey team.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month we were celebrating Diwali.
Some wrote poetry, some painted films, some painted cartoons, some made videos.
I mean, how many houses were turned into military posts.
I'm surprised to see how imaginative and outlooking these letters are when I see them.
With your participation, the book prepares for your imagination of the country's army and your perspective towards security forces.
A young man wrote to me, Majesty, all the festivals like Holi and Deepawali for our soldiers will be held on the border.
Every minute it's drenched in the thought of the country's security.
But you'll be reminded of the house on the occasion of celebrations.
But to be honest, it didn't happen this time.
It's a celebration, it's not at home.
It was a feeling that we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the soldiers, the army's strength grows 125 crore times.
A few days ago, all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to visit.
They were conferencing people who had panched Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in the Kashmir valley.
I got a chance to talk to them for a while.
However, it was quite natural that the situation in the valley, the legislation and the future of the children had come to an end when the conversation progressed.
I am very happy that I have fulfilled the promise made to me by all those rural headquarters from the Kashmir Valley.
They went to the village and even made the remotest people aware.
A few days ago, when the Board examinations were conducted, about 95 percent of the children from Kashmir participated in the examination.
So many children took part in the board exams that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
Addressing the nation at 8 pm on 8th November, the Prime Minister said that a great move to bring about change in the country will begin.
The more important it is, the more important it is to be implemented and I felt that in our normal life there would be difficulties.
I had said that it would take 50 days to come out of the impact of this decision and I had said that it would be a big decision to return to normalcy after 50 days.
This decision of 500 and 1000, such a large country, so many currency and millions of rupees, is being looked at at attentively across the world, all economists are analyzing and evaluating it.
25 billion people of India are trying to overcome the difficulties and succeed.
There may be a question mark before the world.
25 billion people of India.
There is a strong belief that this decision will succeed and our country will be transformed into gold.
It's the responsibility of the citizens here, of you and of you, that you can traverse this path of success.
All over the country, the Central Government, the State Governments, all the components of the Local Local Bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bankers, more than one lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are in the process of working day and night with full dedication.
In the midst of a variety of mental conflicts, they are very quietly treated as a patriotic mission and are working as an effort to transform it.
Starting in the morning, he works without even knowing when the night is over.
Despite all this trouble, the officers of the bank and the post office work.
When it comes to humanity, it seems they're two steps ahead.
A grown-up accident took place in Khandwa
Suddenly there's a need for money
It was a matter of great pleasure to know that he himself went to the groom's house and provided money for the treatment.
Numerous such stories can be found through daily television, media, newspapers and others.
They are trying to mislead the poor, encouraging them to deposit their accounts, or to do something else to save their blood.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said, "Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
From Tarali village in Taluk, Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
Thereby, people will be enthusiastic, and a cashless economy is very important for nation building.
I am with the country in this regard.
It is heartening to note that you have withdrawn the cases of 500 and 1000 cases.
I would like to thank you in your heart because nobody thought that you would make such a big step when you said it would be your day.
Withdrawing the files of 500 and 1000, he taught the blacks and corrupt people a good lesson.
Every Indian does not have a better day.
People from all over the world also learnt to say that the Chai Pai Church is being discussed.
But I didn't know she was married to the Chai Pe Church.
I came to know that on 17th November there was a marriage with Chai Pai Church in Surat.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea to all those who were married to her.
No celebrations, no food programmes - because of the withdrawal of the bills, the money suffered a bit.
People find the best ways in a dilemma.
People are finding their own ways.
Look at this change.
Big people with relations who don't want to ask them, they don't pay the exact amount, and they'll have a lot of money left.
If every municipality has 50 percent of the land.
However, this time, on the 8th of this decision, everyone ran away to shut down their old records.
3,500 crore have been liquidated in 47 cities this year.
You will be amazed and happy to hear it, and this week only thirteen thousand crores have been distributed.
There will be many examples like this that can have a direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are a strong bond of the economy of this country.
On the one hand, because of this new change in the economic system, all citizens are compelled to deal with it in the face of difficulties.
Under the Mudra Yojana, there is considerable progress in lending to them.
Under the Mudra Yojana, lakhs and crores of rupees have been given to such small people because crores of people are doing these small businesses and they are speeding up the trade of crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to have trouble with this decision.
But now our small merchants, using technology, mobile app, mobile banking, serving their customers through credit cards, and trading on the basis of trust.
I would like to tell this small businessman that you too have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
You can also download the upload of banks on mobile phones.
Put POS machines to use credit cards.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that this technology can be used in the entire business of your village.
No one can exploit you.
You, I know, the youngsters of my country liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know that you are very much involved in taking this matter forward in a very useful manner.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, my best friends.
This is a wonderful opportunity for us to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
Your eldest family, your parents, your parents, your uncle, your parents, may not know.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is.
It's normal for you, you use it.
Today, however, the country wants to do a great thing of a society that is not obscure.
It's true that a hundred percent of a society cannot be noticed.
But can't we change into a little noticed society
Once you start a little bit of social construction, there will be no unnoticed social structure far away.
You are aware of the opportunities for a society that is not obsolete, digital banking or mobile banking.
All banks are being provided online.
All banks in India have mobile apps.
All banks have their own tail.
Walter means e-Persons.
Various types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families in India have two cards.
The consumption of RuPay card has increased by 300 times since the date of 8th.
Like the prepaid card on mobile phones, prepaid cards are also available to spend money from the bank.
Not only this, technology is simplifying so it doesn't need smart phones.
I have stressed upon simplifying these arrangements.
All banks try it.
My young friends, despite all this, there's a big generation that doesn't know.
I know you're all working on this great thing.
I see your creative messages on the Watts App - Mudrakyas, poems, short stories, cartoons, new imaginations, funny things.
However, my dear young friends, I reiterate, I need your help in this regard.
Your mobile phones will have all the technologies for online expenses.
Moreover, teach at least ten families at least half an hour, an hour, two hours a day, how to use this technology, how to download the bank's upload, how to spend the money in your account, how to give it to the borrower.
Once you teach people how to use the RuPay card, the poor will bless you.
If we educate ordinary people, they will perhaps get rid of all worries.
I don't think it will take long for all the youth of India to come up with this thing.
Within a month, we can present a new India before the world.
You can do this on your mobile phone, go to ten houses a day, and connect ten houses a day.
I invite you, come on, not just support, but we'll be the commander of this change, we'll have to relax.
We will take this war to the forefront of corruption and bloodshed in the country.
The country carried out a revolution.
My dear young friends, I once again request you to take this initiative forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCCs and NSS to do this thing together.
Let's take this forward.
We have got the opportunity to serve the nation well.
You shouldn't miss this opportunity.
You must have seen that the most eminent artist of this century, Amitabh Safai Yojana, has been moving forward very enthusiastically.
Cleanliness seems to have spread beyond his roots and hence remembered his father's birth anniversary as well.
He has written a narrative of Harivansh Rai ji's poetry: "I am a silent body, a joyful mind, a comfortable life.
" (Mitti Kaa Man, Masti Kaa Man and Kshan Man Jeevan), his son Shri Amitabh ji's veins of cleanliness drives like blood.
He has written to me through the poetry of Harivansh Rai ji - a clean body, a clean mind, a clean India.
I respectfully bow to Shri Harivansh ji.
Thank you very much to all of you.
Diwali is celebrated in every corner of India with enthusiasm and joy.
India is a country celebrating 365 days in any corner of the country.
We have seen the courage to end non-cultural festivals.
The changes in festivals have been naturally adopted as per the needs of time and society.
Do it through festivals.
Our ancestors had linked these things with festivals in a scientific manner.
Today, the world is discussing the environment.
Whether it is trees or rivers or animals or mountains or birds, these are festivals that are responsible for all.
It means that even in our country there was a tradition of celebrating holidays with the bonds of Brahmanda and science.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, as I have said, our festivals are enlightened and enlightened.
This Deepawali Tamaso Maa Jyotirgamaya is a message from darkness to light.
All parts of the house are cleaned up.
We have to enlarge this habit and tradition.
Diwali is no longer confined to the borders of India.
In a way, Diwali is remembered and celebrated in all the countries of the world in one way or another.
Many governments and parliamentarians of the world are celebrating Diwali.
Whether it is eastern countries or western countries or developing countries, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the festival of Deepawali will be celebrated.
Canada's Prime Minister, Deepawali, has been shared in the film.
On the occasion of the Diwali celebrations in London, the Prime Minister organized a visit to all communities and participated in it.
What's in that picture...
Deepawali greetings to the Prime Minister of Australia, the Prime Minister has urged people of different cities of Australia to join the Diwali celebrations.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had visited New ealand the previous day.
He said that he needs to return to Diwali at a rapid pace.
Deepawali, this festival of light indicates that the world is going to be a catalyst to take the world from darkness to light.
Parents have to ask parents to stay closer to the adults when they break the burial of the children, take care of them without fault, and avoid accidents with little apprehension.
In our country, the Diwali celebrations will take a bit longer.
Chhath Puja Celebrations are a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
Whether I talk about Deepavali or of Chhath Puja, in fact it is an opportunity for all of you to convey your best wishes.
But it is also an occasion to express gratitude and thank the people of our country.
Our soldiers have sacrificed everything for our peace and peace because of the events that have taken place in the past few months.
When we all celebrate Diwali, how do our soldiers suffer, some on the desert, some on the Himalayas, some on the Himalayas, some on the Himalayas, some on the side of industrialists, some on the side of the airports...
How many responsibilities do you perform
Words, birds, squirrels, colorful, innumerable imaginations...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
I am happy, smiling and smiling because of you, the truth is that you sleep peacefully because of the gift of my freedom and joy, because I sleep peacefully, because you have the mountains, the emblems and the flower of India, and I salute you the same way and I salute you the same way as you.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani, who was filled with the houses of her parents and husbands, gave me a message on telephone.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am talking to Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers and sisters get a lot of encouragement through the launch of this Deepawali Message to Jawan.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in the army.
I mean, my whole family is full of soldiers.
Brothers and sisters, the border officers get very much encouraged and good messages, and everybody in the Army Circle gets encouragement.
Their families and their wives have sacrificed a lot with the Army Officers and Solgiers.
In a way, a good message is received for the entire army and I wish you Diwali.
My dear countrymen, we can see that the soldiers are not only on the border but also in every sphere of life.
In spite of natural calamities, in the face of a breach of law and order, in the face of enemies, in the face of daring to bring back the misguided youth our soldiers are working nationally in every sphere of life.
In the first instance, it was Sikkim, and now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will be in the same fashion every November.
The name of his village is Badhana.
He was there and there was talk about making toilets.
Some families found that due to financial hardships, toilets could not be constructed.
Vikas Thakur worked and gave 57 families a thousand rupees in their own pockets and gave them the strength to achieve cleanliness.
It gave Himachal Pradesh the power to make it Open Defecation Free.
In the jungles of Kerala, there is no way to reach wolves, and a village of tribals hardly reaches by walking all day long.
People don't even go there.
It has been decided that all the cadets, volunteers of National Service Scheme and engineering students will join hands to construct toilets there.
Things are going on in all the states at a fast pace.
Only a few things I've taken.
I congratulate all the citizens of these states for their contribution in eliminating the darkness of waste from the country as part of this noble cause.
My dear countrymen, the schemes of the government will be very high and if the second such scheme comes after the first project then it will have to leave the first project.
Normally, no one pays attention to these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always guided us.
You decide according to this criteria.
We have to face the awakening hopes of the poor of our country, which is the need of the hour.
Now there are toilets for girls and boys in schools.
It is no longer possible to be the 21st century and remain blind in the village.
Therefore, the programme of electrifying the village from darkness is progressing successfully.
Efforts are being made to provide a smoke-free life to 5 crore households.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable traders, milk sellers, smugglers etc. were caught in the grip of the gangsters.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account etc. are successful programmes for the release of robbers.
Deposit to Aadhar-Loude Bank (ALB) directly by way of direct transfer of funds to eligible persons
It's an opportunity for ordinary people to get rid of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who made India's unity a lifeline.
31st October is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb on one side, the birth anniversary of the dynamic personality of the unity of the country
I think he succeeded in it, and he united everyone together.
On the same day, we can say that Indira Gandhi was slaughtered and that was the fate of the country.
The cruelty of Sardar Saheb and Sardar Saheb on the occasion of the birth anniversary of that great man who lived his entire life for unity gives us a pain in history.
Stay away from the worries of others, from the acts of others, from the country and the country.
The journey of life of Sardar Saheb is a struggle for the farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb had an important role in bringing the freedom struggle to the farmers.
Now sometimes we hear the name Usul.
Even today, people outside India and outside India are familiar with all its products, but very few people are aware of the divine vision of Sardar Saheb that the idea of cooperative Milk Producers' Union was that Kheda district was known as Kera district at that time.
He stressed on this thought in 1942.
How it was, it appears to us as an integral part of the comfort and prosperity of farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb with pride.
On this Ekta Diwas, on 31st October, wherever we may be, we must remember Sardar Saheb and understand the concept of unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartika Purnima is a glimpse of this festival of Diwali and it is a festival of lights.
The knowledge and advice given by Guru Nanak Dev is a guide not only for Hindustan but for the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was service, honesty, good for all.
He made Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Laloo his colleague when he was immensely immersed in deformities, casteism and sensibilities.
Let us follow that enlightened lamp, which inspires us to abandon the differences, to do something against the differences, and if we want to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', who should be a better guide than Guru Nanak Dev
Guru Nanak Dev is also bowing down to this festival.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Diwali in the name of the soldiers of the country.
May your dreams and imaginations succeed in all things.
May your life be comfortable and peaceful.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 25th September, 2016
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you.
We have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector in recent days.
I salute all these heroes and pay homage to them.
The loss was lost to the son, the brother was lost, not only to those families who lost the husband.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're proud of our army.
Parents and politicians have a lot of opportunity to talk.
All parents want all schools and colleges to be fully functional.
The farmers want their crops and fruits to be brought to the markets across India.
I mean, we want to do the right thing.
Over the past few days, business has been going on well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace for our problems, the path of our progress and the path of development.
We need to scale new heights of visa for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find peace in all the problems together and will prove the right path for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the ancestors of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government will have to take some action to continue the law.
I would like to tell the security forces that our strengths and regulations are being utilised for the peaceful and comfortable lives of the common people of Kashmir and they should be followed properly by our security forces.
Occasionally, those who think differently than we think, take new opinions.
In recent times, I have got the opportunity to learn a lot from social media.
Every corner of India gets an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of all kinds of people, which encourages the strength of democracy.
Last day, a boy named Harshavardhan of class II presented a different thought to me.
He wrote, "After the terror attack in Uri, I felt very sorry I wanted to do something."
But I don't know what to do, but a little school like me can do.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative outlook.
But during the 1965 war, we were led by Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was excited, fury and patriotism.
Everyone wanted to do something, thought to do something.
Lal Bahadur Shastriji has worked very well to touch this emotional level of the country.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and inspired the common man of the country how he should work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Scientist showed that there could be other ways to show patriotism between bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi led the movement for freedom, when the struggle was going on, and when it seemed necessary for the movement to take a straight forward, there was a very useful way to put that power back to creative things in the society.
Let us and the armies fulfill their responsibilities, let the administrators discharge their duties, let all of us, our natives, all the stars play a constructive role in the spirit of patriotism, the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Karthik wrote to me on the Narendra Modi App, the alternates that went to participate in the paralysis wrote history, their performance was the victory of the Human Spirit.
Not only you two, but all of you in the country have embraced an emotional relationship with our sportspersons who have participated in the paralysis.
Perhaps more than sports, the Para Olympics has transformed the achievements of our sportspersons and the human vision of the Divine.
I will not forget the words of our victorious sister Deepak Malik.
When she won the medal, the sister said, I have defeated the disability through this medal.
These words have great power.
This time, 19 latitudes including three women from our country participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, Divyangjan's games are much greater than physical strength and sporting skills.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals in the highest ever achievement - two gold, one silver, one bronze, the second gold medal in the Paul Volt, after 12 years.
He lost his hand because of electric shock.
You can imagine how big a man would have done to win the second gold medal at the age of twenty-three and then at the age of thirty-three.
Mariane Tanquelu won the gold medal at the High Jump.
Tanquelu lost his right when he was just five.
Poverty did not interfere with his determination.
He's not living in a big city, nor in a middle-class family.
Whether she leads a life full of suffering or physical hardships, she has won medals for the country through determination.
If it's Lat Divamalli, it's rocked and rocked in a variety of successes.
Varun C.
Bronze medal was awarded at the Bhilai High Jump.
It is also important that in our country, in our society, we are inspired to look at the divyang brothers and sisters living in our neighbourhood.
Our sympathies must be awakened and our vision for Divyangjans must change and very few people are aware of the huge performance this time in the Paralympics.
A few days ago, the Olympics competition took place at the same place.
Is it possible for anyone to think that even the Divyangs have broken the records in the general Olympics
And this time too.
In the days to come, India is trying to create a smooth plan for the Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people I was there, people were surprised.
At that time I had the opportunity to release a book, which included success stories of the lives of some Divyangjans.
There were very enthusiastic events.
I believe that the establishment of World Record in the soil of Navsari in the Government of India is a very important thing.
Within 8 hours, 600 persons with disabilities were able to access machines.
I got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It means that the country has taken a hundred and fifty five crore steps towards cleanliness.
We have been able to see the results in the right direction and the results are so good and what is happening through some effort.
Whether it is the road or the bus stand or the rail or the school or the college or be it a religious institution, be it the hospital or be it the children or the elderly, the poor villages and the farmers and the women all play their part in the cause of cleanliness.
Friends from the media also played a creative role.
In order to respect the health and well-being of the ancestors, especially the mothers and sisters, the cerebral palsy should end in the open space.
So Open Defence Free (ODF) has begun a mass movement called Open Defecation Free.
A healthy competition is being held between the states and the states and between the districts.
The states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be successful in the path of salvation from the practice of open defecation.
Come on, let's move on with determination.
I would particularly like to present a scheme to the young friends who are using technology in the recent past.
Everyone has the right to know what peace is in your city in terms of cleanliness, for which the Indian government has given a number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we were celebrating the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
By calling this number in 1969, you will not only be able to understand the condition of construction of toilets but also apply for construction of toilets.
You're gonna benefit from it.
Moreover, a Swachhata App has been launched to know about Swachhata related grievances and resolution of grievances.
You should make maximum use of this, especially the new generation.
The Indian government has requested the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Fellows in the districts.
In today's era, hygiene is linked to cleanliness and hygiene is equally essential for it.
It must be part of the waste to wealth.
Therefore, with the Swachh Mission, we must turn to the West to Combost.
Fertilizer told the companies that they should be prepared to buy compost from waste.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, mayors and commissioners from all over the country are going to have detailed discussions on cleanliness and hygiene.
What can we do with technology
How do you get jobs
Discussions will take place on issues such as:
I see new news about cleanliness.
Recently, I was informed that students from Gujarat Technological University went to 107 villages and made awareness about the construction of toilets.
A team of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh, along with a team, travelled 2800 kms from Devprayag to Gangasagar in the Ganges and disseminated a message of cleanliness.
Every department of the Government of India has prepared a timetable for a year.
I urge the stakeholders to engage in the work done by these departments without any hesitation in their respective areas.
All about cleanliness has been going on recently.
Initially, 73 cities were surveyed and sanitation coverage was presented to the public.
Now it's the turn of 500 cities with a population of more than a million.
This time we are behind, and next time we will have a confidence in every city that we will do a little better.
This coming October 2 is the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It's been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission started.
It will also illuminate the lamp of Diwali at the house of the poor and this time it will be on Sunday, 2nd October.
Wouldn't you like to join yourself in removing waste in a parade
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we will resolve to do something serious for the country.
Joe of Giving Wheels are going to be held in different cities from 2nd to 8th October, 2018 in collaboration with the CEOs.
It is aimed at delivering food items, clothing to the needy.
Today is the centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
The universal, universal, universal, intellectual principle is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poorest of the poor benefit from development
Let us focus on how the poor can benefit from the development of the society, the laws and everyone's attention.
I salute His Excellency Pandit Deendayal Upadhyayaji, who was a source of inspiration for all of us and a rich man of our fortunes.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the occasion of Vijayadashami.
I have tried my best not to celebrate the work done by the Mann Ki Baat government.
This Mann Ki Baat should not be a program of political turmoil and accusations.
How do I get inspired by the common man in this country
That is, Mann Ki Baat is not a debate 15-20 minutes ago, but a new opportunity for social transformation.
Anyone else will be more happy than this.
English rendering of the text of PMs address in Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 25th August, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the birthday of Hockey wizard Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
He played an important role in winning gold medals in Hockey for India at the Olympics in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of us like cricket have heard of Bradman's name.
He said about Dhyan Chand that His Scores Gols License (He receives Gols as he does).
Dhyanchandji Sportsman Spirit was a living example of patriotism and patriotism.
Once upon a time in Kolkata, a opponent hit Dhyanchand's head with a hockey stick.
So there was 10 minutes left to finish the game.
Dhyan Chand said that in 10 minutes, three rounds were laid and the reply was made by the Gols.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time comes for Mann Ki Baat, several suggestions are received on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
Full of diversity.
But this time everyone wants to say something about the Rio Olympics.
I look forward to urging the common citizens to be so close to the Olympics, so much awakening and asking the Prime Minister of India to say something about it.
There is so much love and awakening among the citizens of India regarding sports and not cricket.
Our daughters have once again proved that they are not behind anyone in any way.
It seems that girls from all over India have taken up a mission to make India proud.
Shekhar Thakur wrote in MyGov that we could have performed better in the Olympics.
He wrote, "Dear Modi ji, for the first time we have won two medals in Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
Our parents still focus on studies and academic issues.
Society still considers sports to be wasting time.
This thinking needs to be changed.
We need to boost the spirit of society.
Nobody can do this better than you.
We can't deny that we can't perform the same thing as we hoped.
In some cases, our sportspersons showed a good performance in India, however, they could not expect a good performance from here.
We have only two medals in the medal list.
But if you don't get a medal, you can see that in many ways our films show a good performance.
You see, our AbhinavBindraji was in the fourth position in the shooting and he lost his medal at a very small distinction.
This is what happened in Tennessee about Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopane's pair.
We performed well in the athletics.
For the first time in 32 years, the simplest Babar has qualified for the Track and Field final.
It is heartening to note that after 36 years, the female hockey team has reached the Olympics.
For the first time in 36 years, the male has reached Knockout stage in Hockey.
Our team is very powerful.
Many sportspersons like Aditi Ashok, Datu Bhokanal and Anu Das were good at their performance.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we do as we have done, perhaps we'll be disappointed again.
We'll prepare a roadmap on how we can be better.
2020, 2024, 2028.
We have to think of what we can do in the field of sports and what we can do for each state.
States should choose one or two types of their own which can show strength.
I also urge the Sports Associations to conduct neutral analysis.
I appeal to every citizen of India to send my opinion on the subject of which I am interested.
We are fully prepared.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is Teachers' Day.
I spend a lot of time with students on Teachers Day for years and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from the little kids.
For me, 5th September was Teachers' Day and Teachers' Day.
But this time I have to attend the G-20 Summit, so I have decided to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
Teachers have as much place as your mother has in life.
I've seen teachers who are more concerned about their own.
They dedicate their lives to their pupils, to their students.
Now, after the Rio Olympics, we have heard about Pullela Gopichand.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pulla Gopichand, his dedication to his penance and sports, his way of rejoicing in the success of his students.
We have always felt the contribution of teachers in our lives.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, paid floral tributes to Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji's birthday is being celebrated as Teachers Day.
I remember many stories of my teachers, because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
He still seems to teach me in the classroom.
I can say he's still giving me the Currents Course.
In this nineteenth year, his handwriting will be wonderful if he writes such beautiful letters at this age.
My letters are very bad and I feel a lot of respect when I see someone's good letters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Ganesh is approaching.
The Ganesh changes the divisions... let there be no divisions in the lives of our country, our society, our family and each one of us.
Lokmanya Tilak started the Ganesh Festival, making this religious festival an opportunity to awaken the country.
Even today, Ganesh Festival is being organized not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
All the youngsters will make preparations and will be very enthusiastic for this event.
Some people are still trying to emulate the emotions that the world leader has put forward.
He will hold discussions on public issues, hold articles, organise flower festivals.
In view of this, issues touching society are presented in an artistic manner.
In a way, Ganesh Festival is a big campaign for public education.
Lokmanya Tilak Swaraj has inspired us to be our birthright.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
The festival gives a new life to the lives of individuals and society.
Life is impossible without a festival, but it has to be shaped according to the time.
This time many people have specially written to me about the festival of Ganesh and Durga Puja.
Ganesh ji made of mud in the village pond.
The idols made of the Plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment.
He and others have expressed a lot of pain.
I also urge you to build the statues of Ganesh and Durga Devi and return to our ancient traditions.
Ganesh is separative.
So we shouldn't make a segregated Ganesh.
I don't know how much you're going to take, but I'm not the only one who says it.
Many such organisations work hard and propagate to create a mud-like mud.
Eco-friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
If we make the river in the lake with a rope, it's not going to be harmful to the environment.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will proclaim Mother Teresa on September 4th and September 4th.
Mother Teresa used her life to serve the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud that Mother Teresa, who served the poor throughout her life, is being holy.
The Government of India is sending an official delegation led by the Minister of External Affairs, Smt. Sushma Swaraj to the 125 crore Indians on this occasion of 4th September.
We get to learn something from saints, sages, sages, sages and great men.
We keep earning, learning and doing something good.
My dear countrymen, how much change happens when development becomes a peoples movement.
Democracy is considered to be another form of God.
During the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and connect people with it.
On 20th May, a meeting of the Village Heads of Government was held in Allahabad on the banks of River Ganga.
I convey my best wishes to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for this initiative.
I thank the Chief Ministers and the five States for the great pledge to clean the Ganga by harnessing the Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, sometimes something touches my mind and I am particularly honoured to those people who have formed those ideas.
On July 15th, more than one and a half lakh students from more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
They told their parents in that letter that they need toilets and toilets in their homes.
They asked them to make toilets if they didn't celebrate their birthday this year.
This is what inspires us.
A sixteen year old girl from Kopal district of Karnataka, Mohammad, took a pledge against her family.
The family was not financially capable.
And the child stood firm in his stead.
The village chief, Mohammad Shafi, who knew that he was performing Satyagraha for the cleanliness of Mohammad, arranged for Rs. 17,000 and made toilets within a week.
The strength of the girl Malama and the village chief like Mohammad Shafi deserves to be praised.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have made it their target.
This information will be obtained on the website.
The awards will be given to the winners on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October, 2018 in the Short Films event.
I want to tell the TV channels that you too should urge and compete for making a film like this.
The creativity and waste-building will be strengthened, new seals will be obtained, new methods will be known, new motivations will be given.
All this will happen through the collaboration of people and ordinary artists, whether a big studio or a big camera is required to make a film.
It may seem that the President has to launch a radio channel.
But it's not a normal radio channel, it's a big step.
We have Bangladesh in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal still exist with the same cultural heritage.
Here Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Betar share their programmes and people from both sides enjoy the programmes of Akashwani.
The contribution of aeronautics is immense in building personal relations.
The President of India inaugurated the event.
I also thank Bangladesh for their cooperation with us in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to Akashwani for their participation in overseas.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of becoming Prime Minister, but I am a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart.
Such emotional events give new energy and inspire, which inspires the people of India to do something for them.
Millions and millions of mothers of India who have laid down their lives to help others with their hardships.
My dear countrymen, we suffered due to shortage last year, but this month of August was filled with difficulties due to continuous rains.
There have been frequent floods in some parts of the country.
State governments, central governments, local institutions, social institutions and citizens have tried their best to do whatever they can.
But I heard some other news about the floods and some other news, which needs to be remembered.
The month of August this year will recall the strength of unity and how big a transformation can be achieved if we move forward together.
The GST Act was passed by the Parties with strong political dilemma in August 2016, unanimous parties, nearly 90 parties across the country and all the parties in the Parliament together to oppose each other.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is an example of how big a thing can be achieved if all parties move together in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties in the country spoke in one voice about the events in Kashmir and the situation there.
I believe in the power of 21 billion people.
This morning, I had the opportunity to spend some time with the youngsters of Delhi.
I hope that in the coming days, all the youth of the country will immerse themselves in the colours of the spirit of Olympics.
The whole world will be in the games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons wherever we are.
I will surely send messages to sportspersons on the website Narendra Modi App.
Come, let us all together try to increase the dignity and dignity of all our parents and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion of talking to you about Rio Olympics, you can hear a poem from a student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, who is interested in poetry.
There will be many other poets like this, they must have written such poems, some may have written some more, some may have done some musical discipline of poems.
I would like to share the poems sent by the sun with you.
Mr. Angid Karkey reminded me of the birthday of former President Abdul Kalam.
It is, therefore, inspired Mr. Angina to write down what steps your government has taken to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The coming centuries will be guided by technology.
If someone tries to capture it, it will appear in new disciplines somewhere far away, and if we want to take technology together, we must be ready to get ahead of it.
Therefore, we should adopt research and innovation as the roots of technology.
Innovation, periment, entrepreneurship etc.
If we organize the second generation of Net Generation innovation, our children will join it.
That is why the government of India had started the Atal Tinkering Abbs.
10 lakhs will be provided to schools under this programme and another Rs. 10 lakhs will be provided for the operational cost of the next 5 years.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly related to innovation.
If we can build self-sufficient incubation centres as much as we need, we can create a systematic mechanism for start-ups to experiment with innovation.
Construction of new incubation centres and upgradation of old ones is essential.
We have to face many problems in our daily life.
If you get sick, you want to recover quickly, so you eat something antibiotic.
You might be free for a while, but you must stop taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
We don't have antibiotics until the doctor writes.
We don't have to travel in such shortcuts.
Years will pass for this war, new drugs and scientific research.
Until then, these diseases continue to create new problems.
Therefore, we need to be cautious in this regard.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Eat 15 pills, the doctor will tell you to eat it in five days.
You have to complete the course by taking pills every day as per the doctor's instructions.
Even if you take more medicine than necessary it will be beneficial for the bacteria .
So, the number of pills that the doctor prescribes for the day is a big thing to follow.
In medical terms it's called antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, it is necessary to follow the rules to use them as they use antibiotics.
Our government is committed to protecting antibiotic resistance.
You might have seen a red line on the surface of the data on antibiotics that are being sold today.
I urge you to take care of it.
I would like to add another topic to health.
I am concerned about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
It cannot be said that what kind of difficulties are they facing during and after pregnancy, deficiency of blood, congenital infections and high blood pressure.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission, that is, Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan over the last few months.
As part of this mission, all pregnant women are provided free medical check-ups at government health centres every month on the 9th of every month.
I would primarily urge the genologists not to offer this service free of cost for the poor mothers on the 9th of this month.
I'm sure you'll be part of it.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
Societal discussions are taking place in this regard, both in the country and the world.
India has been focusing on this thing for centuries.
Kurukshetra is discussing the trees of Lord Krishna on the battlefield.
NASTI Aayog has said that there is no medicinal herbs and no medicinal herbs.
The tree seeks to tread the tree in the entire world like its own treasures.
So parents, who want their own good, must grow good trees and protect them like monsters.
Whether it is Geeta or Shukracharya or the Discipline Mountain of Mahabharata, some of these ideals are of today's generation.
A few days ago, I noticed a girl from Pune, Sonal, for example.
It touched my mind.
Trees are fulfilling the responsibilities of colonial rule in the entire world, says the Mahabharata Discipline, Soneel has taken a mission to fulfil the aspirations of not only her parents but also of the society itself.
Kishen Ghandu, a village named Narayanpur in Kejunar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, married his grandfather Sonal in a very inspiring manner.
I saw the picture in social media.
I didn't see the groom's wedding party, but rather I wondered that it was only plants that were visible.
It was a picture that touches the mind.
Sonal is a graduate, and this idea is hers.
You will see how excellent natural love has been expressed by gifting Mavin Thais to those who come to the wedding.
In other words, Sonal's marriage has become an eternal story of natural love and I wish Sonal and Mr. Mahatrejee all the very best for this innovative endeavour.
This can be transformed into a natural manifestation of the tree corridor.
I am told that on 1st July this year, the Maharashtra government has planted about 1. 5 crore trees across the state and decided to plant 3 crore trees next year.
It is not easy to plant 25 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan know how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has decided to increase its green cover by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat has a brilliant tradition of the Forest Festival.
This year, several names like Gujarat Maav Forest, Ekta Forest, Martyrdom Forest and others have been observed to plant millions of trees in the jungle festival.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela in the context of South Africa.
When we hear the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoeni Settlement and the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I had the privilege of travelling by train from Pieter Maritburg station on the journey of Mahatma Gandhi, which was the quest for making a Mohandas Mahatma Gandhi.
I would also like to say this time that I have got the opportunity to meet many great personalities who have laid down their lives throughout their youth for equality and equal opportunity in society.
Nelson Mandela fought shoulder to shoulder and spent 20-22 years in prisons with him, thus he laid down his youth.
I am fortunate to meet the great personalities of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Kathara, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Besos and Mr.
After such a great penance, I couldn't see the feelings of achieving, acquiring and becoming.
I have seen in them a manifestation of the duties laid down in Geeta.
There is no spell of equality and equal opportunity for any society and government.
Their thoughts are very natural.
They told me about an incident, a sculpture from Bangalore.
I read in an article the story of a woman who was cheated on a chit mail and lost 11 lakh rupees and then committed suicide.
As a woman, I feel sorry for her family.
I'd like to know what you're saying about this kind of chit-ford mail.
In a few minutes, he lost everything.
Sometimes you're being misunderstood.
They're gonna be so nice.
But I had a very pleasant experience in this past.
A few students from Aligarh came to me.
The boys and the girls were very excited.
They came as a big album and enjoyed their faces.
A artistic painting was conducted at the station.
Moreover, in the rural areas, the plastic bottles and oil utensils found in the midst of silk dumps have been collected and planted and planted virtual gardens.
And on one side of the railway station, this vertical garden has been built in plastic bottles and given a new impression.
My dear countrymen, the age of festivals has come in our country in the years to come.
Just imagine, don't you give a sister a gift that protects her life Not only this, there will be women who cook food in our house.
She'll be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the true meaning of Rakshabandhan.
My dear countrymen, many of us are born in an independent period.
I was the first Prime Minister to be born in the post-independence era.
May the entire nation be filled with the zeal of our freedom fighters, let us reiterate our softness of freedom once again.
Let's all create this atmosphere.
And the Independence Day celebrations should not be a government programme but it should become a programme for the people of the country.
We must celebrate our own like Diwali.
I would like you to do something good in your patriotism and inspire yourself.
Definitely send pictures of it to the Narendra Modi App.
Creating an atmosphere of its own in the country.
You might want that thing in your mind to be presented from the Red Fort with the same vigor.
As your representative, as your Chief Servant, I invite you, if I want to say this thing from the Red Fort.
I don't want the Prime Minister to be the Prime Minister of the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the platform of technology is comfortable enough for you to reach out to me.
I am grateful to Akashwani for presenting Mann Ki Baat in local languages at 8 PM.
Several of these suggestions are helping me in the work of my government.
Perhaps it's a week to start the rainy season, so we're worried too.
Almost all parts of the country are experiencing the scorching heat of summer.
Climate change enhances such problems.
Trees were cut down.
In a way, humans destroy nature and destroy themselves.
5th June is World Environment Day.
Discussions on environment are taking place around the world.
During the last few days, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and the Himalayan valleys have become firecrackers.
I have had the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of 11 states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha, who have been suffering from Summer Industries.
I listened carefully to every country.
Normally, there has been no such subtle discussion in this regard regarding the amount normally allocated by the Central Government and how much it has been spent.
In a way, the fact that water conservation, environment, drought reduction, animal conservation and drought-affected areas have shown excellent work for the entire country was also a surprise to the officers of the Indian government.
I told the NITI Aayog, "Assimultaneous models must be adopted and implemented in other States.
Some states, especially Andhra and Gujarat, have fully utilized the technology.
I would like to take the successful experiments of the States to other areas through NITI Aayog.
In such cases, Jan Bhagidari is a key pillar of success.
Perhaps, if there is a comprehensive plan, we can make considerable changes in the time limit by using appropriate technologies.
Irrigation is also important.
Their target is to add 2-3 lakh hectares of land each year to micro-irrigation.
Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan has been implemented in Chhattisgarh.
In Madhya Pradesh, about 22,000 ponds have been added under the Balram Talab Yojana, which is not a small figure.
They were aimed at water conservation and in some states, small water conservation schemes were implemented for 10 and 20 kilometres.
It's a good experience.
I would like to say that not a single drop of the rain water received by June, July, August and September will not be wasted.
We should now think about what should be the place for water conservation and how it should be.
God has provided water according to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
We'll be reluctant to see a lot of water, and we'll worry when it's rainy season, how long can it be
During the last few days, the media was talking about the problems of water availability.
I am sure that the media will provide guidance for water conservation, expand its operations, and the media will also participate in ways to address water scarcity.
I invite them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
We have to create a transparent India.
Our schemes have to be carried out in every corner of India in a uniform manner without any concessions.
We have to make little changes in our old attitudes.
But today the situation has completely changed.
The world looks like a cashless society.
Electronic technologies can be used to send and manage money from all over the world.
Together, we can pretend to be a monetary society.
Perhaps you have seen that RPA has been given CARD along with Jan Dhan accounts.
The Credit Debit Card will be used in the coming days.
No need for money, count or anything from the pocket.
This is the Bank on Mobile - the Universal Payment Interface Banking Transaction (PIBT) which can transform the systems.
With your mobile phone, Money Transaction will be very simple.
Perhaps, if it's easy, RPA CARDs don't always have to walk with them.
It has also activated the post offices for banking services.
Illegal transactions will continue forever.
The effect of blood will be very low.
So, my countrymen, I want- let's start this.
Once we start, we can easily move forward.
We might have thought a few decades ago that a mobile phone would be in our hands.
That's how we turn money into a society.
It would have been better if it hadn't happened without a footprint.
My dear countrymen, sometimes when the Olympics Championship comes or when the game starts, we are very much behind the gold medals.
If I get the silver.
In order to promote our sportspersons to participate in the Rio Olympics, each one has to increase their morale and enthusiasm in their own way.
Over the past week, we were all worried about the outcome of elections, especially the outcome of Assam.
Encouraging sportspersons and encouraging our sportspersons, such a thing gives everyone great courage and strength.
India has to place its own seal before the world in the spirit of sportsmanship without rolling everybody in the rocks of chivalry.
Throughout the year, the results of students studying in classes 10 and 12 are being followed one by one.
There is a lot to do in life to tell those who have not been able to win.
A Mr. Gambhir in Madhya Pradesh.
Gharib Patel presented a great deal of trouble to me.
33 per cent of the markets were not happy.
Everyone was telling me I lost 90 percent of the 4 marks.
I don't know what I felt like putting a weight on my mind.
I carefully read your letter.
I think, perhaps, this pain is not yours.
Like you, there are millions and millions of students, because there is an atmosphere like this.
Can we lead society towards satisfaction and peace by finding unhappiness in all matters
Your relatives, colleagues and friends are 89.
I have written to Anand Giri Goswami from Jodhpur about this issue.
He says people in my neighborhood don't approve of our results.
I don't remember all the poems if I were a little better... but I had written a poet a long time ago, and I painted a painful picture of life.
Some said it would be better if it was yellow instead of blue.
Some say it would have been better if it were there instead of putting this record here.
Well, it would have been better if one or two of them had dried up after seeing the picture of my pain.
Everyone was talking about Dutchup.
Like you, millions of students are like this.
You are capable of fulfilling the needs of the people.
I'd like to tell you that you don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everyone expresses his needs.
But stay firm in your position and try to fulfil a little more.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability, then the new goal will never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of success is the foundation of great success.
The lack of satisfaction derived from success is not a step towards success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of Santoor's instrument.
There was a time when Santoor Vadodara was associated with folk music in the Kashmir valley.
But a person named Pandit Shiva Kumar embraced it as the greatest instrument in the world.
Shehnai- our musical world was in very limited places.
It was mostly found in the darbars of the Maharajas at its doorstep.
But when Ustad Bismillakhan took over in Shehna, it became an universal musical instrument.
It is true that the cost is very low to prevent illness, but if illness comes, the cost of recovery is very high.
If someone can help the poor, it's only for cleanliness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
There has been a special credibility with Yoga all over the world and there is respect and faith in it.
Yoga offers the power to lead a balanced life to a world of stress.
Every person should spend 20-25 minutes or 30 minutes in his lifestyle.
For this purpose, we have to motivate ourselves on 21st June.
Sometimes a social environment becomes the cause of change in the life of a person.
I hope you will take the lead wherever you are on June 21.
If you are required in your neighbourhood, in your cities, in your villages, in your schools, in your institutions, you should follow it even in your office.
Start for a month from now, and look, you'll be participating in it on June 21.
I will be attending a programme in Chandigarh this time.
My dear countrymen, I have been continuously connecting with you through this programme Mann Ki Baat.
I gave you a mobile number a long time ago, and you could hear the Mann Ki Baat by calling it Mrs.
But it's made more simpler.
You just need four times more to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
If you call Missed in this number 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat in any language anywhere.
My dear countrymen, once again my greetings to you.
Don't forget the water I told you.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is an occasion for you and I to wait and arrive.
This time too many letters, comments, phone calls, many stories, suggestions, motivations...
People were discussing books on science, technology, innovations, history, culture, business, life history, etc.
People asked me to discuss other books.
But I'll have to say I can't move time to read a lot of books.
Let us initiate a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App and write and discuss it whenever we read a new book.
You can propose a name for this book corner.
I would like this book corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Many experts have made good efforts in the field of water conservation.
People share knowledge about traditional methods.
For instance, the zeal and enthusiasm of the villagers in the village Arra Karam in Ormanji Block, just a short distance from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become an example for everyone.
The beautiful state of north-eastern India, Meghalaya has become a land of its own water.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, very few water is required but farmers are being given priority so that they dont have to suffer losses.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for discussing with the farmers, removing them from traditional farming and inspiring them to cultivate less water.
It's time for festivals.
Festivals also take place during festivals.
These fairs should also be used for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fairs.
The message of water conservation can be given in a very good manner in these fairs, be it exhibitions, street plays, we can reach the message of water conservation along with the festival in a very simple way.
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm.
Especially the achievements of children and their actions give us new energy.
So I want to talk about some kids.
They are Nidhi Baipad, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Priti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranyatesh Ganguli, Hrithik Alamada.
I'll talk about them and fill your minds with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that the word "cancer" is something that scares the world.
After winning the game, the champions won the medal.
But it was a rare opportunity for them to become champions before participating in the competition.
That's the champions of life struggle.
The World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
The competition was held in the field of shooting, chess, swimming, run, football etc.
All these champions of our country have won medals in the tournament.
Some of these sportspersons have won medals in more than one.
My dear countrymen, you must have been proud of India's success in space beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan 2.
From Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Sanjeev Haripura, Kolkata and Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana and P.
2019 is a good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched ASAT in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this.
On July 22, the country was proud to move from Chandrayaan 2 Sriharikota to the atmosphere.
The launch of Chandrayaan 2 has filled people with pride, enthusiasm and joy.
The Chandrayaan 2 mission is unique in many ways.
You will be happy to note that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But it must always be remembered that we have the ability to survive it.
I have great hopes that Chandrayaan will motivate the youth of two countries to turn to the world of science and innovation.
Finally, science opens the path of development.
On the surface of the moon, we are awaiting the launch of Lander Wickremesinghe and Rover Pragyan as a nectar for September.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with my country's students, friends and youngsters about a very attractive competition.
I would like to invite the youngsters of the country to the uiz Competition and the curiosity related to space, Indias science mission and scientific technologies will be the key to addressing issues.
I would like to appeal to young friends and students to participate in this issue and make it attractive and enjoyable and unforgettable through your participation.
I specially urge schools, guardians and enthusiastic principals and teachers to make every effort to make their school a success.
Encourage all schools to participate in this.
This will be a historic event in their lives for students who are successful.
But we need to take up this issue, get the maximum marks, be successful.
Inspire more and more friends.
Dear friends, you must have noticed something.
Our Mann Ki Baat has accelerated the Swachhata Abhiyan from time to time.
When they performed their skills from the walls of over-bridges and schools to the huts, people joined them and it became a big step.
You must have seen how Prayag Raj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a major role in this regard.
It is our great need to develop the culture of waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move from waste to gold.
My dear countrymen, the last day I read a very attractive message on MyGov.
This commander belonged to Bhai Mohammad Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: It is a pleasure to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have participated actively in organizing the Back to Village for Community Mobility Programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
This programme was organized in June.
I am of the opinion that such programmes should take place every three months.
An online monitoring of the programme is also required.
This programme shows the immense zeal and enthusiasm of the people of Kashmir for joining the mainstream of development.
For the first time, a large number of officers have come directly to the villages and unaware of the villagers have come to their houses to understand the hurdles faced by them in terms of development.
I'm busy with how to increase the income of people.
Asked how the service of the administrators has impacted the lives of ordinary citizens, the villagers have openly expressed their concerns.
Discussions were also held on issues such as literacy, male ratio, health, waste management, water conservation, electricity, water, girl child education and issues of senior citizens.
Friends, this programme was not a government function like the officer travelling in the village all day long, but this time the authorities spent two days and one night in the Panchayat, which gave them the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added a lot of things to make this event even more attractive.
Under the leadership of Khelo India, Sports Competition for Children was organized.
He also distributed sports kits, job cards of National Employment Guarantee Scheme, ST, ST and ST certification etc.
This kind of programmes and peoples participation are being called by our brothers and sisters of Kashmir, Sad Governance, from which it is understood that the strength of progress lies beyond the strength of bombs and guns.
It is evident that those who want to hatred on the path of development and want to create obstacles cannot achieve their immense goals.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra, the winner of the Gyanpeeth Award, in his poetry, spoke about the glory of the month of Shravan.
In this, he said, "Hodige Madige Agyedu, the desert land of Magna, which separates the bonds between the prey and the water currents of the rain, the earth is immersed in its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages of India celebrate the Shravan month in their own ways.
In this season, when we look at the environment, we feel that the earth is covered with greenery.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, many observe fasting systematically and eagerly await the fertility of janmasthmi and nagapanchami.
During this period, Rakshabandhan Festival, a symbol of brother-in-law's love, has been going on.
On the occasion of Shravana, more than 4 years of devotees took part in the Amarnath Yatra this time.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh pilgrims visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days of this journey in 2015, more people participated in just 28 days this time.
I especially congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The people who return from the journey are driven by the enthusiasm and zeal of the people of the state.
All these are very helpful for the pilgrimage in the future.
On the other hand, heavy rainfall is very likely to occur in many parts of the country.
My dear countrymen, it is very difficult to decide where to start Mann Ki Baat and where to stop.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no dearth of festivals in our country.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country that enjoys economic security through festivals.
Festivals are an opportunity for economic stability to the poorest of the poor in the society.
You know I use technology very well, so I get a lot of knowledge.
Ganesh V.
Savesh Warker wrote to me that this season is a tourist season.
There are many national and foreign tourists coming here.
People celebrate Christmas holidays.
Sometimes we hear things getting disappointed from all corners of the country.
It is the strength of the nation that millions and millions of people do something good in their own way, just like the World Bank.
It creates new opportunities for education and employment.
When the entire world was attracted by Yoga and celebrated International Day of Yoga, we believed in the power of India and took pride.
This vision reflects in our minds when we see India's vast vision.
Today, the word Swachhta is heard in the houses.
People's participation in it is increasing.
That's a service.
I've made a little effort in my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear young friends, the first ever discussion on Start-up India and Start-up India was started in the Red Fort on 15th August.
Thereafter, it was discussed in the Government Departments.
Can India become a start-up capital
New start-ups and new innovations in the manufacturing sector, in the services sector, we can start agri-cultural hygiene.
It's wrong if you think so.
Youngsters from every corner of India are talented.
Start-up India and Start-up India should not be confined to just a few cities.
It should spread to every nook and corner of India.
I urge the state governments to expand this.
On January 16, I will discuss this with you with clearness.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions of people like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is being celebrated as the National Youth Festival on 12th January.
This year it is being celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th to 16th January.
A Small India will be created there - a Young India.
In a way, you can see the sting of dreams.
The power of decisions can be seen.
Can you share your suggestions on this Youth Festival with me
I hope this is the result of your initiatives.
Mr. President, thank you a thousand.
You're a person working in this field
So you can understand this, and you've suffered a lot of trouble.
Sometimes a handicapped, sometimes disabled, sometimes disabled, so many words.
Every word has its own significance.
This year, the Government of India has started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take it.
Have we started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
This will facilitate the development of all types of infrastructure and facilitate ease of doing business.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, ramps of railway stations, parking, lifts, braille scripts, they need innovation to facilitate them.
Technologies are needed, system requires sensitivity.
The effort has begun, and the people's participation is getting.
People love it.
The files shouldn't be stored before that.
In fact, the plans are for the common man and the armed forces.
Over the years, the Government of India has conducted an inquiry into how to benefit the rightful heirs of the schemes.
Subsidy is given to gas cylinders in our country.
It wasn't observed if they were keeping the data properly.
That's why the government has made some changes.
The mission is to bring subsidy to the bank account of the beneficiary directly through the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme through Jan Dhan Account integrating Aadhaar Card.
I am honoured to note that this is the worlds largest successful Director, Benefit Transfer Scheme, which has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
On the one hand, Aadhar Card Camps on the other, Jan Dhan Accounts on the other, and on the other, Centre and State Governments have been working together to create a list of beneficiaries and link them with bank accounts on Aadhaar.
Now the money is being directly credited to the workers' accounts at various places.
There have been complaints about the scholarship of the students and efforts have been made to solve them.
About 40 crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiary's accounts through various schemes.
About 30-45 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
My dear Indians, January 26 is the golden moment of the India Republic.
In the Parliament, two days were passed for a special discussion on the Constitution.
It was a good experience.
We are conscious of the greatest obligations that it is time to elect, and it is our duty to vote, through advertisements and wall-writings.
Why don't we talk about duties in everyday life, as in the election time
Can we observe the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar in a modest way on 26th January and hold discussions in schools, colleges, villages, cities and organisations on the basis of duties
If 125 crore people take one step after another and fulfill their duties then it will be an unchanging history.
At least we'll start discussions.
You might have got a chance to go somewhere.
Festivals have their own importance in social life.
The news of natural calamities continues to come from every corner of the world.
We have never thought or imagined these evils.
We are now experiencing the impact of climate change on a rapid scale.
The central government is rubbing the shoulders and working with them.
But in the face of such misery, we have to think about the need for change.
That's a good start.
Today, I received a message from Jalandhar in Punjab about Lakhvinder Singh ji, I am talking from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
"I was very happy to hear your question, Lakhvinder Singh.
The main reason for my happiness is that you are doing organic farming.
Moreover, with organic farming, you understand the problems of farmers.
But it is not right to think that this is just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of all of us Indians, we are following the traditional way of burning and disposing of crop residue.
First of all, we didn't know about such losses.
Everyone does, we do.
Secondly, I didn't train how to do this.
But your concern is correct.
But these aren't real.
The ruins of the crop are also valuable.
Secondly, they burn the surface of the Earth.
We can't survive, even if the heart is strong.
Likewise, the ruins of the harvest burn not only the ruins but also the skin of the Mother Earth.
Animals can also be utilized for their food, which also saves our planet.
Not only that, put the fertilizer from the same planet over there, it gives double profits.
Once I got the opportunity to talk to farmers who are cultivating bananas.
They shared their best experiences.
Hector had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand to change the ruins of the banana after harvesting.
The ruins of the banana will remain as long as the tractor brings those people who want to change them.
However, some farmers buried these ruins of banana into pieces of 6-8 inches on the ground.
Last time in 'Mann Ki Baathi' I talked about organ donation.
He also spoke about the helpline of 'Chathcha' for organ donation.
Film star Ravin Tandon and other eminent personalities participated.
We can save many life precious by organ donation.
In a way organ donation provides immortality.
When organs are moved from one body to another then that organ gets a new life and that life gets a new life.
What's greater donation than this
A National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation for Organ donors for patients waiting for transplantation started on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awakening in every region and in the true sense, the best possible assistance will be provided to the needy.
Everyone has to come forward for this.
As I have mentioned earlier, 3rd December is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Physically and mentally challenged persons belong to the unparalleled will and courage.
I feel sad when they're ridiculed.
We'll start crying when there's a little hardship.
Think of how they live, how light our pain feels.
How do they live
Their determination, their way of moving towards life, their zeal to make problems capable, is commendable.
Today, I would like to talk about Javed Ahmad.
He's 40, 42 years old.
In 1996, terrorists shot him in Kashmir.
Though he was a victim of militant guns, he was amazingly saved.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed and one part of the intestine was lost.
The spinal cord was severely damaged.
He's lost his ability to stand on his feet forever, and yet he doesn't give up.
The wound of terrorism didn't defeat him.
How to improve the affiliations of physically challenged persons, how to make arrangements in public places and government offices.
Is Javed's life capable of inspiring every corner of India
I specially remember the life of Javed Ahmad and his dedication to Tapaswi on 3rd December.
Due to lack of time, I am talking about Javed but in every corner of India, such inspirational lamps are rising.
Our country is big.
There's a lot of things that depend on the government.
More than one experience changes our perspective of government systems throughout life.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
Millions of people work around us like this.
What's the joy of seeing the sick with their friends
Are they participating in the comfort of society
I congratulate all those assailants of India who have worked like this in the name of 'Jamunami'.
In addition to discussing 'e' books, one of the youngsters should tell the students of classes 8, 9 or 10 in the nearby schools, what is happening here and what is happening there.
And, in fact, you are becoming a good teacher of a society.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you for nation building.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is concerned about climate change.
A friend who guided me to share this uncomfortable experience had sent me an ink to know and see.
But one thing they did wouldn't mean that other educated people wouldn't have thought.
They have been working with solar energy to provide light to the poor in their area.
They fought against darkness and distinguished their names.
They built a plant of solar lit rantles through a group of women.
Every month they are paying a rent of just 100 rupees per month to local resident goods.
We know what big people in the world are doing about climate change.
Thank you very much for the e-News.
But the beginning is very good.
In a short span of time, 66 lakh people have been provided with Rs. 40,200 crore (Rs.
It will be of immense benefit to all those employed in the laundry, be it the distributor or the supplier or the supplier.
Abhishek shared his happiness too.
There's a lot of things going on in front of me.
The other is Shailesh Bhosla from Mumbai.
8. 5 lakh (8.
During our Swachh Bharat programme, I had said that a new entrepreneurship is coming up with this scheme.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in taking this to work.
But many people don't know enough about this plan.
How should the programme be structured
How about the logo
But I'm expecting more suggestions.
There is a need for a lot of basic projects.
It will also provide an award to active participants.
Moreover, other gifts have also been announced.
My dear brothers, the month of winter has begun.
Everybody should join in the exercise by creating a good atmosphere in the family and making a festival.
You will be able to know through the festival of Exercise how much chaitanya can be remembered.
The body will be more active throughout the day.
Well, it's nice to have a good weather.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you.
Jai Hind.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I had the privilege of presenting Mann Ki Baat.
One year through Mann Ki Baat.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
From my experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can say that our ancestors have great power and truth in this thought because I have experienced it.
Several issues have started reaching the government from the bottom.
And, it is true that the basic principle of governance is that information should come down from the bottom to the top.
Did anyone ever think that this source of knowledge of Mann Ki Baat would ever be
But it happened.
So Mann Ki Baat gave us an opportunity to express the strength of the community.
The whole world was amazed when I said selfie with daughter one day.
It was a silent revolution.
People from every nook and corner of India sent millions of pictures.
Perhaps the tourism departments of the Government of India or the state government have not thought that we have so much wealth.
Mann Ki Baat became a platform and people took up work without spending a single rupee for the government.
I am happy to mention Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme in October last year.
Referring to Gandhi Jayanti, I urged the people to celebrate the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, encouraging Khadi products across the country.
There was a time when Khadi was called for the nation.
Couldn't it be Khadi for fashion now, according to the change of time
I wanted you to buy khadi to the people, to do something.
I am happy to note that Khadi sales have almost doubled.
It didn't happen because of government advertisements.
Lakhs and crores of rupees have been spent.
An experience of manpower, a victory.
Once I said in Mann Ki Baat, the poor man's house smokes tremors, the children cry.
Shouldn't they get a gas cylinder
Today, I can say with great pleasure that 30 lakh families in our country have abandoned LPG subsidy.
I have seen that a retired school teacher on the channel is standing in the queue to abstain from a widow's subsidy.
It's hard for middle class and lower class to leave subsidies.
But such people have abandoned the subsidy.
Isn't it a quiet revolution
We can't see the people's power in this.
Governments must learn that beyond this framework, there is a large populist-powerful, dynamic and determined society.
What else is there to enjoy
This time I thought of conducting a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
There will not be any place in India where people do not have phone calls.
This is a comfortable experience.
People of all ages have sent messages.
I wanted to hear some messages myself, and I liked it.
My team is taking action for the rest.
All the departments of the government will definitely consider your suggestions.
But one thing surprised me and enjoyed me.
Maybe we're neutral.
But my experience is different.
These fifty thousand people said their things in their own way.
How much people of the country are creatively thinking about it, how much wealth it is for the country
Perhaps only one or two phone calls are from the background of serious complaints.
It was a matter of great happiness that more than 90 per cent of our population is producing one kind of energy.
They must be listening to the radio.
He sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi is: Please urge the people of India to make maximum use of Diwali through this Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will not only benefit the environment but will also provide employment opportunities to thousands of silkworm brothers.
I believe that your feelings like Lord Acharya will reach and propagate in every corner of India.
I tell the countrymen that if we follow the path shown by Lord Acharya in the upcoming festivals, the flame of lamps will illuminate in their homes but the light will be spread in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
With our soldiers who are undertaking maritime trade and trade.
50 years of war with Pakistan in 1965.
The exhibition was organised in India Gate, Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to make history, it is necessary to know and understand the milestones of history.
History connects us to our roots.
If we lose ties with history, there is a complete reflection of the possibilities of history.
Don't hurry like me.
I was back in two and a half hours.
The kid's right.
And I can hear the criticisms of what happened.
I didn't feel that it was a bad thing that even the good Parliament I saw in it that there were discussions about cleanliness of India.
On the other hand, the Parliament on the one hand, on the other, a child on the other, both talk about cleanliness, and what is a greater good fortune for a country
This revolution of ideas is creating an atmosphere of hatred towards filth and awareness about cleanliness.
This will force governments to work.
We have to take up this task for the dream of Mahatma Gandhi while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi has said
If there is a need to choose one of these things for cleanliness and freedom, then I will choose cleanliness first and then I will be free.
Gandhiji gave more importance to cleanliness than freedom.
Gulshan Arrah Mygov from Delhi
In this regard, I would like to know about Deen Dayal ji's birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men always inspire us.
Our work is not going to assess which great men were followers of thoughts.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is an inspiration for us.
These days, there are opportunities to remember a lot of great men.
On 25th September Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, on 2nd October, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Jaiprakash Narayan on 11th October, and on 31st October, many such names are mentioned by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I would particularly like to take one more decision on 2nd October.
Whether it benefits or gives equal importance to handloom along with Khadi.
The weaver brothers have a lot of teachers.
They will be brought to the house of the poor widow who makes Khadi.
Therefore, this Deepawali must be replaced by Khadi and every one of you's homes and bodies.
Look, last time the sales have almost doubled.
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to have one thing.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose came to see me.
Everything was arranged by his grandson.
I have had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose.
My name is Bhargavi Kanaye.
I would like to inform you that the younger generation should be made aware of the registration of voters and that is why in the days to come, the participation of the younger generation will increase and the participation of the younger generation will increase in the future in government elections and governance.
Thank you, Bharagavi said that the list of voters is enrolled as well as voting items.
I would like to especially congratulate the Election Commission of India in this regard.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Electoral Commission acted only as a regulator, but it has changed in the last few years.
It's a very good change, but it doesn't matter if only the Election Commission works.
Generally, I want to say that the first day of elections is voting and water supply.
One, seven-year-old Kshitij Pandey is a student of 7th grade in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Banaras Hindu University.
I want the children of our country to enhance their scientific temper and interest.
He's 9 years old.
When she asked her father, she said it's been saying since she was 5.
I asked, where did you learn
Then I felt like sharing with you.
We're doing a lot of things that you don't know on TV or through newspapers.
I have to adjust my time with it.
Friends in the sky have to wait for me for half an hour.
This one month's broadcasting is the best.
The citizens of Hindustan were being exhorted through the radio about the freedom struggle.
The beginning of the Azad Hind Radio was through the news bulletin every week.
He broadcasts in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu languages.
I have also completed one year by presenting Mann Ki Baat in the sky.
We'll meet next month at Mann Ki Baat.
Let your instructions continue.
Your suggestions are beneficial for the government.
It starts with a good change.
Your partnership is precious, precious.
I once again extend my best wishes.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the people of India, through Akashwani, on 30th August, 2015, at 11.
My greetings to you, I have got a chance to present things in your mind to you.
South Indians celebrate the festival far and wide, on this occasion, I have celebrated the holy festival of Rakshabandhan throughout our country.
The Government of India has taken up new schemes for social security for the common man.
In a short span of time, all decent friends have adopted these schemes.
I had requested our sisters to implement security schemes on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
I see this as a good sign.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious festival of Rakshabandhan.
Today, a year ago, I had made available Jan Dhan Yojana to people in large numbers to talk to you.
The main source of income is in the banking sector and the bank friendly scheme has been formulated to bring the poorest of the poor to the bank.
Today, more than a lakh bank friends are operating all over the country.
This has provided employment to the youth.
You will be happy to hear that within a year, about one lakh thirty thousand economic awareness camps have been set up to link the banking sector with the economy and the poor.
I've put this kind of thing before you, and it's your job to continue this relationship.
All our accounts must be effective.
During the last few days, I had the opportunity to meet scholars from the Sufi tradition.
Their voices, their conversations, the generosity and softness of the Sufi traditions, are the rhythms of music.
I am glad that they have invited me to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru visited Bodh Gaya.
I will have the opportunity to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to repeat my thoughts.
These issues have been discussed a long time ago.
You must have heard me in Parliament, heard me in public meetings.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have nothing to fear.
I don't owe anyone such a chance.
We had an ordinance.
The Ordinance will expire tomorrow, 31st August.
I've decided to expire.
My farmer brothers and sisters, "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan", I would like to inform you that this is not just a mudra but also a mantra for us.
I want to tell you something else.
Two days ago, 50 years have passed since the 1965 war.
Whenever he remembered this war in 1965, he used to remember Lal Bahadur.
In addition to this, he will also remember the mudra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is quite natural to remember all the martyrs who have kept the Tricolour Flag of India and its glory and glory.
I salute all those associated with the war victory of the 65th.
Greetings to the heroes.
We have been inspired by these historical turmoils.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of Sufi tradition, I had the opportunity to interact with leading scientists of the country for hours and listen to their suggestions.
India is performing well in various fields of science and I am very happy.
In fact, our scientists do great things.
How do we get these types of research to the general public
How to use these principles practically
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I had said that we should lead our students to science.
I felt there were many opportunities and possibilities after this discussion.
I would like to say something special to my dear young friends.
In recent times, many guests from across the world have come to India.
Why don't we connect our festivals with cleanliness
This year, the beginning of the rain was good.
In our country, there is a shortage of food grains, oilseeds and pulses.
The poor need food grains and oil to cook vegetables.
However, this time the crops are producing immense pleasure and this year there has been an increase of about 50 per cent in food grains and 33 per cent in oilseeds.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters who have been responsible for this.
My dear countrymen, July 26 has been recorded as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The more the farmers of the country have a relationship with the land, the more they have relations with the army and the country.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers has attacked hundreds of enemies.
As a result of all their collective sacrifices, India is able to raise her head to the world today.
And that is why I salute our brave soldiers on Kargil Vijay Diwas.
Smt. Suchitra Ghawahari, Chennai has sent a number of suggestions.
I believe you'll all send good instructions.
I'd like to clarify my point of view in one thing.
I don't want to give any advice but I don't want to find ways to evacuate the state governments, the central governments or the local autonomous institutions from their duties.
Two days ago, I noticed the sight of a vehicle accident in Delhi, and after 10 minutes of the accident, the scooter was sliding off on the way.
He didn't get any help.
Likewise, a lot of people write to me on such topics, you talk about road safety issues and make the masses aware.
Be it Hoscott resident of Bangalore, Prasanka Kunjee of Mudubidri in Karnataka, I don't remember the names of all of them - they expressed their concern over it.
Every accident in our country is happening every minute.
A death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most tragic thing is that nearly one-third of the deaths are young people between the ages of 15 and 25, each of these deaths seizes a whole family.
Another thing that I suddenly remember is that a small band of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh have touched my heart.
'Brother No. 1' means an excellent brother can give his sister a toilet on Rakshabandhan day.
Inspire all such brothers and sisters to make toilets for their sisters so that the entire district and mothers and sisters do not have to undergo urination in the open space.
Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh is a small village inhabited by workers.
The people of that village have started and completed the campaign to construct toilets in the last few months.
Now in that village no one has to urinate in an open place.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me from Guwahati about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states.
Seven days camps have been organised in the states of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim and a team of Central Government officials has decided to visit the North-Eastern States.
The results of this effort will be in the coming days.
It is a matter of great concern that lack of emotional inclination towards science.
In a way, science and technology are the hallmarks of development.
Our IAS officers have grown up in a number of things and they have to interact sometimes with children in school or colleges around 2-4 hours a week and their experiences are their strengths.
We have started it and in the coming years our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
Children in the village should not have difficulty while studying in exams.
If we want to set up small and big industries in the villages, we need electricity.
Today, if they want to charge mobiles then they should go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should also be available to the villages.
That is why Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Yojana was launched.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to talk about every Indian.
And the months of August and September are our celebrations.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Sitting in the midst of the sufficient, he had heard a lot of things, saying things to the families of 130 crore people in a peaceful atmosphere.
Sometimes it becomes a motivation for those who want to do their own things.
I just used my words, my voice, but I don't think I don't. It's you.
I felt an emptyness.
Anyway, the last chance has come.
In a family environment, the Mann Ki Baat, small and small things.
In a way, let us continue this programme by giving birth to a new enthusiastic zeal to change society and life.
A lot of messages came in the past months, and people said, "Mann Ki Baat" doesn't hurt.
Sometimes I feel it's a journey from my 'self' to the 'self'.
This is the journey from I to Nami.
For me, my conversation with you was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people started asking a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
For me, I had the opportunity to interact with you.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes my thought process gets inspired and sometimes it gets inspired.
When people put forth challenges before the nation and society, they also suggest solutions.
In the letters, people explain the problems, and say peace and some suggestions, something expresses imagination, directly or indirectly.
That is, in a way, I can feel in your words how peace is available only to the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of soul-power, strength or prowess among the people.
We have to unite that strength and that achievement, give them an opportunity, and implement them.
Mann Ki Baat says that 130 crore people want to unite in a strong and active way in the progress of the country.
You can imagine how happy my mind is when I analyze these things and how much energy I get.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, let's continue the Mann Ki Baat.
So, not for the country, that election was not for the sake of self-interest, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps, in no country in the world, the people there would have voted for democracy only without taking into account the rights, powers and requirements of the people there for democracy.
That's how the country met in 1977.
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India and we feel that this number is normal.
However, considering the population of the world, more than one country except China has voted in India.
The number of people who voted in 2019 is more than the total population in the United States, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and excellence of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were the largest democratic elections in world history.
You can imagine the scale at which resources and manpower were required to conduct such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and other officers have been able to conduct this election day and night.
Approximately 3 lakh members of the Para Military Community participated in the successful conduct of this mass movement of democracy, 20 lakh police personnel from different states performed their duty and worked hard.
As a result of their hard work, more people were forced to vote this time than before.
More than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh Vivipat machines have been required to vote across the country.
You can imagine how long it's ready.
No voter can use his voter's right, that's why he did all this.
Polling stations have been set up only for a female voter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the electorate had to travel for two days to get there.
This is the honour of democracy in the right way.
The world's highest polling station is also in India.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahore-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
In this election, the percentage of votes of women and men was almost equal.
Another fact that adds to this spirit is that this time there are 78 women members in the Parliament who have a history.
I commend the Election Commission and everyone associated with the turnout programme and I salute the alert voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have often heard me say, "Bokey Book" is enough.
I said, "Use books instead of flowers" to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books somewhere.
In his stories, the entire Indian psychological emotions are incorporated.
While reading the story of 'destruction' he wrote, my mind turned to the economic imbalance in society.
I remembered the days when I was young.
How the discussion took place overnight on this subject came to mind.
The son of Jammu, Ishwari and Bir of a poor family can learn from this story that if you don't keep yourself in mind then you won't understand when you will be caught in the impact of evil violence.
A sensory boy's infinite love for his grandmother, a sensible feeling of cooking at his young age.
We can see that human sensitivity has reached parallel when we reach Grandma by buying a harvest from the 4-5 year old Hamid Festival.
After losing harvest, farmer Haldu will be glad that he will no longer have to sleep in the fields in the cold.
These stories are almost a century ago but we still feel their beauty.
K.
Muraleedharan and P.
Today, this library is a guide for all, including tribal children.
A successful experiment was the mass movement in Gujarat under the name of 'Vanche Gujarat'.
Millions of people from all ages participated in this initiative to read books.
In today's digital world, during the period of Guru Gobind ji, I should find some time to appeal to you and give you books for some time in your day-to-day business.
Give you a good experience and definitely write about the book that is reading in the Narendra Modi App and let all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about a challenge not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov... and seeing a lot of people writing about the problem of water.
Apart from Pawan Gaurai of Balgavi and Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, others like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf have written to me about the challenges related to water.
Water has great significance in our culture.
You bless your motherland, and be gracious to us.
Water scarcity affects many parts of the country and every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water received during the year is harvested.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
We will find peace with the peoples participation, with the capability, co-operation and determination of one crore and thirty million people, as well as with other issues.
New Jal Shakti Mantralaya has been created in the country with utmost emphasis on water.
This will enable decision making for all water related issues.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote letters to villagers all over the country.
I wrote to the people of the village to conserve water, to conserve water, and not to lose rain, to conclude with the villagers.
I am glad that they did it and on the 22nd of this month crores of people performed Shramdaan in thousands of panchayats.
The people of the villages resolved to store every drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to the message given by the villagers of Lupung Panchayat in Katakmasandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand: My name is Thiruvananthapuram Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote to us for water conservation, we did not believe that the Prime Minister had written such a letter to us.
Once again, the people there are ready to play their active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the rural heads and all the villagers on the occasion of their zeal.
The people of the village now feel that they are competing to build a temple for water in their village.
As I said, social efforts can bring about qualitative changes.
There cannot be any 'strategy' across the country to deal with the problem of water.
Several initiatives are being taken in different ways for this purpose.
But everyone's aim is to save water, water conservation.
Drainage lines are being repaired in Punjab.
This effort will help in reducing the problem of water consumption.
The construction of tanks in Timmaipalle, Telangana has transformed the lives of rural people.
Small ponds built in the agricultural land of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have made a big difference.
I read about a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women organised to revive the river Nag.
He also read about the women of Gwal who have worked hard for rain water harvesting in collaboration with each other.
There are several such efforts and I am confident that if we make a strong effort together, we can make it impossible.
When people come together, the water will be preserved.
I say, the water is touching, and with the touch of the water, a new life will be created.
A Water Conservation Movement can be organised to protect every drop of water.
We can talk about water related issues and also spread water conservation practices.
I particularly urge the distinguished personalities of various fields to make a separate campaign for water conservation.
People associated with films, sports, media, friends, social organizations, people associated with cultural organisations, all those who sing stories and narrate narratives should take the lead in their own way.
We can awaken society, unite society and join society.
Look, we can see a change in front of our eyes.
I urge you all to share your knowledge on the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you have the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of a venerable father, then you must see another house behind your father's house where there is a 200-year-old water storage, which still has water.
There's a provision to stop rainwater.
I always say that those who go to the Kirti Mandir must see the water storage.
Several similar types of water storage systems are located in many places.
All of you, use the HanShakti4alShakti hashtag to share your knowledge.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you for one more thing and thank the people of the world.
If all those who love Yoga at every corner of the world with the rising sun welcome the sun, then it is a journey till the sun sets.
Prime Ministers, eminent people and ordinary citizens from all over the world have shown how they celebrated Yoga in their country.
The world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that a healthy and sensitive person is required to build a healthy society and that is what Yoga ensures.
Therefore, the promotion of Yoga is an important matter related to social service.
And that kind of service should be accepted and respected.
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Ministers Award for outstanding stakeholders in promoting and promoting Yoga in 2019.
You cannot imagine that the awards have been given to great organizations all over the world and how they have played an important role in promoting Yoga.
Japan Yoga Niketan, where many institutes and training courses are conducted.
Miss Italy.
We have a very inspiring example.
Whether it is a matter related to Yoga or not, can Indians stand behind
Behar Yoga Vidyalaya at Munger was also honoured and they have been dedicated to Yoga for the last one decade.
Likewise, he also honoured Swami Rajarshi Muni and established the Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll wait for your instructions.
It is a great journey for me to associate your thoughts with Mann Ki Baat.
Come on, let's sit together, let's share your thoughts.
I'll listen to what you have in your mind, keep it intact, understand it.
Sometimes I'll try to live with your feelings.
Your blessings must be there.
You're my inspiration, you're my energy.
Come, let us together share the happiness of Mann Ki Baat and take up the responsibility of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Hello, my dear countrymen.
These brave heroes sacrificed themselves for the sake of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Our brave sons kept watch overnight for the people to sleep peacefully.
At the same time, the invaders were answered in their own language.
You must have seen how the attack took place within 100 hours.
The army is determined to root out terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, we have seen an exciting response from their families through the medium of martial arts which enhances the enthusiasm of the entire nation.
The feeling expressed by Ram Ranjan Ji, the father of the brave Jawan of Bhagalpur in Bihar, is a source of inspiration for all of us.
The nation salutes the bravery of the martyr Prasanna Sahu's wife Minaji in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
I swear to join the CRPF the only son of myself.
The same feeling is seen in every household of our brave and brave martyrs.
I want to tell the youth that the feelings expressed by these families should be understood and tried to understand their minds.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, the War Memorial that we have been waiting for in this long period of our independence is being witnessed.
It is natural for people to have curiosity and curiosity in this regard.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has expressed happiness that Shri Onkar Shetty, from the textiles in Karnataka will complete the National War Memorial at the App.
I was surprised and anguished that the National War Memorial in India was not so long.
We needed a War Memorial to replicate the bravery of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the sake of the nation.
I decided to have such a memorial.
I am happy that the decision to build a National War Memorial will be completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, i.e. on February 25, millions of our countrymen will dedicate this National Military Memorial to our armies.
The country will make a small attempt to repay the debt.
This new memorial has been built in the heart of Delhi, i. e.
I am confident that going to this National Military Memorial will be equivalent to going to a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of gratitude to the nation for the great martyrs since independence.
The design of the memorial shows the valour of our brave soldiers.
The National Army Memorial is designed in three circles, covering the journey from birth to martyrdom of every soldier.
The burning flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
The second cycle reflects the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This circle shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the greatest martyrs of the country are recorded in the golden letters.
And then there is a protective cycle, which shows security.
There's a row of dense trees in this circle.
I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation in October last year.
It was also a reflection of the perspective that the country should be grateful to the police men and women who are constantly working for our security.
I am sure you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share the pictures from there in the social media that may it inspire others, may it inspire others to see these monuments in a sacred place.
My dear countrymen, I am getting thousands of letters and comments from you people for Mann Ki Baat through many media.
Incidentally, March 3 is the birthday of Jamshedji Tata.
Both personalities are from a very different family background that has enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baat is like a reflection of the proud history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have enhanced the glory of not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
People are grateful for their contribution towards the entire nation.
Do you know why the British humiliated the path of cowardice
Because even the British who built such a big empire were afraid of him.
Birsa used his traditional arrow and villa to shake the British rule that used guns and cannons.
Birsa is not only fighting the British for political freedom but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his short life.
He illuminated the sun in the darkness of the deprived and the exploited.
At the age of 25, he sacrificed his life.
The brave sons of Mother India like Birsa Munda have been born in all parts of the country.
There will not be any corner of India that has not played its part in this centuries-long freedom struggle.
If the personality like Birsa Munda makes us aware of our survival, the personality like Jamshedji Tata gave us a big institution in the country.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies and this should be an industrial hub.
Today, the Tata Institute of Science, called the Indian Institute of Science, was established as a result of his long vision.
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jemshadji Tata and Swami Vivekananda are on board a ship during their journey to America.
It is said that this discussion has led to the establishment of the India Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country, Mr.
As you all know, this day comes only once in four years.
Morarjibhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country, the owner of a simplest and peaceful personality.
Morarjibha had the privilege of presenting the budget as the largest in the Independent Parliament of India.
In the name of this, he had to pay for the old age.
The government arrested him and sent him to jail.
However, when the Janta Party won the elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
Through this 44th Amendment, the Act has been enacted to publish proceedings in the Parliament and in the Houses of Parliament.
Some of the powers of the Supreme Court were reinstated and the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution were not repealed even during the Emergency.
Asked by the Cabinet, the President was required to declare a state of emergency and not extend the period of emergency once more than six months.
Morarjibhai ensured that the 1975 emergency declaration and the killing of democracy would not repeat it in the future.
The coming generation will always remember his great contribution in maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my tributes to that great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, this time there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people about the Padma awards.
They are the ones who bring about positive change in the lives of others in different ways by the strength of their spirit.
It was a great thing to bring a rare painting closer to the new generation.
I gave a presentation to the former President of America, Barrack Obama, on the artwork of Tree of Life, built by Abdul Ghafoor.
The Padma Awardees are known as Shabbir Said Gomata of Marathwada.
Listening to the Tao Porchon-ynch of America, you will be surprised to know that Ling is now a big institution for Yoga.
My dear countrymen, this year, 12 of the awardees of the Padma Awards are farmers.
Normally, very few people associated with agriculture have come to the list of Padma Shris.
This is a life-style picture of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I am going to tell you something auspicious that has been in my mind for the past few days.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have been benefitted from this scheme.
I have seen how it brings about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If you know someone who's filthy to treat them because there's no money, tell them about this plan.
This scheme is meant for such poor people, my dear countrymen, is going to start exam time in schools.
In the next few weeks, examinations of various educational boards, twelfth grade and curriculum will be started across the country.
I extend my heartiest greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to write the examinations.
A few days ago, a big programme was organized at the Town Hall in Delhi to discuss the issue.
In this town hall, I have been able to interact with millions of students, parents and teachers from all over the country and abroad with the help of technology.
In a way, through the radio, I talk to millions of families every month.
Often, when I talk to you and read your letters, I think you are a part of my family when you hear the suggestions you send on the phone.
It makes me feel very comfortable.
Friends, elections are the biggest festival of democracy.
Mann Ki Baat has been telling you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat January 2019
On the 21st of this month, the country received a very sad news.
Shri Sri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji became a disabled person from Siddhganga Monastery in Tumkur district of Karnataka.
Sivakumaraswamy had dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us - Kayakave Kailas - that is, it is equivalent to being in the habitat of Lord Shiva by performing his duties in a rigorous manner.
Sivakumar Swamiji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people in his 111-year career.
He was a scholar in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He strived hard to provide food, housing, education, and spiritual knowledge to the people.
His priorities were all kinds of good for the farmers.
Siddhganga Monastery usually used to organize livestock fairs.
I am fortunate to have got the blessings of the venerable Swami ji several times.
Kalam Saheb had recited a poem on the occasion of venerated Swami ji.
Once again, I offer my homage to that great soul.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January 1950, the Constitution was framed in our country.
In those days, our country is for the Republic.
Yesterday we celebrated Republic Day.
But I'd like to tell you something else.
25th January was the Electoral Day of the Election Commission and this day is celebrated as National Voters Day.
People all over the world are surprised to see the massive electoral process in India.
It is natural for all citizens of our country to be proud of the Election Commission when it is done well by our Election Commission.
You must have heard that there is only one polling booth in the Gir forest in Gujarat.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I compliment the Election Commission for its relentless efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission of India, the Security Officers and other officers of all the States for ensuring free and fair elections that are participants in the voting process.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country.
This will be the first time that youngsters born in the 21st century will exercise their right to vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have a chance to take responsibility for the country.
They are going to determine the patriotism of the country.
It's time to integrate your dreams with the dreams of the nation.
I urge the younger generation to register as a voter when it is older to vote.
And we have to think that voting is our duties.
If there is no reason to vote in life for any reason, it must be very painful.
I feel sad to see something wrong happens in the country.
Our country is a multi-storeyed Vasundhara.
One of those great personalities was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes who had laid down their lives for India's freedom.
Since the time of independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings have been closed.
These locked rooms in the Red Fort have now become a beautiful museum, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Every stone of this museum is filled with the scent of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum, the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle reflect and inspire us to go to history.
At the same venue, the British Government had filed a case against the brave sons of Bharatmata - Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gurbaksh Dhilan and Major General Shanwas Khan.
I gave it to the museum to keep the hat and the next visitors also wanted to see the hat and inspire the patriotism from it.
However, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders must continue to bring new generations in different ways.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose raised the Tricolour on the top of the Tricolour Flag 75 years ago.
Similarly, in the Red Fort in October 2018, the Tricolour Flag will always be surprised because it will continue to hoist the flag on August 15th.
Now it was the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Dilli Chalo, Tum Me Khoon Do, Mim Tum Azadi Dunga (Go to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom), Netaji made a place in the hearts of all Indians.
In the last few years, there has been a need to make files related to Netaji available to the general public.
I'm glad I could do it.
I remember the day when Netaji's family members came together at the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am glad that an effort has been made to develop several places related to the great leaders of India in Delhi.
Be it 26 Alipur Road related to Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir, it is a matter of great happiness.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
He had also chosen a radio to interact with people and in 1942, Subhash Babu started the Azad Hind Radio.
I understand that this radio station has been broadcasting the bulletin every week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station is being run by Gujarati M.
R.
Vyas had played an important role.
Normally people liked programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio.
Those programmes were immensely inspiring for the freedom fighters.
The Visual Kala Museum is also built in this Kranti Mandir.
I have tried to describe Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, which have more than 450 paintings and other artworks of three centuries old.
The Museum has exhibited excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avenendranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Rai, Sailos Mukherji etc.
I specially urge you all to go there and keep in mind the writings of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You must be wondering why I want to hear the great writings of Gurudev Tagore while talking about art.
Perhaps you might have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
He painted pictures of animals and birds, painted a lot of natural sights, beyond that he explored human nature and art in Kanwas.
It is important to mention that Gurudev did not give names to many of his writings.
He was supposed to know that those who saw the paintings he painted should understand the painting themselves and that his message in it should be understood from his own point of view.
His pictures are displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
Our great personalities have given a message of equality, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Sant Ravidas was such a great soul.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Sant Ravidas.
The Dohas of Sant Ravidas ji are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the sacred land of Varanasi.
Through his messages, he tried to convey the importance of hard work and devotion throughout his life.
In our space programme, many young scientists from across the country have contributed to the space programme.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are coming out of space.
On January 24, the art of our students has been launched.
Sounding rockets made by students in Odisha are also being set up in a new record.
Over the last four years, space missions have been launched across the country since independence to space missions since 2014.
We have established the world record of launching 104 satellites in a single ecosystem.
We are going to ensure India's presence on the moon through Chandrayaan 2 soon.
Our country uses space technology to protect the lives and property of the people.
Outer space technology is immensely helpful in weather forecasts, railways and road safety.
Naval equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers and sisters, which is helpful in economic recovery along with their safety.
We use space technology to deliver government services to the people and to ensure their responsibilities effectively.
Under the Housing for All (Housing for All) scheme, about 40 lakh houses in 23 States have been junked.
In addition to this, about three and a half crore land belonging to MNREGA has been jettised.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country.
Through our competitive satellite launch service, India is today launching not only satellites of developing countries but also of developing countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive to the children.
Our space programmes allow children to think a lot and go beyond the limits that they consider impossible today.
It's a vision for our children to watch the stars and inspire them to find new stars.
At the Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune in January, 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games.
This time, in Khelo India, sportspersons from all the states performed well in their own way.
Life is a strong inspiration for many medal winners.
Young wrestler Akash Gorkha won the silver medal and I read that Akash's father Akashji worked as a guardian at a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Sonali Helvi is a resident of Satara, the captain of 21 women's Kabbadi team in Maharashtra.
She lost her father at a very young age, and her brother and mother encouraged Sonali's talent.
Normally, girls will not be encouraged to participate in sports like Kabadi.
But Sonali chose balls and showed the best performance.
10-year-old Abhinav Shah of Asansol is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshata Baswanikamati, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won a gold medal in weightlifting.
When we talk about India's creation, we should remember that youth is the vision of New India.
While narrating these stories of Khelo India, it should be remembered that New India is not only the contribution of the people of big cities but also the contribution of youngsters, children and young sports-persons from small towns and villages and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about the beauty of your name.
But have you heard of a competition to make toilets beautiful
More than 50,000 toilets have participated in this strange competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
I urge all the Sarpanches and the rural heads to lead this movement in their Panchayats.
You must share your photos of Swachh Sundar Shauchalay with Mylathar on social media.
Friends, on 2nd October, 2014, we started a memorable journey with the aim of making the country clean and avoiding open defecation.
My little friends, the days of exams are coming closer.
Amsul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exam warriors.
Thank you for taking this matter into consideration.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the examination season.
I would like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat today, but I would like to interact with students from all over the country at 11. 00 AM on 29th January, 2019, along with students, parents and teachers.
This time, students from other countries are also participating in the event.
In this Exam Pe Charcha, I will talk to my young friends on all aspects related to the examination, especially the stress free exam.
I will certainly put some of these suggestions and suggestions in front of you at the Town Hall.
You must join this program.
Through social media or NAMO AP LUDE, you can see it telecast live.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is the memorial of venerated father.
At 11pm, the entire nation will pay homage to the martyrs.
Wherever we are, we must pay our homage to our two-minute martyrs.
Remember venerable Bapu, let us move forward with a determination to fulfill his dreams, to build a New India, to perform his duties as citizens.
This journey of 2019 can be successfully carried forward.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
My dear countrymen, hello.
The year 2018 is about to end.
We are entering by 2019.
We can naturally hear the discussions about the year ahead, with the discussions over the past year.
Whether it is the life of a person or of a society, whether it is the life of a nation, everyone has to look back and look forward to it as much as possible.
This is the result of the achievements of experiences and the confidence to do something new.
Besides bringing about changes in our lives, we should think about what can contribute to taking the country and the society forward.
I wish you all the very best in 2019.
As a result of the resolve of the people of the country, the values of cleanliness have gone up by 95 per cent.
After independence, for the first time from the Red Fort, the Tricolour was raised on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The Champions of the Earth Award, the highest environmental recognition of the United Nations, was given to the nation.
Indias efforts towards solar energy and climate change have been recognized globally.
International Solar Alliance (ISA) was the first convention of the International Solar Alliance in India.
Our country has had unprecedented excellence in the Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Our girls have enhanced the country's pride by nurturing the world with the help of naval civilizations.
The country's first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
Bogibeel Bridge, the longest rail-road bridge in the country, has been dedicated to the nation and Sikkims first and 100th airport in the country has been inaugurated at Pakyong.
India won the Under-19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India has won many medals in the Asian Games.
India has also performed well in the Para Asian Games.
The Mann Ki Baat will go on for the year 2019, if we start listing the list of all Indian social initiatives.
This has been possible due to the untiring efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey of Indias progress and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, we have lost some of our family members who were specialists in December.
Dr. Jayachandran was known as one of the cheapest treatment providers for the poor.
Similarly, on December 25, Sulagiti Narasama of Karnataka was killed.
Sulagiti Narasamma was helpful in the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
They have provided services to thousands of mothers and sisters especially in the remote areas of Karnataka.
There are many inspiring people like Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narasamma.
They have laid down their lives for the good of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, we want to talk about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Some party activists told me that some of the city's young doctors were treating the poor in the camp.
The Heart Lungs Critical Centre is conducting medical camps every month where there is a provision for free diagnosis and treatment of many diseases.
Today, hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors, who are selflessly serving, must be appreciated.
Today, I can say with great pride that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been successful only through social efforts.
A few days ago, I was told that more than 3 lakh people had joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
In this campaign for Swachhta, City Corporation, Services Organizations, School-College students and all the people of Jabalpur participated enthusiastically.
I'm Thebetterindia.
Whenever I get a chance, I definitely go to the beatterindia.com and try to find out about such motivational sources.
I am glad that many such websites introduce us to many stories that inspire people and lives of distinguished people.
com is an attempt to promote positivity and make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, yourstory. com tells us a lot about young innovators and the success stories of industrial enterprises.
Combine positivity.
I am confident that more and more people will know about our heroes who are bringing about changes in society.
It's easy to spread negativeness.
But, in our society, we have a lot of good things, which can be achieved only through the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
Hanay is a 12-year-old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanna taught me to concentrate and reflect, learnt about its various stages and proved herself.
I wish them a bright future for all the countrymen.
My best wishes and blessings to Hanaiah.
Likewise, a 16-year-old boy, Rajini, was also discussed in the media.
You must have read it.
Rajni Jr. Women won the gold medal at the wrestling championship.
When Rajani won the medal, the child went to the nearest milk store and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni Medal was wrapped in a cloth and placed in a bag.
You must be wondering why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The kid was honouring Jasmersing for doing that, and he's selling luxury at a snack stall.
Rajni said his father suffered a lot of hardships and suffered a lot in bringing the maid to this floor.
Jasmer Singh goes to work every morning before Rajini and his brothers wake up.
When he informed his father about his interest in learning Rajni Boxing, he organized all possible things and encouraged his daughter's enthusiasm.
Rajini's wrestling training took the old gloves, because at that time the family's financial condition was very bad.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajani didn't get excited, had to learn wrestling.
He has won a medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune has become the fastest man in the world.
The boy travelled 300 kilometers a day to 159 days on a bike.
The enthusiasm of the child to ride on a bike is surely appreciable.
We don't get inspired by such achievements.
Many congratulations to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of emotions like Ekta, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, in diversity, is filled with our festivals.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different, and here the individual and prosperity are the same.
A good example of our close relations with nature is the calendar and the Panchangam based on festivals.
It will also communicate with the yearlong festivities on the surface of planets and stars.
It's decided by what calendar it's forbidden.
Celebrations and festivals are celebrated on the basis of planetary constellations in many areas.
Gudi Padwa, Chedichand and Ugadi are all celebrated according to the lunar calendar while Tamilnadu, Puttanth, Vishu, Vaishakham, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakhi and Bihu are celebrating all these festivals on the basis of the sunrise.
The feeling of cloaking rivers and water is particularly inherent in many of our festivals.
The Chhath festival is associated with sunrise in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people drown in the holy rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have an ancient significance and on the other, all festivals, on the other, inspire the lessons of life to live in harmony with each other in a perfectly natural manner.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for 2019 and wish you all the very best for the upcoming festivals.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the world come and attend the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh is a part of a people's ocean of faith and devotion.
Together, millions of people from within and outside the country gather together.
The traditions of the Kumbh have thrived in our great cultural heritage.
Perhaps you will be very enthusiastic about the world famous Kumbh Mela celebrated in Prayagraj since January 15 this year.
The Saint-Mahatmal has already reached for the Kumbh Mela.
It is a great proof that the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity has added to Manizla that it is globally important.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries saw preparations for Kumbh Mela.
There, the national flags of many countries have been raised.
People from over 150 countries are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj.
This is a major study study, especially for the youth.
I went to Prayag Raj a few days ago and saw preparations for the Kumbh festival taking place enthusiastically.
This time, there is a lot of importance in sanitation.
There will be cleanliness with devotion and the message will reach far and wide.
This time, devotees can also visit Akshayvad after the holy dip in the Sangam.
This symbol of the faith of the people has been shut down in the fort for hundreds of years, so the devotees could not see even if they wanted.
This time, everyone has been allowed access.
All of you must attend the Kumbh Mela, share the pictures of different levels in the midst of the society, so that more and more people get inspired to go to Kumbh.
May the spiritual Kumbh be the greatest festival of Indian philosophy.
May the Kumbh of faith be the glory of nationalism.
May the Kumbh of artistic literature be the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the minds of people on the occasion of Republic Day celebrations on 26th January and on that day we remember the great personalities of our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the centenary year of revered Bapu.
The President of South Africa, Mr.
Cyril Ramaphosa is visiting India as the Chief Guest on Republic Day this year.
There was an infinite bond between venerable Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan, the Mahatma was from this visionary Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa with strong opposition to colourful discrimination.
He set up Phoenix, Tolstoy Farms, from where the voice of peace and justice flows all over the world.
He had the patience and motivation to stay in jail for so many years.
Mandela wrote about Bapu, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because it is here that he started an innovative experiment.
This is where he showed his firm stature for justice, where he raised the philosophy of Satyagraha and the ways of fighting.
He saw Bapu as a role model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration all over the world, but their ideals inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a conference of DGPs was held at Kavadia on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat, where there is a statue of Statue of Unity all over the world.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the nation.
He has always lived up to the integrity of India.
Sardar Saheb believed that the strength of India depends on the diversity here.
Respecting Sardar Saheb's emotions, I pay tributes to him through this award of Unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For a long time in his life, his workplace was North India and he was shot at Namdet in Maharashtra.
The land of birth in Patna, the land of action in North India, the last moment of life in Namded.
In a way, he received his blessings throughout the year.
Guru Gobind Singh ji attained the Guru's position at the age of 9 after the martyrdom of Guru Tej Bahadur ji.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji had the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a calm and simplistic personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice for the poor and the weak, that is why he said - (Sawa Lakh se Ek Lada Umchidiom Som Baj Tudam Tunda Umtabe Gobind Singh Nam Kahla.
He was a divine man full of heroism, valour, sacrifice and religious sentiments.
He had supernatural weapons and science.
In addition to being a warrior, he also knew many languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again bow down to Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, many good things happen in the country but there is no detailed discussion about them.
As part of the RITER India Movement, health tours are being organised across the country.
The event will be held by 27th January.
It is commendable that I am trying to spread awareness and awakening among the people beyond this.
When India is clean, it will be prosperous.
Nutrition is the most important diet for good health.
To start with this thing.
It is important to learn lessons about the importance of food from childhood.
Come, let us move ahead to scale new heights for new inspiration, zeal and determination, let us move ahead, let us change ourselves, let us change our country.
In MyGov, Amshukumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar, and Vikas Yadav from Patna, similarly, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi in the app, Monica Jane from Delhi, the Presidency Government from Burdwan in West Bengal, and music scientists from Nagpur, asked about the same question.
They say that people are usually connected to you through modern technology, social media and mobile apps.
I'd like to tell you a story.
It was in 1998.
I was an organiser of Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
May was the month.
It was a little Daba.
I don't understand.
Seeing my response, he said, look, sir, listen to the radio.
Recently, Akashwani conducted a survey on Manki Baat.
Some of these Facebook responses are very interesting.
Average 70 of the surveyed persons usually hear Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has evolved positive thinking in the society.
Mann Ki Baat has encouraged many people.
A comprehensive discussion on India Positive was also held.
I am happy to see that radio becomes more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets Mike, millions and millions of people have to listen, what do you want
Their findings are that there is no politics in this program.
At the beginning of Mann Ki Baat, it was decided that there should not be any politics in it, it should not be the songs of the government, it should not be the songs of Modi.
I was inspired by you the most inspired by my decision.
There will always be small stories of 130 crore people.
With new inspiration and enthusiasm, this country will scale new heights.
When I read a letter, a feeling like that makes me feel like it.
With two words, I share it with you in my experience.
When will a government be able to propagate the Selfie With Doter programme in a small village in Haryana not only in the country but also abroad
In all sections of the society, the well-known celebritys are associated with it and the thinking of the society has awakened in the new language that today's generation understands.
Man Keebat is not about the government, it's about the society.
Manki Baat is a matter of aspirational India.
The life of India is not politics, nor is it power of monarchy.
India's life is social justice and social power.
There are thousands of heads in social life, one of them is political.
If everything becomes political, it's not good for society.
Sometimes political events and those working in politics, and other talents of the society, suppress their livelihoods.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is an easy job for me.
People's letters come before all the Mann Ki Baats.
My attempt is to see the maximum number of letters and comments before the Mann Ki Baat.
I hear a lot of phone calls.
As Man Keebath's episode approaches, I read your ideas and inputs very carefully during the journey.
So whenever you read a letter, the environment of the writer, his feelings, become part of my thoughts.
That letter is not just a piece of paper for me.
In the last 40-45 years, I have led the life of a dynasty, I have gone to almost every district of the country, I have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
The proposals of unincorporated letters in Mann Ki Baat are also being taken into consideration in the respective departments.
I would like to thank my friends from Akashwani, FM radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels, social media etc.
Because of their hard work, more and more people are able to reach Mann Ki Baat.
Akashwani team prepares all episodes to be broadcasted in many languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat in the same fashion, in the local language, in sync with Modi.
Thus they become Modi for 30 minutes.
I convey my best wishes and thanks to them for their talent and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this program in local languages.
Mann Ki Baat on their channels would like to thank friends of the media who are listening every month.
A person in politics is not happy with the media but he feels that he gets very little coverage and if he gets the coverage then he says that it is a negative coverage.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'll do it in every family.
It's easier to understand if we don't get through the old sheep of our own life.
One cannot understand that one has abandoned his thoughts and accepted the thoughts of the offender.
The specialty of today's youth is that they do not do things that are self-confidenced and if they believe in something then they leave everything behind and follow it.
Sometimes people talk about the ideal departure of families with youngsters.
In fact, the limit for talking to more families and youngsters is very low.
It is said that you don't do that for a long time, or about habits and lifestyles.
I have been trying to talk to the youth through social media through various programmes.
I try to learn from them what they do, what they think.
They always have a storehouse of ideas.
They are very vibrant, innovators and concentrates.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to connect the youth with their hardships and their concerns even more.
Sometimes the youngsters are complaining about more questions.
I'm saying that the youngsters are asking questions.
We feel that today's youngsters are very ambitious and think big things.
It is good to have big dreams and great achievements. Finally, this is New India, New India.
Some say the youth want to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking you what's wrong with it.
Many things do at the same time, because they're capable of multi-tasking.
Whether it is social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other sector, it is the youth who bring about big changes in the society.
Young people who dared ask questions and dream new dreams.
If the thoughts of the youth are brought to the ground, they will be able to bring about progressive changes in the country by giving them an open environment to express them.
My dear countrymen, Vineetaji of Gurugram has written on MyGov that in this Mann Ki Baat, I would like to mention the Constitution Day.
It is a humble statement that that day is great because we enter the seventies of our Constitution.
Thank you very much for this comment.
The Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days to fulfil this historic task.
Imagine that in three years, these great personalities have given us such a wider and wider constitution.
Today's time is an example of management and productivity that they have built the Constitution at such an unusual pace.
It will also inspire us to fulfill our responsibilities on record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of the great talents of the country, all of whom were committed to empowering India and giving it to the Constitution that empowers the poorest of the poor.
When India completed 60 years of its republic in 2010, a grand tour was organised in Gujarat with an elephant beyond the Constitution.
It was an opportunity to remind the youth of awakening about the Constitution and connecting them with the various heads of the Constitution.
By 2020, we will complete 70 years of our Republic and 75 years of our Independence in 2022.
Let us move ahead with our Constitutional values and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that Indians are different, but we must be the nation above all.
India First India is the first Dr.
It is proposed to celebrate this opportunity in all the State Governments and Union Territories.
Similarly, it will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
Along with this, a train will run on the way to holy places related to Guru Nanak Devji.
During the last few days, I was reminded of the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara suffered major losses.
Our journey will continue.
As much as you are connected, our journey will be deeper and everyone will be happy.
Sometimes somebody's got a question in his mind - What did I get through the Mann Ki Baat
Your noble wishes are my great wishes.
Come on, let's go further through this journey.
31st October is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Like every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for the unity of the country for the race for unity.
The weather is very comfortable now.
I urge you all to participate in the Radio Forum Unit with enthusiasm.
About six and a half months before independence, the world's most famous international publication The Time Magazine was a photograph of Sardar Patel on the cover page of lunch published on January 27, 1947.
They gave a picture of India along with the main article, which was not the same as we have seen today.
It was a picture of India scattered in many parts.
There were more than 550 countries in those days.
The British were indifferent to India.
He says how he did rescue operations during the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s.
Bardoli tells us how he gave direction to the Satyagraha.
From farmers, workers to industrialists, everyone was able to trust him and his loyalty and commitment to the country.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be very special and the Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel.
Established on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, the height of this statue is twice as high as the Statue of Liberty in America.
This is the tallest Gaganas statue in the world.
It is a matter of pride for all Indians that the world's tallest statue is on the Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with soil, will also be a decoration of the sky.
Dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated Infantry Day.
I salute all those who are part of the Indian Army.
I salute the families of the soldiers in the name of their courage.
But do you know why we, the people of Hindustan, are celebrating Infantry Day
This was the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed in Kashmir and dumped Kashmir from the hijackers.
This historic event is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an interview with Sam Manek Shah, the greatest military officer in India.
In that interview, Field Marshal Manek Shah is talking about the period when he was a field marshal.
At that time, in October 1947, a military force was launched in Kashmir.
31st October marks the commemoration of our former Prime Minister, Smt.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Dr.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like games and sports
Spirits, strings, skills and stamina are all important in the world of sports.
This is the result of the success of any sportsman.
Recently, two meetings were held in memory.
First is an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
Similarly, in Argentina, there was a chance to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018.
In the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth showed the best performance ever.
In this, we have won 13 medals and three medals in Mix.
This is the story of Indian Sports which touches new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where no one has thought.
He lost his father when he was eight years old.
He lived in orphanage for the next eight years.
After leaving the orphanage, he cleaned DDC buses to move forward and worked as a waiter on the coastal areas of Delhi.
Today, Narayan International has won gold medals for India.
Not only this, look at the heights of excellence in sports.
India has never won a Senior Lovely or Junior Lovely Olympics in Judo.
But Tababi Devi won a silver medal in Judo at the Youth Olympics and composed history.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old sportsperson, lives in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a worker, and the mother runs fishing.
Often this kid's family had no money to buy food.
Even in such a scenario, the zeal of Goddess Tababi didn't touch the castle.
Then he won a medal for the country and composed history.
There are countless stories like this.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is the essence of New India.
My dear countrymen, in 2017, we successfully organised the FIFA U-17 World Cup.
As a successful tournament, the entire world appreciated it.
This year, India is fortunate to host the Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
In the minds of all Indians, whatever game is playing, there will definitely be a chain for the hockey in any game.
India has gifted great hockey players.
Whenever we talk about Hockey in the world, the story of Hockey is incomplete besides these great sportspersons of India.
Hockey magician Major Dhyanchand is known all over the world.
Subsequently, Hockey has undertaken a long journey from Balwinder Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj.
Even today, the team of Indian sportspersons continue to inspire the new generation of Hockey through their success due to their hard work and dedication.
Sports is a good opportunity for lovers to see thrilling games.
Do not go to Bhubaneswar and boost the spirit of Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
But in a new era, in a new way, in a new generation, with a new zeal, with a new zeal and enthusiasm, we are coming forward to do these things with new dreams.
Some teach children, some teach adults, some are involved in cleanliness, some are helping the farmers.
There is no desire to do all this, but it has dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young man learnt to play wheelchair basketball to help the Divyangjans wheelchair basketball team.
This enthusiasm, this dedication is a work in the mission mode.
Whether an Indian would not be proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I looked at the suggestions related to Mann Ki Baat, I found a very attractive note of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
He has written on MyGov, Please tell me in Mann Ki Baat, how the tribals of India and their way of life and tradition become the best example of co-existence with nature.
We must learn from them what is the need to make traditions a part of our lives for sustainable development.
Mr. Manish ji, I congratulate you for putting this issue before the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter of motivation for us to look at our glorious past and culture, especially in the world, and especially in the western countries, to look for new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribal community of Madhya Pradesh, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship the trees named Alvaram and Arjun with respect.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to preserve the environment.
Especially for protecting the trees, they don't want to sacrifice their lives, but they don't want to harm even a tree.
Envoys of Arunachal are supposed to have a direct relationship with tigers.
They look like their own brothers and sisters.
People from the Warli community of Maharashtra see tigers as guests and for them the presence of tigers is abundant.
The Gaudh tribes in Central India stop fishing in some parts of the Kaithan river during the fish breeding season.
They see these territories as a dependent of fish and they get good fish because of their prevalence.
Toda, a small exciting community in the isolated areas of Nilgiri in southern India, has traditionally built their houses because of the things available in that area.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living very peacefully and in harmony with each other but if someone harms their natural resources, they will not hesitate to defend their rights.
It is not surprising that our early freedom fighters were the people of the tribal community.
Come on, let's express our respect for them.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat speaks of those who do extraordinary things for the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother of Punjab Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
One ordinary teacher, the farmer was married to Gurubachan Singh.
But you will be surprised to know that an ordinary farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh told the bridegroom's father that he had put forward the condition that it was the real power of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them, "Now I promise you not to burn the wheels in the field."
You can imagine how big social force it has.
It may seem simple that Gurubachan Singh ji had said this thing, but this thing tells us how elaborate his personality is, there are several families in our society that make personal matters a matter of social good.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh ji has presented such an example to us.
I read about another village of Punjab, the Kallar Majra near Nabha.
People of the Kallar Majra instead of burning the glasses, they merge it to the ground and use technology for it.
"Greetings to Shri Gurubachan Singh.
Congratulations to all those people who have been making great efforts to keep the environment clean and clean.
You are living as the true inheritors of Indian traditions of a healthy lifestyle.
It means peace in all the three worlds, either in the water, in the earth, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the fire, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the wind, in the medicines, in the plants, in the plants, in the gardens, in the forests, in the entire universe.
Peace be on the heart, on me, on the particles of the fire, everywhere.
For India, the First World War was a big event.
Clearly, we had no direct connection with the war.
Yet, our soldiers fought bravely, played a very big role and carried out great martyrdom.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not far behind when it came to war.
In the First World War, the world has witnessed a wave of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers and almost equally ordinary people have died.
Through this, the whole world understands the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony are not merely a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, we need to work together and work in harmony with each other.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the real symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our north-eastern region is different.
Its natural beauty is unique and its people are very talented.
Our north-eastern region is now known for a lot of goodwill.
The North-Eastern region has grown immensely in terms of organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim was awarded Kirtiket Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable availability.
It means food and agricultural organisations.
The awards given for outstanding policy formulation in the sector are equivalent to Oscars in the region.
Not only this, our Sikkim has won the award by following 51 nominated policies of 25 countries.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is ending.
There's a lot of change in the weather.
In a way, the month of November is the month of festivals like Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhayaduj and Chhath.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country, as an opportunity to move forward on a mission mode in your life.
