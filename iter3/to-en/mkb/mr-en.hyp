Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Enemy intellectual destruction Deepajyotirnamostte
I bow down to such Divyangjans.
What could be a better idea to remember this Deepawali than to spread light everywhere, to spread positiveness and to destroy the feeling of hostility
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community participates in it but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organizations of the country celebrate Diwali with full fervor.
In a way, India realizes that.
Friends, Festival tourism in the world itself was attractive.
Our India, which is a country of festivals, has immense potential for festival tourism.
We should strive to involve people from other states and other countries in the joy of festivals by spreading such festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu.
There are so many festivals in each of our states and regions that people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside India is very important in enhancing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, it was decided to do something different during this Diwali.
I had said - let all of us celebrate this Diwali as the women power of India and the accomplishments of all three, that is, the honor of Laxmi of India.
And see, immediately after this, innumerable inspiring stories began to flourish in the social media.
Codipka Ramesh from Warangal wrote on Namo App that my mother is my strength.
When my parents died in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today, we have five brothers in good business.
Ramesh ji, bow down to our mothers
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for him Major Khushboo is the Laxmi of India, who is the daughter of a bus driver and led all the women teams of Assam Rifles.
For Kavita Tiwari ji, Lakshmi ji of India is her daughter, who is also her strength.
They are proud that their daughters do good paintings.
She has also achieved a very good category in the CLAT examination.
Megha Jain has written that an old 92 year old woman provides free water to travellers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of Lakshmi in India.
People have narrated many such stories.
You must take inspiration and do something similar to yourself in your surroundings.
I bow down to all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, Sanchi Honam, a well-known poet of the 17th century, wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
The same feeling, the same word that we are talking about every Laxmi of India, it seems that its foundation stone was laid in the 17th century itself.
How beautiful words, how beautiful emotions and how excellent ideas are there in these poems of Kannada.
Our daughters, these are our pride and because of the glory of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and that future is bright.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day on which 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
The influence of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but in the entire world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have settled in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to Vancouver and Tehran's Gurudwara.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can tell you but for that there will be several parts of Mann Ki Baat.
He always kept the spirit of service at the top.
Guru Nanak Devji believes that the selfless service cannot be valued at all.
He stood firm against social evils like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji conveyed his message to the world, far and wide.
He was one of the greatest travelers of our time.
He visited many places and won the hearts of all through his simple nature, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Devji undertook several important religious voyages, which are called sadness.
Taking the message of goodwill and equality, whether it is north or south or east or west, everywhere people, saints and sages have met.
It is believed that the famous Saint Shankardev of Assam had also taken inspiration from him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
While travelling to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
In Bidar, there is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji who constantly reminds us of.
During an unhappiness, Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet where people considered him Guru.
They are revered in Uzbekistan, where they went.
During one of his distresses, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They were in the hearts of millions of people who followed their teachings and are still following them.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of nearly 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and this event marked the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these messengers not only visited the Golden Temple but also got the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Thereafter, several Ambassadors posted their photographs on social media and wrote proudly about the best experiences.
I wish that Guru Nanak Dev Jis 550th Prakash Parv will inspire us to bring his ideals and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that the date 31st October will certainly be remembered by all of you.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who was a great enthusiastic enthusiast of the country.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a unique ability to bring people together, on the other hand, he was able to keep pace with those who had ideological differences.
Sardar Patel looked at small things very deeply and took care of them.
In fact, he was the Man of Details who insisted on penance.
At the same time, he was a master of organisational skills.
In 1921, there were thousands of delegates from across the country to participate in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the systems of the session.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
It was decided that no one would have water shortage.
Moreover, he was supposed to visit a delegate's luggage or shoes at the convention site. And you will be surprised to know that Sardar Patel had taken care of it.
He urged the farmers to make Khadi pipelines.
The farmers made similar bags and sold them to the representatives.
They put their shoes in these bags and if they keep the bags with them then the pressure of the representative to steal the bag.
On the other hand, Khadi sales have grown substantially.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution.
They did a vital job to determine the fundamental rights, so that there was no discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done a great job of uniting the institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai ji had this unique feature that he looked at every incident.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, there was a discussion about certain regions in the country's integration.
He told Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar that he should take the people of Travancore to travel there immediately and flutter the tricolor there and flutter the first tricolor in Lakshadweep.
The tricolor was fluttered immediately after his orders and the neighbouring country was destroyed to capture Lakshadweep.
After the incident, Sardar Patel said that he should personally assure that Lakshadweep will get every necessary assistance for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to India's progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope that we will visit these beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, the statue of unity that was built in the memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October, 2018 was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the world's tallest statue.
It is the height of the effigy of the goddess of freedom in America.
The tallest statue in the world makes every Indian proud.
Every Indian is respected by the princes.
You will be glad that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the statue of unity.
This means that everyday 8,500 people will see the magnificence of the statue of unity.
He expressed his heartfelt devotion to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now there are several centres of attraction like Select Garden, Phulpakhuru Garden, Jungle Safari, Poshan Bhawan Park for children, Ekta Nursery etc.
Considering the facilities of the tourists coming, the people of many villages are providing facilities like home-stay facilities in their homes.
Professional training is also being provided to those who provide homeless amenities at home.
I am sure the people of this region have started the farming of dragon fruits and will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people of this region.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, the effigy of unity can be a subject of study.
We are all witnesses to the fact that how a place was developed in a year as a world famous tourist destination.
People from India and abroad come here.
Several facilities like transportation, lock-ups, guides, environmental supplements are being developed automatically.
There is a huge economic upheaval and people are facilitating it as per the needs of the travelers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, Last month, the effigy of unity has been placed in the top 100 tourist destinations of the world.
I hope that all of us will take some time out of our precious time to see the statue of unity.
However, I would urge that every Indian who takes time to travel to at least 15 tourist places in India should travel with his family and wherever he goes, he will stay in the night.
Friends, As you are aware, 31st October is celebrated every year since 2014 as National Unity Day.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country by paying us any price.
On 31st October, every year, Run for Unity - Unity Run is being organized.
In this, people from every section of the society, every section of the society will participate.
Run for Unity is a symbol of the fact that this country is one, moving in one direction and achieving a goal.
However, today people see a verse and a verse about the marathon.
Run for Unity is also a provision for the same.
We have also been running here for Fit India and along with Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And because of this, not only the body but also the mind and culture have to run to take India to new heights for India's unity.
You can enquire about the Run for Unity around you in the city where you live.
in, where Run for Unity is being organised across the country.
We will run on 31st October for the unity of India and for our own well-being.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has made the country united.
This mantra of unity is like a value in our lives and we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every juncture, at every juncture and at every juncture in a country full of diversity like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to empower the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court had given its verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi.
Just remember that day, what was the atmosphere
How many people had come to the ground
How the interest groups used to play games to take advantage of the situation.
What kind of language was used to feed the environment
Attempts were also made to fill in different voices.
On one hand, there was a need to create a two-week atmosphere but when the decision was taken in the Ram Janmabhoomi then the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects and saints gave a very moderate response.
Efforts to reduce the stress in the environment.
But I still remember that day.
These things should always be kept in mind and they give us a lot of strength.
This is an example of the strength that unity gives to the country.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed on 31st October.
I pay my homage to the nation today.
My dear countrymen, today some story is being heard in every household from far flung areas, every village may be listening to a story. The story of cleanliness is being heard in every corner of India from North to South, East to West.
Every individual, every family, every village wants to share its pleasant experience in terms of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 1. 25 billion Indians.
125 crore Indians are also the owners of their results.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
Let me also tell you what I have heard and what I am thinking.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature drops from zero to 50 degrees.
The air is called oxygen .
Staying in such a difficult situation is no less than a valour.
In such a scenario, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but are also running the Clean Siachen Campaign.
I compliment the people of our country for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that even some disruptions are difficult.
In such a scenario, segregation and management of waste is an important task.
In such a scenario, 130 tons of waste from the glacier and its surrounding areas and that too in such a deserted environment.
We all know that Siachen is a part that is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running the Swachhta Abhiyan here means ensuring clean water for those who live in the low-lying areas and also using water from rivers like Nubra and Shyak.
My dear countrymen, Festivals are a new festival of awakening in all our lives.
And in Diwali, especially in every family, something or the other is being purchased from the market.
The more we try to purchase local goods, the greater the 150th of Gandhi will be.
And I would urge you to buy something made by the hands of our weavers and the hands of our Khadiwala.
Even on this Diwali, we must have purchased a lot before Diwali.
However, there will be a lot of people who would think that if they go after Diwali then they will get a little cheaper.
There will be a lot of people who will still have their purchases.
While conveying the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to purchase local goods.
See how Mahatma Gandhis dream can play a vital role.
But sometimes there is a fire that remains unconscious.
There were wounds somewhere.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September, 2018
Every Indian, whether it is of any field, caste, religion, creed or language, is eager to express his joy and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We remembered the target-breaking attacks in 2016, when our soldiers reacted fondly to those who fought against terrorism.
In different parts of the country, our armed forces have performed exhibitions so that the maximum number of citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, know their strengths.
We will know how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by putting their lives at stake.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, I remind the youth of the glorious legacy of our Armed Forces and inspire us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is certain that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to those who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We believe in peace and we are committed to encouraging it but we never miss the value of respect and sovereignty of the country.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was a valour by our soldiers towards peace.
Even today, India is one of the fastest sending troops to the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our soldiers have played an important role in ensuring peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, the story of the sky is different.
One of the popular excitements in the Republic Day programme is the fly past in which our air forces select their capabilities by exhibiting leopards and airplanes.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
I heartily congratulate all the air warriors and their families who are serving the nation.
In 1947, when the Pakistani attacker launched an indirect attack, the Air Force itself asserted that Indian soldiers and materials would reach the battlefield in time to defend Srinagar.
The Air Force responded to the enemy even in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1971
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from smuggling in 1999.
On Tiger Hill, the air force dumped the enemies by showering a hailstorm overnight.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or disaster management, the country is grateful for the commendable performance of our Air Force personnel.
His work to tackle natural calamities from floods, floods to forest fires and help the countrymen is amazing.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of our departments for the girl child.
Now the Air Force is giving an alternative to the 'Permanent Commission' along with the Short Service Commission, which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that along with male power, women power is also contributing to our Armed Forces.
Women are not only empowered but they are also being armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our officers in the Navy was giving a befitting reply to the loss of lives.
The entire country was worried about how to save them.
You all are aware that Abhilash Tomy is a brave officer.
He is the first Indian officer to travel in the world by taking a small name from any modern technology.
Over the last 80 days, he was moving ahead at sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean. However, the Bay of Bengal cyclone created a crisis in front of him but the brave Indian Navy continued to swing over the sea for several days.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tomy and this courage, his valour, his determination and the power of winning will certainly inspire the young generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, even the little children are aware of the significance of 2nd October for our country.
The 2nd of October this year has a special significance.
Two years from now, we are going to organize several programmes across the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis ideas inspired the entire world.
Whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, the great genius, everyone gained strength from Gandhian thoughts and fought a long way to give our people the right to equality and dignity.
From today's Mann Ki Baat, I want to discuss another important work of revered Bapu which should be done by more and more people.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was undertaken, he made a remarkable impression.
Revered Bapu kept his thoughts before the countrymen on issues such as protecting the rights of farmers, villages, workers, cleanliness, spreading education etc.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a public collector.
It was his nature to connect people and to mix them.
Everyone must have experienced the uniqueness of his past.
He gave this experience to everyone that the person is the most important and absolute requirement for the country.
The biggest contribution of freedom fighters is that they made this struggle a mass movement.
Responsive to Mahatma Gandhis call for the freedom struggle, the people of every region and every section of the society humbled themselves.
Bapu had given you an inspirational mantra.
Can he gain control over his life and destiny
Whether it is possible for millions of people to get Swaraj, those who are hungry and their soul is unsatisfactory.
Then you will find that your apprehensions have started decreasing and your ego has started to finish.
My dear countrymen, a mantra of Gandhiji is still equally important.
Today, the middle class is growing in the country, the growing economic strength of the middle class, the rising purchasing power, some purchases, can we remember Bapu for a moment
Who would be fortunate, whose purchase would benefit directly or indirectly...
If the poorest of the poor benefits, I will be more happy.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind, while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji in the days to come, you must keep in mind that what kind of country should be built due to your purchase and that too which has caused our sweat, our money and our talent should be benefitted in some way or the other.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that this small step of yours can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest and the weakest.
But this was achieved, India got independence.
Similarly, today you can feel that my small work can also contribute to the economic progress of my country, economic empowerment and the poor to fight poverty.
In today's era, this is the true patriotism, this is the work of revered Bapu.
He said that all these Khadi clothes have been made with utmost hard work and every thread should be used.
The feeling of intimacy towards the country and affection towards the countrymen was different from that of a childhood gentleman.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji.
With the name of Shastri Ji, the feeling of infinite devotion flourishes in the hearts of our Indians.
His gentle personality is always a matter of pride for every Indian.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked humble from outside but he was determined to climb it.
The announcement of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is a recognition of his immense personality.
His selfless penance towards the nation was the result of that in a short span of about one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to scale new heights of success.
My dear countrymen, if we remember the revered Bapu today then it is natural that we will not remain without talking about cleanliness.
The Swachhata Hi Seva campaign was launched from 15th September.
Millions of people participated in it and I got the good fortune of Shramdaan with the students of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to that school whose foundation stone was laid by revered Baba Saheb himself.
People from all over the country participated in the Shramdaan on the 15th of this month.
Hiriri participated in the event.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSS, Youth organisations, Media Groups, Private Industry have done a lot of sanitation work.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these cleanliness lovers.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but in the entire world.
On this occasion, India is organising the largest Global Sanitation Convention in History, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
The Swachhta Ministers and experts from across the world are collectively sharing their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude on 2nd October, 2018 at the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit: "Justice, self-governance, justice is at the root of Swaraj. When there is a discussion of justice, the feeling of human rights is inherent in it.
This is specially essential for the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, the deprived and the deprived.
In the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar, provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was set up on October 12, 1993.
The NHRC will complete 25 years in a few days.
NHRC has worked towards enhancing human dignity along with protecting human rights.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister of the country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clarified that human rights are not a different concept for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, all the buildings of Vedic times have been depicted as Sukhinah.
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing misuse of human rights.
In this 25-year journey, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a promising thing for a healthy society and for a better democratic value.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the national level human rights work.
As a society, there is a need to understand the importance of human rights and behave in a manner that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
This year also, with your efforts, organise the Run for Unity in your village, city and metropolitan cities.
Run for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for unity throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society through the 'Run for Unity' on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, the festival of Rakhi Purnima is being celebrated across the country.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
Rakshabandhan is celebrated as a symbol of love and trust between sisters and brothers.
Janmashtami will also be celebrated soon.
The hailstorms like Hathi, Ghoda, Palki-Jai Kanhaiyalal, Govinda-Govinda will be spread everywhere.
The joy of going in the color of Lord Sri Krishna is different from that .
Sir Ad. Sanskrit - Dinmasti.
Sanskrit languages Sarala and Sarve Vadanti.
Brothers and sisters, Besides Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
We are proud that from time immemorial to the present, Sanskrit has played a very important role in the propagation of knowledge.
Sanskrit language and literature in this language have a rich wisdom about every field of life.
Moreover, the mantras that give a detailed answer to the challenges of today's global growth are also mentioned in Sanskrit.
You will be happy to know that residents of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language to speak.
You will be surprised to know that a special feature of Sanskrit language can create new words in this language.
It has been said in the Subhasita which explains how important Guru Namka is in life - Ekampi Akshramastu , Guru , the disciples of Guru .
My dear countrymen, the rainy season brings new hopes for our hardworking farmer brothers.
This is a boon for the sand, dry trees and the hailed reservoirs due to extreme heat.
But in some cases this very rain brings disastrous , catastrophic Mahapura .
Rainfall at most places with heavy falls at isolated places over the country.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity recover their health at the earliest.
But we see the philosophy of humanity even in times of crisis.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody can do whatever is possible at their own level, whether it is in Kerala or in any other district or region of India.
They did their best to save the lives of people trapped in the floods.
Whether it is the air force or the navy or the naval personnel, the Border Security Force, the CISF, the RAF, the Army have played a very important role in the rescue and relief operations.
We pray that the country, especially Kerala, gets the strength to come out of this crisis as soon as possible during this holy period of Onam and that the development journey of Kerala gets a boost.
Once again on behalf of all the countrymen, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and those places where there has been such a severe drought in the country that the entire country is with us.
For the last ten years, he had gone far from active politics.
But after 16th August, the country and the world saw that even after 10 years of age, Atal ji had a great affection for the common man.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation has led to two major changes in India's politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of States has been restricted to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limits prescribed under the Anti-Pacific Act were one-third, it was increased to two-thirds.
In addition, clear directions have also been fixed to ensure that the members who have been partisans are not eligible.
Atal ji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time for the country's budget was changed in the House.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time for making budgets in the Parliament to the earliest.
Some of the regulations of the Code enabled the tricolor to flutter public places.
This gave more and more Indians the opportunity to hoist the flag of our nation.
Atal ji has done a great job to bring our beloved Tricolor closer to the people.
In this regard, somebody is protesting, people are asking for their opinions.
He reiterated his resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India and paid tributes to all of you, Atal ji.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will further protect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had pronounced the sentence for five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
In Rajasthan, the courts there have been quick decisions regarding the atrocities of women in a similar manner.
The Act will play a pivotal role in preventing the atrocities committed against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
In this Monsoon Session of Parliament, all the members have come together with an ideal text.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country at the public level.
My dear countrymen, today the attention of millions and millions of Indians is being drawn to the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Asian Games are still on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
The number of medal winners for the country has gone up, especially some of our participants are participating in it, which indicates a very positive sign.
Take care of your well-being as it is a healthy, healthy country that can build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Greetings, I respect our feelings.
Everybody was amazed to see that Patna in Gujarat is the Rani ki Bau built in the eleventh century.
India's land is like a laboratory of engineering.
Several engineers in India have brought out these things that are possible only in concepts.
We have received such a gem in our tradition that shares the legacy of great engineers.
This is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Visvesvaraya.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam constructed by him on the Kaveri River still benefits lakhs of farmers and the people.
In Kutch, it is called Bhunga.
My families have seen and experienced 3 earthquakes.
I myself have experienced three earthquakes in this house.
But just go inside, you don't see any damage.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature and geographical location of this place.
After seeing that house, I was contemplated that even before ages, the engineers of that period had thought about the local situation and had constructed it in accordance with the situation so that the common man could be safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also think about the future.
Workshops should be conducted at places .
What should we learn in the changing times
What should people learn
How to connect
Disaster management has been a big task today.
The entire world has to face natural calamities.
How can we have a new form of structural engineering in such a scenario
How will there be different courses
What should students learn about it
Several such things should be thought of when Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of celebrations.
Besides, preparations for Diwali will also start.
You will continue to meet in Mann Ki Baat and keep talking about Mann Ki Baat.
At the same time, we will be working to take our country forward with all our hearts.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all
The citizens of some parts are still waiting for Varunraj.
India is vast and has diversity in it, but in this country, the king of Varun is sometimes showing his love and dislike.
In such a scenario, the most important responsibility is that we all should become nature-loving, nature-saving and nature-friendly.
If we become a nature-friend then the balance of nature-oriented things will automatically be obtained.
You must have seen this incident on television.
Actually it takes usually a few hours to return back after going to that cave .
Now they are not able to come out, they have taken shelter at a slight altitude in the cave.
However, it took them not for a couple of days but for 18 days it took them to stop.
Now you can imagine how his moments and moments would have been in a mental state when he faced direct death.
On the one hand, these children were swinging to the crisis and on the other hand, humanity in the whole world was united and manifesting the human qualities of God.
Specially, after seeing the very restraint of everyone, I feel that this is a learning, understanding and learning quality.
Those whose daughters were stuck, their parents did not feel sad, nor did they suffer from tears due to sadness.
But the peaceful behavior of the entire society by maintaining patience and patience is a matter of great importance.
A Thai Navy soldier had to lose his life in this entire operation.
They showed the bravery and patience of helping the cave holders in extremely difficult situations, full of water and darkness.
This incident demonstrated that when humanity was united, such wonderful things happened.
But for that, we need to focus only on peaceful and stable mindsets and on those goals that we are working for.
A few days ago, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji had a special characteristic.
He had great faith in himself along with hope, faith and determination.
Everything of Neeraj ji can prove to be inspiring and inspiring for all the Indians.
Thus, the months of July and August are very important for all the farmer brothers and youngsters.
Because there is a problem of admission to colleges during this period.
Millions of youth like Satyam get out of school and go to colleges.
Youngsters take steps on a new path of life and when our focus comes out of the question then they come up with a cut-off.
The focus of the students is now on the hostels.
Students come out of the umbrella of their parents and come under the umbrella of their teachers.
I am sure that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, you should leave your homes and leave your villages and go to other places. You must leave your homes in a safe environment and become yourself a chariot.
Many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
I would like to tell all of you that stay calm and enjoy this life.
You have to study but you have to maintain the natural eagerness of finding new things while learning.
Old friends have a special value.
A student named Asharam Chaudhari from a poor family of Madhya Pradesh was witnessing the news about how academic achievements had been achieved in the life of a student.
The entrance examination of MBBS for AIIMS, Asharam Jodhpur has already been completed in the first attempt.
Similarly, Anushka Pandey, a Divyang Kanya from Gurgaon, is born with a genetic disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
All of them have achieved this thing with their determination and with every difficulty faced by the world.
If we look around, we will find many such examples.
Any good event in any part of the country, in every corner of the country, keeps giving me energy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my sight fell on a news item and wrote, Two youngsters had fulfilled the dreams of Modi.
On reading the news, we realized that today our youngsters are using technology to bring about changes in the lives of the common man.
The incident was such that San Jose City in the United States was considered as the hub of technology and once I was interacting with the Indian youth there.
At that time I urged them to think about how you can use your wisdom for your India and do something new after taking some time out.
I had called for the brain-drain problem to be answered by brain-gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji accepted my call and brought out an innovative imagination.
With the help of our professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have together created a SmartGov App.
This App not only connects the people of the village to the entire world but also provides information and information on our mobile phones through this App.
Residents of Taudakpur village in Rae Bareli, Gram Pradhan Sarpanch, District Penalty Officers, Chief District Officers, all have created awareness among the people about the use of this app.
Well, you say that this is a wonderful journey of Pandharpur.
Friends, This year, on the 23rd of July this year, the festival of Warri is celebrated in Pandharpur with a lot of devotion.
Pandharpur is a holy city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
In the footsteps of the great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, Warkari walks towards Pandharpur while embracing the Thaun Vithal Nama.
Vithal, also known as Vithoba or Pandurang, the pilgrims reach Pandharpur for their philosophy.
It is a deity that protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect for Panduranga.
Go to the temple of Vithoba in Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
Important messages of goodwill, love and brotherhood have been given from the literature of these saints.
The Saints gave a mantra to strengthen the society against blind faith.
And he had always done the job of eliminating old evils from the society, he had compassion, equality and a culture of integrity in the minds of the people.
Lokmanya Tilak i. e.
The British tried their best to prove the charges of sedition three times in 20 years.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen a furious incident related to the effigy of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
During that period, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad for his reception and during this visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel got the opportunity to interact with Tilak Ji.
The personality of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak was very impressed by the ideas.
On 1st August, 1920, when Lokmanya Tilak was attacked, Patel decided to build a memorial at Tilak in Ahmedabad.
Lastly, a statue of Tilak was made and Sardar Saheb inaugurated the memorial on 28 February 1929 by Mahatma Gandhi, not from anyone else.
My dear countrymen, this effigy is as rare as it is, Lokmanya Tilak has settled on a chair and has written 'Swaraj Hamara Janmadhi Rahman' on the bottom of Tilak.
Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium of social awareness, collective action, equality and equality among the people along with traditional devotion and devotion.
Thus, there was a need to fight against the British in that particular period.
And because of the festivals organised by Tilak, they worked to unite everyone by breaking the walls of the sects.
The popularity of organising these festivals has increased during the time. It is evident from the fact that the brave heroes of our ancient traditions and history are very attractive to today's younger generation.
Today, in many cities and in almost every street, a pavilion of Ganesh festivals is visible.
The Ganapati festival is organized by all the families of the streets together.
Young people get good opportunities here too, their leadership, festival organizers, program organizers and coordinators can develop their qualities.
Everything from the idol of Ganesh ji to decorative things should be environment friendly.
Today, every Indian needs to get good results of good governance and development.
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad brought his life back to life but he never came under foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit this village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh, the village of Chandrashekhar Azad.
I also had the opportunity to pay my homage to the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, who had pledged that Chandrashekhar Azad would not be a brave freedom fighter but would continue to fight till the end of his life.
This was a special feature of him.
Once again I salute these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, India's brave daughter Hima Das, a genius from a landmark, won a gold medal in the 400m event of the Geographical Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, has sent me an e-mail from Indonesia in response to my letter, and is preparing for the Asian Games at the moment of unity.
In our e-mail, it has been written that the most important moment in the life of any athlete is the moment when a player catches a tricolor in his hand.
Unity, we all are proud of you.
We are proud of you for making your country bright.
In Tunisia, World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 has won Gold and Bronze medals.
We have to move forward, we have been playing and developing.
My dear countrymen, several historical events have taken place in the month of August and several festivals also take place this month but due to the monsoon season sometimes the household becomes sick.
Once again I will meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, I am once again fortunate to have an interaction with you through Mann Ki Baat programme.
A few days ago, there was a historic combat of cricket in Bangalore.
You must have noticed that I would like to talk about the cricket criteria between India and Afghanistan.
The two sides witnessed a very good sporting performance in this fight.
Rashid Khan, an Afghan warlord, had done a very good job in IPL this year.
I thank our Indian friends for providing a platform to our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Whatever is best and best in Afghanistan, the same representative is there.
We came across an incident of sportspersonship and sportsmanship.
Sports is a very good medium to unite the society and to showcase the skills and talents of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will continue to develop and play with each other in a similar way in sports.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, the fourth Yoga Day was a different vision.
Whether it is the European Parliament, the UN headquarters in New York or the Japanese Navy's fighter ship, people used to see Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic Yoga programme and I came to know that the women had guided many asanas on this occasion.
India and China have jointly practiced Yoga on the high altitude snowy mountain peaks in Ladakh.
It is working to bridge the boundaries and connect everyone.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have celebrated Yoga Day in a big way in the wake of discrimination like caste, religion, region, colour or gender.
If people from all over the world were so enthusiasticly participating in Yoga Day programmes, then would it not be an excitement to showcase their cakes in India
Our country's security forces have performed Yoga at three locations - Army, Navy, Air Force.
Some brave soldiers performed Yoga on Paanbudi.
Some soldiers performed Yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our Air Warriors surprised everyone by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground.
It is to be said that he did Yoga while sitting in the plane, he did Yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports fields, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has done the work of uniting people all over the world by crossing the boundaries of caste, creed and geography and we have been living the world by keeping the spirit of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' in mind since ancient times.
Our Rishis, Muni and Saints have always emphasized on this idea.
Today, Yoga has been demonstrated in a proper manner by proving it.
I believe that today the idea of Wellness is working as a revolutionary.
We see Mother as a god, we consider her as a god and it is our culture.
Sometimes doctors give us reproduction .
The role of doctors is not limited to medication alone.
Not only do the doctors have medical knowledge but they also have a very good experience about the impact of their lifestyle and the impact of their lifestyle on their health.
Indian doctors have displayed their unlimited capabilities and skills and have created a unique identity in the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens on the eve of Dr.
India has a rich history.
When I was in Gujarat, when I was working there, people from the tradition of Saint Kabir had organized a massive national convention.
In the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, Saint Kabir Das had taken a tomb.
But do you know that Kabir Das ji had chosen this place for a burial
At that time, it was believed that the person who dies here does not find a place in heaven.
On the contrary, those who commit suicide in Kashi go to heaven.
However, Sant Kabir Das had no faith in such things.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through goodwill and compassion.
This was his ideal.
This is the ideal that we see from their creations.
This means that the person who considers the suffering of others to be the true fakir, the saint.
And those who do not know the sorrows of others are loyal.
Kabir Das ji emphasised on social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time.
The knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and they should be respected.
Even after such a long time, Kabir's words are equally effective.
Today we have read and heard the stories of Kabir ji.
We feel that his thoughts are relevant even today.
When we talk about Saint Kabir Das Ji, I remember one of his friends, in which he says: Guru Gobind Dou Gate, Kake Applicable
One such great Guru is Jagatguru-Guru Nanakdev.
They have shown the way to millions and millions of people, they have been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the poor and the needy are serving God.
Wherever he went, he worked for the betterment of the society.
In such a scenario, a person belonging to any caste, creed and sect can eat in the kitchen of kitchens that are free from social discrimination and Guru Nanak Dev started the langar system.
Guru Nanak Devji will celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
The horrific incident in Jallianwala Bagh will mark 100 years of its existence in 2019, which was going to blow the entire humanity black.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always victorious.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on his Jayanti and in today's programme, I will pay tributes to Dr.
During 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had contributed a lot.
West Bengal was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of the country.
Well, let's talk about Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video calls.
It can be said that they have got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of people by going beyond the files.
In remote and inaccessible villages, the young women are providing services through Common Service Centres (CSCs) to the elderly people of the villages, from wages to passports.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister used to collect Sitafall and manufacture her ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing medicines at affordable prices in the nearby villages.
I am delighted that the success of the common man is greater than the success of the government in this entire programme, the success of the common man is the true strength of this country.
In such a disappointing environment, I would like to share with you the hopes, new zeal and the events that have taken place in the lives of the common man.
The incident of a small girl from a small village in the remote and remote areas also inspires 125 crore Indians.
With the help of technology, a moment spent with the beneficiaries through video bridge has become extremely pleasant and inspiring for me.
It gives new joy, new zeal and new inspiration to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge programme and they gave me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you for this thing.
On the one hand there are professionals and technologists, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters working in the fields.
Now you must be wondering that agriculture and technology are two different businesses, what is their relationship
Plans were being formulated and their successful efforts were made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, from the production of crops to its marketing, the role of farmers is important and on the other hand, it is also trying to ensure the participation of the farmers in the profits.
Friends
This work that you have done in your youth is really going to inspire youngsters.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
I would like to give maximum credit to the states for bringing about One Nation, One Tax reforms.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example in which all the states together took decisions for the benefit of the country and thereafter tax reforms were made possible at such a large scale in the country.
Till date, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and people from different political ideologies come together.
There were 17 different types of taxation systems in the country before the GST but now only one tax system has been introduced in the new system.
GST is a victory of honesty and it is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier there were complaints regarding Inspector Raj in tax cases several times.
GST may be the biggest tax reform in the world.
Generally, a period of 5-7 years would have been possible to improve the number of such a massive population and stabilize the entire scheme in a complete manner.
Namaskar had recently organized 21st Commonwealth Games in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
Whenever there is such an environment, one can remain untouched by it.
This was the time when people across the country had to think about which sportspersons would be playing today.
How many medals would you win, how many medals would be India's achievements
Our sportspersons also performed well by fulfilling the expectations of the countrymen and won a medal after a while.
Whether it is bravery, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton India has achieved the best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze - India has earned a total of 66 Medals.
Every Indian is proud of this achievement.
Winning a medal is a matter of pride and happiness for every sportsperson.
It is a matter of great pride for all the countrymen.
Perhaps my words will be reduced to express that feeling.
But I would like to tell you what I have heard from these players.
This is the reason why there were many things that happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won a medal in all the competitions.
She is the first Indian female sportsperson to win Indias first gold medal in the individual table tennis event.
India won the highest number of medals.
15-year-old Indian cinematographer AnishBharao became the youngest player to win the Gold in the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Indian para power elevator to win a Commonwealth Games medal.
This time the sports competition was also special because most of the medal winners were women.
Whether it is squash or boxing or weightlifting or nambaji, women sportspersons have performed well.
Everyone was anxious about this war and both medals would be received by India.
The sportspersons from different parts of the country had come from small towns.
His friends are also contributing, who have raised his patience in every situation.
Last month in Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen, especially our youth, to Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India, represent Fit India.
And I am very happy that people are participating in it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have expressed their support by writing letters, have sent letters, have shared their health mantra on social media - Fit India Story.
One of the households, Shashikant Bhosale, shared his portraits of the reservoir. My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I am happy and healthy because of the morning walk.
And further they say - For me - fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that Debnath ji is healthy in happiness.
Sharing his photograph of mountaineering, Dhawal Prajapati wrote: "To me, the journey and mountaineering is the Fit India".
I am very happy to see that many well-known personalities are encouraging our youth in a very attractive manner for Fit India.
Film actor Akshay Kumar shared a video on the Twitter.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences while participating in Fit India.
I believe that such movements are extremely beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
One more thing I will definitely say - 'Yoga' is the name of Fit India Movement without spending any money.
The significance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June is now being accepted by the entire world.
You will also be ready from now on.
Your city, your village, your department, your school, your college, every individual, every person of any age, whether male or female, should try to participate in Yoga.
Today, I would like to invite you for a new work and I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new at this time.
My young friends, I urge you to participate in a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, Human Resource Development or Drinking Water Department, have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Students from colleges, youngsters from NCC, youth from NSS, youth from Nehru Yuva Kendras, who want to do anything, who want to participate in bringing about changes in the society, want to become a part of it
And when we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will enjoy doing something in the society. And I would also like to say that the best trainees who have done good work in colleges, those who have done excellent work in universities, all these will be given national awards.
Moreover, the UGC will provide two credit points to the trainees who will complete this.
I once again invite students, students and youngsters to take advantage of this internship.
You can register on MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youngsters will certainly succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us use these holidays as an opportunity to gain a new experience.
This group of youngsters has launched a massive campaign to educate children on roads and slums.
Initially, due to the circumstances of the children who asked for roadblocks or those who did small things, they shook themselves in this work.
Starting from 15 children in the nearby slums of Gita Colony in Delhi, this campaign has now reached to 2000 children in 12 locations in the capital.
Young teachers associated with this mission have participated in this commendable effort to bring about social change by taking two hours out of their busy routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have been a source of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
They have changed the fate not only of their own but also of our region through collective efforts.
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, maize or barley crops are taken mainly in Mandwa, Chowlait.
They started making biscuits from this farm crop and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative society in Munnar village and have opened a factory to produce biscuits there.
Taking into account the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only to the fifty Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs but it has also reduced the migration from the district due to the employment opportunities being provided to more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be war for water in the world in the future.
Everyone talks about this thing but is it not our responsibility
Do we not feel that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Every person should have the responsibility.
Over the centuries our ancestors have demonstrated this.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have discovered new ways to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu may have seen that in some temples of Tamil Nadu, a lot of writings have been written in the temples about irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, all of you will get to see big shots.
Even today, various bihiris are popular as tourist destinations but we should not forget that these are the living evidences of the water conservation campaign of our ancestors.
In Gujarat, the queen of Adlaj and Patan has a UNESCO world heritage and its grandeur is worth seeing.
Vihiri is in a way a water temple .
If you go to Rajasthan then you will definitely visit Chand Vihar in Jodhpur.
This is India's largest and well-known Virgin and most importantly, it is located in the areas where there is water scarcity.
April, May, June, July is the best time to harvest rain water. And if we prepare before then we will get the maximum benefit.
MNREGA funds are also used for this water conservation work.
In the last three years, everyone has made their own efforts towards water conservation and water conservation.
In addition to the MNREGA fund every year, an average of 32 thousand crore rupees has been spent on water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, out of total expenditure of 64 thousand crore rupees, about 35 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation.
In the last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by such water conservation and water management measures.
The District Administration under MGNREGA has taken up the responsibility of large-scale land and water conservation.
This dry river has been revived with the help of people from around 40-45 villages.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture or villages, this is a big achievement.
I would like to say that once again, April, May, June and July are before us. We should take some responsibility for water conservation, we should also formulate some schemes and we should do something.
When Mann Ki Baat is there, I get messages, letters and phones from all sides.
Ian Kumar Banerjee from Devitola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written on MyGov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know the philosophy of living the life of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore peacefully, beautifully and sincerely.
Please deliberate on the subject in Mann Ki Baat programme that people will get to know about it.
I express my gratitude to Iyenji for drawing the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was a personality full of knowledge and wisdom, whose writing has unfolded on everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented, multi-dimensional person but he was a teacher every moment.
I was habituated to listening to Rabindra Sangeet on the radio in the morning. And when Anandaloke and Agunar and Poroshmani got the opportunity to recite this poem then I got a new consciousness.
You too must have influenced Rabindra Sangeet and his poetry.
I pay my homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The holy month of Ramzan will begin in a few days.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with full devotion and respect all over the world.
The collective purpose of everyday life is that when a person is hungry, he also feels the hungry of others.
When he feels himself thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammed.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once a person asked the Prophets: What is good in Islam
The Prophet Saheb said, Whether you know them or not, to provide food to the poor and the needy and to interact closely with everyone.
Mohammed believed in knowledge and compassion.
They were not arrogant about anything.
They used to say that ego defeats knowledge.
Mohammed believed that a person is not due to his wealth but because of his sacred soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people all over the world.
Remembering Lord Buddha, this Buddha Purnima reminds us of the responsibility of following the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration for equality, peace, unity and fraternity.
These are human values which are the most important in today's world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar insisted that Lord Buddha had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb empowered millions of people be it dalits, oppressed, exploited or deprived through accidents.
There can be no greater example of compassion.
Karuna was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha to understand the grief of the people.
It is said that the Buddhist monks traveled to different countries, taking along with them the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha and it always happens.
Throughout Asia, the legacy of Lord Buddha's teachings has been obtained.
Many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar have deepened many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings. And that is why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect important Buddhist destinations in Southeast Asia to important Buddhist destinations in India.
I am glad that the Government of India is a partner in the revival of several Buddhist temples, including the beautiful Ananda Temple in Bagan, Myanmar, hundreds of years ago.
Today, the world is witnessing conflicts and human misery, the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to end evil.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have faith in Lord Buddha and have faith in the principles of compassion all over the world.
Lord Buddha seeks blessings for the entire world so that we can fulfill our obligation to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lord Buddha, it is believed that laughing Buddha brings good fortunes but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in India's defence history.
Now you are wondering what is the relationship between smiling Buddha and India's military power
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1998, a nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan.
Twenty years have passed since that incident and this test was conducted on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias test was successful and thus India showed its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked in the history of India as its military strength.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when we are strong as a country, we live peacefully with everyone.
As nuclear tests were conducted in the month of May, 1998, this month is not only important for the country but it is important for the country to do so.
This incident has shown to the entire world that the land of India is the land of great scientists and India can scale new heights with a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
When we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 11th May, 1998, we will imbibe the mantra of 'Jai Vigyan' that Atal ji had given us for India's strength and make a solemn pledge to contribute to the building of a modern India, to build a strong India and to build a strong India.
Inculcate your strength in the strength of India.
We can also derive a new pleasure and a new satisfaction to take the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, visit the next episode of Mann Ki Baat and shout.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
A few days ago, on 26th January, when all the heads of ASEAN countries had come here, the art teams of that country had also come here with them.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of their countries presented the Ramayana to us.
It means that Ram and Ramayana are equally effective and inspiring not only in India but also in ASEAN countries.
I once again convey my best wishes to you all for Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, as usual, I have received your letters, emails, phone calls and responses in large numbers.
I have read what Komal Thakkar has written about the launch of Sanskrit online on MyGov.
I read a copy of Shri Dhanshyam Kumar ji from Barkar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on the Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed on the depletion of land degradation is of course very important.
Sriyut Shakal Shastri ji from Karnataka wrote very carefully that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when it is Ayushman Bhoomi.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji has said that I should talk about the health of the youth.
According to him, if we compare with other Asian countries, Indian youth are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I thought that this time I will talk to everyone about health in detail - Strong India.
Prashant ji, the Government of India shared all those photos and videos on the same day on social media and Narendra Modi App.
Now please lick that photo and retweet it and send it to your friends.
From Chennai, Angah, Jayesh and many other children have written to me about the thoughts they have received in their minds on the gratitude cards they have given behind the book "Exam Warrior".
I would like to tell you all, Angah, Jayesh and all the other kids, that your letters keep me tired of my whole day.
So many letters, so many phone calls and reactions, whatever I can read, whatever I can hear, all these things have got into my mind.
Even if I decide to tell you the same thing today, I will have to say the same thing for months or months.
More and more letters have been sent to the children on this occasion.
I have told you your planets on vacations.
We are concerned that the animals and birds do not get water in the summer.
Farmers brothers and sisters have sent letters to the farmers regarding farming fairs and all the things that are happening in the country.
Some awakening citizens have suggested measures for water conservation.
Ever since we have started this Mann Ki Baat through radio, I have experienced a method and since then more and more letters come to the topics related to summer.
Students are observed to be observed before examination.
It means that things of mind change according to the weather and perhaps it is the truth that these things of our minds can change the weather in somebody else's life.
When I got to read in your letters how Ahmed Ali, the Rescue Director of Karimganj, Assam, built nine schools for poor children with the help of his will power, then I saw the indomitable will power of our country.
When I heard about Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary of Kanpur, he used to go to the pavement to feed the poor and treat them free of cost then I got the opportunity to feel the brotherhood of the country.
Several travellers travelling in their cabs helped a lot.
An engineer girl gave her first full salary.
Thus, after 12 years of submission, success has been achieved in the efforts of Shri Abdul Laskar.
Today, due to his determination and hard work, he has constructed a sicklehouse with a provision of about 30 beds in the village of Punari near Kolkata.
Today, the vision of the entire world towards India has changed.
Today, when the name of India is taken with great pride, then it is the strength of these sons and daughters of Mother India.
A positive atmosphere of hope and confidence has emerged.
This self-confidence, this positivity will fulfil our resolution of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for our farmer brothers and sisters.
Be it Mahatma Gandhi or Shastriji or Lohiaji or Chaudhary Charan Singh ji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, all of them consider both agriculture and farmers as an integral part of the country's economy and general life.
Lal Bahadur Shastri also emphasized on the protection of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies, innovation and use them and stressed upon the need for it.
This state, which has a very small area, has made great strides.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have recorded record production during 2015-16 over the last five years.
They have proved that when the goals are certain, when there is a determination and will power to realize them then they can fulfil them with their experience.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget so that the farmers get the right price.
It has been decided that the notified crops will be guaranteed at least one and a half times of their production cost.
As per the detailed mention, the cost of production that will be incurred for guarantee, the wages of the labourers who work on the farm, the wages and expenses of the cattle, the cost of equipment, the cost of seeds, the cost of all types of fertilizers used, the land revenue paid to the state government, the interest paid on the capital, the rent of the land on the farm is not only the lease of the land but also the cost of the farmer who works for himself or his family, the value of his labour will also be added to the cost of production.
Besides, the work of improving the agricultural markets across the country is also going on at a rapid pace to ensure that the farmers get better market access.
Efforts are being made to bring together local mandis, wholesale markets and global markets in the villages.
In order to ensure that farmers do not have to go far enough to sell their produce, they are being modernized by providing the necessary infrastructure to 22,000 rural markets in the country and thereafter they will be linked to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee and e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect agriculture to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is not only our resolution but also how can we bring together 125 crore citizens to pay a best wishes to Gandhiji
How should Gandhi 150 be the logo of the theme
We should collectively pay our homage to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him and take our country to a new height.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a traditional approach in the field of health.
Earlier it was believed that the Ministry of Health had the responsibility of doing all the work related to health in the country.
But now all the Ministries and Departments, be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Department of Chemicals Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, all the departments are working together for a healthy India.
Preventive health care is the cheapest and easiest way of life.
Therefore, we will get more benefits to the individuals, family and society as much as possible to take care of health.
Besides, work is going on at a large scale to set up healthcare centres across the country.
In the field of preventive healthcare, Yoga has created a new identity in the world today.
The body remains healthy and strong by yoga .
Due to the commitment of Yoga for all of us, Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This year, the International Day of Yoga i. e.
In the last three years, people participated in the International Day of Yoga in a very enthusiastic manner everywhere in the country and around the world.
This year too, we should do Yoga ourselves and inspire our entire family, friends and others to do Yoga.
In a new, attractive way, we have to make Yoga more popular by reaching out to children, youth and senior citizens and women and men of every age group.
Otherwise, the country's television and electronic media has been conducting various programmes on Yoga throughout the year.
But can we do some programmes that can create awareness about Yoga from today to Yoga as a campaign
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga practitioner but a Yoga practitioner.
However, some people have made me a Yoga practitioner by using their innovations and have made some 3D animated videos.
I will be able to share with you this video pouchvan that we can practice asanas and pranayama.
Today, more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
Work is underway to set up more new centres.
My request to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat is that they should ensure that the information of these Jan Aushadhi Kendras is delivered to the needy, that is, their medicines will be very low and their services will be great.
The cost of stents required for heart patients has been reduced by 85.
The prices of knee implants have been regulated to 50-70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, nearly 10 crore households, that is, about 50 crore citizens are going to get treatment worth Rs. 5 lakhs in a year, along with insurance companies.
The total number of seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in different states to provide better treatment and better healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new Medical College will be set up for every three districts.
We aim to make the entire country TB-free by 2025.
This is a very big task.
Every individual needs to be awakened and you need help for that.
To get rid of TB all of us will have to work together.
My dear countrymen, on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country.
They believe that the poorest of the poor can also be provided employment because of the industries.
Today, Make in India campaign is being successfully launched in the country.
In such a scenario, the dream that Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of becoming an industrial superpower is inspiring us.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the world's economy, the world's largest foreign direct investment is being made in India.
The entire world is looking at India as a hub for investment, research and development.
Keeping this in mind, the Smart City Mission and the Urban Mission have been launched to provide good roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in the big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
It was not acceptable to them that someone should lead a life in poverty.
Besides, he also believed that the poor would not be able to get rid of their poverty by providing them with some thorough facilities.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start Up India, Stand Up India are developing young innovators and young entrepreneurs in the country.
He had seen Jal Shakti as a nation power.
The importance of waterways in the development of the country was emphasized and it was Babasaheb's vision to set up several river basin authorities and different water related commissions.
Today, a historic effort is being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are being developed on different sea shores of India and infrastructure in old ports is being strengthened.
In the forties, there were major issues of discussion, others were wars, cool wars and divisions.
In a way, Dr. Ambedkar had laid the foundation of the spirit of Team India.
He spoke of the importance of federalism and emphasized the need for the Union and States to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federalism in every department of the government and competitive cooperative federalism.
And most importantly, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of backward classes like me.
He showed us that there is no need to be born in a reputed family or a gentleman to move forward in life. He also showed us that those who are born in a poor family in India can make efforts to fulfil those dreams.
Sometimes many people took the help of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward classes.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan will be organised from 14th April to 5th May, 2019, to mark the birth anniversary of Dr.
It will have a wide range of programmes on subjects such as rural development, poor welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge you all to participate in this programme in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days, several festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi are coming up.
Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti is a day to learn from his sacrifice and penance.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who gave the message of non-violence, are inspiring for all of us.
Greetings to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
The Easter said that the Lord remembers the inspiring teachings of Jesus and gave the message of peace, goodwill, justice, compassion and compassion for mankind.
In April, Baisakhi festival is celebrated in Punjab and West India.
Thanks a lot
We have seen that the sea looks blue but in everyday life we feel that the water is colorless, it does not have any color.
Have we ever thought of the rivers, the seas or the waters in it
This question was raised in the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
A great scientist of modern India emerged from this question.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
Raman Effect is known for his discovery.
On 28th February, Raman had discovered Light Scattering and hence we celebrated 28th February as National Science Day every year for his Nobel Prize for this discovery.
This country has given several great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there was a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhatta while on the other hand Surat and Charaka are places of pride in healthcare.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Govind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose, scientists are Indias pride.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the famous Boson Crop has also been given the name.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme at the Wadhwani Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles in science.
Artificial intelligence helps in manufacturing robots and machines.
Nowadays machines are smartening their intellect by self-schooling.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor, the deprived and the needy easier.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to use artificial intelligence to make life easier for the Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can we imagine the natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, with the Israeli Prime Minister, I had the opportunity to visit Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There was a young man who had developed a digital device that he could not speak. A silent person had written to him that his voice was transformed. And he can communicate with this person just like he used to speak to a person.
I believe that in many such places we can use artificial intelligence.
Machines work as you wish.
But what we want to do from the machines depends on us.
The human endeavour here is important, the use of science for human welfare, the use of science for attaining the highest levels of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the light of electricity, was often misused in many of his experiments.
Asked about this, he told them that 10,000 methods of electric lights have been discovered by me, that is, Edison has strengthened his necessity.
Today, I am here in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and asked for responsibilities against their rule.
As a great sage, he raised questions about every aspect of his life.
He showed the path to humanity by finding the answer.
The spirit of repeated questions is important to know the truth.
Behind scientific exploration this true dilemma is also the inspiration .
We should not stay healthy until we find answers to what and how these questions can be solved.
On National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to all those associated with our scientific and scientific field.
May our younger generation be inspired for the discovery of truth and knowledge and motivate them to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, There are many messages to me on the issue of dysentery, during the time of crisis, on the issue of security and disasters.
From Pune, Rabindra Singh has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App on the subject of Professional Safety.
He writes that the quality of safety at factories and construction sites in our country is not as good.
On the occasion of Indias National Safety Day on March 4, the Prime Minister will take up the topic of Safety in his Mann Ki Baat programme, which will enhance awareness among the people about safety.
When we talk about public safety, two things are important, readiness and preparation.
Safety is of two types one which is essential during disasters and the other is essential in daily life.
We were not aware of safety in our daily lives but it was difficult to achieve safety during disasters.
If we are consistent, follow the required rules then we can save our lives and save our society from the worst accidents.
We see that there are many things written about safety at workplace but that does not seem to be the same.
The municipal corporations who have fire engines should go to different schools every week or month to drill a mock drill in front of students.
It will have two benefits, the Fire Services will also have a habit of staying alert and the new generation will get education in this regard. And it will not be necessary to spend differently but in a way it will become a part of education.
India has geographically diversified itself in terms of disasters and disasters.
The country has witnessed some natural, man-made, disaster and chemical and industrial accidents.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on disaster management in the country.
Disaster-related NDMAs such as earthquakes, floods, plains and landslides are running fast.
Training and awareness have an important role to play.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives in the heat wave every year, after that NDMA launched a campaign to create awareness about it, organised workshops.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
Fire Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces and Armed Forces, the brave soldiers of the Armed Forces do not sacrifice their lives in times of distress and help the people.
NCCs and scouts also assist in this work and provide training.
This was the first and most comprehensive endeavour in the joint disaster management exercise of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Nepal.
These values should become an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in this budget, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the emphasis has been laid on producing energy from waste to waste through biogas.
The initiative has been launched with the name of Gobar Dhan, Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from poultry and biological fertilizers but it has not been fully utilized in India.
We are moving in this direction in the direction of Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen.
The target is to utilise livestock dung, farm waste and kitchen waste to generate biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmers of rural India will be encouraged to look at the dung and waste as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in cleaning the villages.
It will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
Garbage, transportation and sale of biogas will enhance employment opportunities.
An online platform will be created for the proper implementation of the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers with the consumer and will get a fair price for the poultry and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India, to take the initiative by creating a Self Help Group, by creating a cooperative societies.
I invite you to become a partner in this movement for clean energy and green employment, to convert the waste of our villages into wealth and to convert dung into wealth.
Different types of art works have been developed using waste.
Workshops were organized to train people on all aspects of waste management.
Everyone put forth innovative ideas about cleanliness, performed churches, presented poems.
A festive atmosphere was created in the field of cleanliness.
Particularly schoolchildren participated in it.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation and the people of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the festival was celebrated on the issue of waste management and cleanliness.
Each year, 8th March is celebrated as International Womens Day.
Several programmes are organized in the country and around the world.
Women who have done remarkable work in different fields are honoured on this day.
Today, the country is moving ahead with the development of women under the leadership of women.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's ideas. He had said, Ideal women's concept is complete freedom.
Twenty-five years ago, Swami ji's thoughts reflect the strength of women in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every sphere of social and economic life.
We are a part of a tradition where men are recognized by women, the son of Yashoda, the son of Kaushalya, the son of Gandhari.
Women are empowered, empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of New India.
A few days ago, a person had suggested a good thing to me. He said that on 8th March, several programmes are being organized on Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis 50 thousand Raj Mistry.
You can imagine what a big event it is.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is a force of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into a habit of masses in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I got the news that electricity had reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence.
You know, this island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai.
For 70 years, there was darkness in the lives of people in three villages like Rajbandar, Morbandar and Set Port.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves of Elephanta are now lit up.
This is not just a new beginning but a new beginning.
What can be a matter of greater joy than the brightness of the lives of the countrymen and their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We have just celebrated Maha Shivratri.
The unique feature of the month of March is the glimpse of the rice and nutritious ammunition.
We love this month for the celebration of Holi.
Holi will be celebrated across the country on 2nd March.
The importance of Holi is equally important for Holika Dahan.
May this festival bring joy to the lives of our people.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
This year, for the first time in 2018, we are interacting with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Two days ago, we celebrated Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
The event was attended by the Chief Guests from ten countries, for the first time in history.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathy.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that women are making progress in every sector in India, they are moving forward and the values of the country are rising.
It is a matter of great pride for the women of our country since ancient times and their contribution to the society.
There is a great tradition of great devils in India.
Several adversaries in India have contributed significantly to the creation of Vedas.
Lopadamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi and many other names can be taken.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the entire society and her family in the spirit of unity.
Whether it is a great scholar like Lopadumra, Gargi and Maitreyi of the Vedic times or a saint of great enlightenment and devotion like Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai, or a saint in the system of governance like Ahilyabai Kohl or a brave Ranaji like Rani Lakshmibai, women power has always inspired us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He has written that the journey of our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman from the Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft will inspire him.
Mohna Singh and Avni Chaturvedi are the three brave women fighters who are now undergoing training in Sukhoi-30.
A few days ago, the Honble President began a new chapter.
A group of women who have done extraordinary work for the first time in their respective fields met the President of India.
Our women power has done extraordinary work to break the traditional traditions of the society and established a new record.
They demonstrated that hard work, hard work and determination, however hurdles and obstacles were created, they could cross them and create a new path by crossing them.
Now this path inspires not only our contemporary people but also generations to come.
The book is available in the form of "Narendra Modi Website" Varsudhadha e-book.
Today, women power of this country has played a very important role in the positive transformation in the country and the society.
Today, when we talk about women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station here.
Now we must have thought about the relationship between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Matunga Railway Station in Mumbai which has all the women staff.
The station has women employees in all the departments.
After seeing the portal of the Republic Day, many people wrote on Twitter and on other social media that all women had participated in the CBSE Biker Continent.
These women were adventurously experimenting and they also surprised the guests from abroad.
Both words empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today, our women are leading.
They are becoming self-reliant.
But our tribal women and women of Chhattisgarh have produced a new picture before the country.
The area of Dantewada district in Chhattisgarh is under Maoist influence.
On the strength of violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols, the Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere here.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such a critical area by running e-rickshaws.
The introduction of any social life, the changes made by it by itself, the techniques of reforming it are being developed.
Continuous efforts are being made at the individual and social level in our country against social evils and evils and practices.
Just a few days back, a good effort was made in Bihar.
It was the world's longest human chain, which was built over 13,000 kilometres in the state to eliminate social evils.
In this campaign, people created awareness among the society against evil practices like child marriage, hoonda etc.
The entire state has resolved to fight against the evils of Hunda and child marriage.
Young people, mothers and sisters participated in this campaign.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patan, this human chain was unbreakablely linked to the border of the state.
Our society should be free from such evils so that all the people of the society need to be benefited in the true sense of development.
Then let us collectively take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration of the state and every person involved in the human chain.
However, after getting information about Janaushadhi Kendras, they started buying medicines from there and now their father's medicines have been reduced by 75.
It helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday.
Generic medicines are similar to the standards set by the World Health Organisation.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable rates.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This will not only provide cheaper medicines but will also create new employment opportunities for the individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana and at Amrit Stores of the patients.
The only aim of these schemes is to provide affordable and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country and to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh has sent a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App from Maharashtra.
My thoughts are with him because of the separation of this photo.
In this photo, a grandson along with his friends participated in the Clean Morana River Cleanliness campaign.
I was told that the people of Akola have started a programme to clean the 'Morna River' in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
One more difficult thing is that wild grass and waterfalls had flown in the river bowl.
Waste waste was also being dumped on the river and its banks.
The villagers prepared an action plan and on 13th January, before the Makar Sankranti, Swachh Morna Mohim was constructed, accordingly, in the first phase, cleaning of both the streams of Morana river at four kilometres in the area of four kilometres.
I am told that the Akolekar campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the river Morana is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then something is impossible.
It can bring about a transformation through mass movement.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of discussion about the Padma awards.
Every year there is a tradition of awarding the Padma Awards but for the last three years the entire process of the award has been changed.
Now any citizen can give a name for the award.
This entire process has become transparent due to online process.
Now the importance of the work done by that person is being taken into consideration and it is being introduced to give the awards.
You must have heard that you would be happy to know the work done by Arvind Gupta ji.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has saved his life for making sports for young children.
They have been making constant efforts so that children can use scientific experiments from waste materials and pesticides.
For this, he went to three thousand schools across the country and showcased the paintings made in 18 different languages and inspired children.
This is the story of Sitava Jodatti of Karnataka.
They are not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the past three decades, Sitawa has played a major role in transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
He had dedicated himself as Devdasi at the age of seven, but Sitava spent his entire life for the welfare of the goddesses.
Not only this, he has also done a great job for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam from Madhya Pradesh, Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor, tribal family.
He used to do a simple job but he used to do traditional tribal paintings and paintings.
It is because of this verse that he has received respect not only in India but in the entire world.
The exhibition showcases their paintings in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He has been awarded Padma Shri by recognizing the talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who has naming India abroad.
They have built more than five hundred herbs based on their memories.
He has been honoured with the Padma Shri Award for his outstanding social work in the field of exploration and exploration of outstanding persons.
Today, I would like to mention another name here and the 75-year-old Subashni Mistri of West Bengal has also been selected for the Padma Awards.
Subhasini Mistri, the lady dumped utensils and sold vegetables in the houses of others for the construction of the hospital.
This life-threatening crisis inspired them to build hospitals for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospitals created by their hard work.
I would like to tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who work for the society around us, who live for the society, who dedicate their lives to the society, who have worked with some special goal or some other, who have worked for their lives and sometimes they should be brought to the society.
Such people dont work at all for dignity.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year on 9th January.
Revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa on 9th January.
On this day, we are celebrating the festival of unbreakable bonds between Indians living in India and around the world.
You will be pleased to know that the Mayor, Members of Parliament and Lok Delegates from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and USA and many other countries have participated in the event.
I would like to thank the European Union for doing a remarkable job, making the identity of the people of the original Indian origin and giving this information to the people of the entire world through a guideline.
Those who showed us a new path, the death anniversary of revered Bapu Ji is on 30th January.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, be it India or Duniya, the individual or the family or the society.
Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat is the last ever programme in this year and Yoga is the last day of the year 2017.
Throughout the year, we talked about a lot of things and shared a lot of things.
The innumerable letters and reactions you have received for Mann Ki Baat, the exchange of thoughts, all these would always give me new energy.
Now this year is going to change in a few hours but we will continue to talk about this thing, we will continue to talk about it.
In the coming year too, we will discuss new topics and share new experiences.
Many congratulations to all of you for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on 25th December, the Christmas Festival was celebrated all over the world with great enthusiasm.
We also see the essence of the spirit of service in the Bible.
The Sun of Man Haj Cum, Not to B Serveh, But to Serveh, And to Give Hij Life, Age Blessingto All Humankind.
In these bends, what is the importance of service, what is the importance of service
Whether it is going on in this world or be it religion or tradition or be it alphabet, the invaluable form of humanity is reflected in service.
In our country, we talk about Nishkam Karma, Nishkam Karma, Nishkam Karma, Nishkam Karma, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Karma, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Karma, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Karma, Nishkam, Nishkam, Karma, Nishkam, Nishkam, Nishkam, Karma, Nishkam, Karma, Nishkam, Karma, Nishkam, Nishkam, Karma, Nishkam, Karma, Karma,
We are also called Seva Parmo Dharma.
Life-service is Shiva-Seva and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans has said: Self-service should be done with emotion.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji's bravery and a unique life full of sacrifice are an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and he lived on the basis of those principles.
Guru Gobind Singh ji inspired people from all such roles as a guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior.
He fought against tyranny and injustice.
He taught people to brave the bonds of caste and religion.
In all these endeavours, they took a lot of steps at the individual level.
But he never slapped the spirit of malice in his mind.
Every moment in his life he continued to convey the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
This shows how great and special his personality was.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to participate in the Prakash Utsav programme organised in Patna Sahib on the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
One January, 2018.
You will also be surprised to know that the New Year will come and January will also come every year.
But when I say - 'specific' then that thing is really special.
And I urge all of you to register your names as voters.
The entire country is keen to welcome itself as a voter in the 21st century.
As a voter in the 21st century, you too must have felt a sense of pride.
Our opinion is the basis of New India.
The power of vote in democracy is the biggest strength.
Vote is the most effective tool for bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions.
We dont have the right to vote only.
So, what kind of India should we have in the 21st century, what kind of dreams should we have in the 21st century India
You will also be able to become the builder of the 21st century India and it will start from January 1.
I am confident that the dream of 'New India' will be realised with the strength of this vibrant youth.
When we talk about New India, it should be free from toxicities like casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
He should be free from uncleanness and poverty.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India should be our guiding force.
The youngsters of New India should come forward and deliberate on how New India should be.
They should also set a path for us which will be linked to it and it will become such a large group of people.
We should keep moving ahead and the country will also move forward.
When I was just talking to you, I got an idea in my mind that can we organise a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Can the youth of the age group of 18-25 years come together to deliberate on the issue of 'New India' and find ways to make them youngsters
How can we realise our resolve before 2022
What can we do to build the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
My young friends, today the need of the hour is that we too should create a mass movement for a grand and divine India in the 21st century.
Today, innumerable new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youngsters are coming forward and succeeding.
I believe that we should create an independent and robust system so that the youngsters of New India can get information about these schemes in one place.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had told you about the importance of "political".
Positiveness and zeal are possible for those individuals.
In English, it is said that in the previous episode Mann Ki Baat, I had requested the countrymen to share the positive moments that you experienced during the year 2017 and welcome them in the same positive atmosphere.
People gave a very positive response on social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Some people have made special strides in their individual lives.

My name is Satish Bevani.
Our area had a very serious problem of water and forty years we were dependent on the waterways of Armi.
Now there is a free movement for us.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy that comes from such small things, let us take decisive steps to move from a positive India to a progressive India in the beginning of New Year.
Now all of us are discussing positively, so I am also eager to share one thing here.
I am very enthusiastic about the recent achievements of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, who has been ranked top in the administrative service exam in Kashmir.
Terrorism and malicious atrocities have emerged out of this environment and have been ranked first in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He wrote the story of success with his own hands.
Today, Anjum has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjumana has proved that however evil the situation may be, the scum of disappointment can be ruined through positive work.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet some Kanakas of Jammu and Kashmir in the last week.
I used to familiarize with the dreams of the will power and the enthusiasm that was there in them.
They used to say that in what field they want to progress in their lives, they used to live up to their expectations.
I used to feel that there is no disappointment in them.
He had enthusiasm, joy, energy, great dreams and resolutions.
I was inspired by the time I spent with these Kashmiri daughters.
This is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about the temple of Sabarimala in Kerala when it was discussed not only in our country but also in the famous religious places of the world.
Millions of devotees come every year to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world famous temple.
P.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every pilgrim believes in the worship of God and does something or the other clean.
Now, no matter how big a celebrity is, no matter how rich a person is, no matter how big a person is, everybody is joining this programme like a common traveler.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
At the same time, along with strict vigilance, the resolution of cleanliness is also taken.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, all of us have made a solemn pledge to make a Swachh Bharat, a Clean India, a Clean India, a Clean India.
Efforts are being made on a massive scale across the country towards cleanliness.
Peoples participation in rural as well as urban areas is also showing changes.
The Swachh Survekshan-2018, the largest in the world, is scheduled to be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the extent of sanitation levels in the urban areas and the extent to which the Swachhta Mission is achieving success.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4000 cities and about 40 crore population of the country.
Whether it is an open defecation free in cities, or not, whether it is a waste collection system or not, whether it is a scientific waste management or not, whether it is an effort to change the habits of the people, whether it is an effort to create capacities or to use some innovations for sanitation
During the survey, various teams will be examining the cities.
They will interact with the citizens and understand their responses.
The Swachhta App will be used and analyzed for improvement in different types of services.
Its not at all that the government alone is engaged in maintaining cleanliness.
It is also a big responsibility for the cleanliness of every citizen and civil society organizations.
And I urge every citizen to join the Swachh Survekshan in large numbers.
And you should make a solemn pledge that you should not ask for cleanliness in the city.
I am sure you must have felt the habit of classifying dry waste and wet waste and you will be using different waste hats like blue and green wastes while waste.
The principles of Reduce, Reuse and Recycling are very effective for waste.
Clean cities will be ranked on the basis of this survey and if the population of our city is more than one lakh, then it should be our dream that if there are less than one lakh population in the country then it should be the highest in the regional rankings.
And we should try the same thing.
And all of us should have a dream of 'Our City-Our Efforts', 'Our Progress and Country'.
Let us resolve to once again recall the revered Bapu and fulfil the resolution of a Clean India.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that are very small to see but if we look at them as a society then we become familiar.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
I was told that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Hajj, she cannot go to Mehram or Palakavina alone.
In particular, the rules and regulations do not exist in Islamic countries.
But in India, only Muslim women did not get this right.
And I am very happy to mention here that our government has taken care of this thing.
I have full faith and I firmly believe that the journey of India's development will continue to progress on the strength of our women power, on the confidence of their talent.
And that is why we should constantly strive to ensure that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women. And there is a need to move forward on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This year, 26th January, 2018 will be remembered in a special way.
This year, leaders of all ten ASEAN countries will be visiting India as Chief Guests at the Republic Day Celebrations.
This year, on Republic Day, there will be not one but ten chief guests.
2017 has been specialised in both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to join these great leaders of 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, our country is a country of festivals and festivals in a way.
Perhaps it will not be a day when no festival is celebrated on that day.
May the coming year bring great joy, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us move ahead with new zeal, new zeal, new joy and new resolve.
The festival of Makar Sankranti is being celebrated in the month of January, which is associated with nature.
In Rajasthan, Sankranti is called Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu and all these festivals have a special significance.
All these festivals are usually celebrated on 13th January, 2017.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now we will repeat this thing in 2018.
Indians will not be able to discover that there is no respect for them.
They are bigger than all of us at that age and are witnesses to various phases of the country.
I had the privilege of interacting with Didin on telephone before my departure for a foreign tour.
It was a lovely conversation between us in such a way that we should speak to our elder sister in a small way.
I am not truly speaking very much about this kind of personal conversation.
Listen, even on this turn of life, Latadi is eager to do everything related to the country.
The feeling of satisfaction in his life is associated with India's progress, with changing India and with India that has scaled new heights of progress.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I used to travel by plane.
Lata ji: Good, good.
What should be celebrated on the Great Day
And the accomplishment that we have achieved has been achieved through the medium of meditation and penance.
I don't really have anything.
Lata ji: Ho
Your letters are also available to me and I also keep getting the gifts you have sent me.
I dont want to give you a lot of trouble, because I see, I know how much work you are doing and how much work you have to think about.
Modi ji: My mother is very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: but I will soon join you.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for several weeks.
Our homes will be filled with joy.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of the joy of these festivals.
It is said that darkness is below the light.
Most of these words are not just a few words but a mandate, a philosophy and an inspiration for us.
Whenever sweets, clothes and gifts come in our houses, we should go out for a moment.
Even if we dont use the things that are more than required in our homes, we should certainly do the job of giving them out to the needy.
In many cities, many such institutions work with the start-ups of young friends.
They collect clothes, cereals, food and other essential items from the households of the people and discover the needs and deliver them to them.
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double our joy of the festival, it will shine on our faces, it will illuminate our lamps and it will illuminate our Diwali.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi is welcomed in the traditional form of laxmi in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Diwali.
Can we welcome Laxmi in a new way this year
In our culture, daughters have been considered as Lakshmi because daughters bring good fortune and prosperity.
Can we organize programmes for the honour of girls in our societies, villages and cities this year
Can we do this programme in the honor of these Laxmis of India on Diwali this year
There will be a lot of girls around you, many listeners who are doing extraordinary work.
Whether it is the work of educating the poor children, or the work of spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, whether it is a doctor or an engineer who is serving the society or a lawyer who is trying to provide justice to someone.
Our society should recognize such people, honour them and take pride in them.
This honour should be organised across the country.
One more thing can be done.
Share more information about the success of these girls through social media and use Bharat Ki Laxmi.
We had organised the Selfie with Daughter Movement and spread it across the globe. Similarly, we should also launch the mission of 'India Ki Laxmi' at this time.
Promoting India's Lakshmi initiative means empowering the path of prosperity for the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had just said that Mann Ki Baat programme has a huge advantage that I have the privilege of directly or indirectly interacting with several familiar and outstanding persons.
A few days ago, Alina Tayang, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, has sent me a leaflet and she has written in it.
I live in Roing in Arunachal Pradesh .
This year when the results of my examination were started, some people asked me if you read the book Exam Warriors.
I told them that I have not read this book.
But again I bought this book and read it two-three times.
My experience after that was very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before, I would have had a lot of benefits.
I believe that if you think about the new version of this book then you must include some more mantras for parents and teachers and some other labourers.
Thank you for reading the book Exam Warriors twice or thrice. Thank you very much for telling me what are the shortcomings in it.
This small friend of mine has entrusted me with one thing and has instructed me to do something.
I will certainly follow our orders.
You have said that when a new version of this book comes, I will definitely try to write something for the parents and teachers in it.
But I would urge you all to help me in this thing.
What are your experiences in everyday life
I once again express my gratitude to our young friend and student Alina Tayang of Arunachal Pradesh.
My dear countrymen, through newspapers and television, you are getting information about the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India.
But you are aware that I am a common man like you, a common man and therefore, the impact of things that can be seen on an ordinary life is the same on my mind as I am amongst you.
Then I also heard that speech and also saw a fight.
Just a short while ago, he was defeated by the Grand Slam winner and Emperor Rafael Nadal of the tennis world.
The audience present there enthusiastically welcomed their speeches.
He also appreciated the Donald Livelihoods Act, which has inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis.
Even after being defeated in the face of adversity, he praised his competitors and set an example of sportspersonship in front of the world.
At the same time, on the other hand, winner Nadal also appreciated Danish sports.
There is a lot that every class and person of every age can learn.
These are moments that are beyond winning or defeat, when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The thoughts of our ancestors were really commendable.
Vidya Vinay Upadhata Hartin Nancesi Kasya Manujya: Janjati Loksya Lochan Andam means that when a person has simultaneous qualifications and humility, then who cannot get a better mind
In fact, these young sportspersons have won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say now is really going to tell you for your good.
There will be debates, there will always be differences between the parties but if some things are stopped before they are spreading at a rapid pace then it will be of great benefit.
The things that are growing at a rapid pace and spreading at a rapid pace become difficult after stopping them.
But in the beginning, if we stop awakening then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, today I feel like talking to my beloved youngsters.
You all are aware that tobacco consumption is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit intoxication.
The quantity of intoxication is more in it because of nicotine present in tobacco .
Its consumption in adolescence has an adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I want to talk about a new topic with you.
You must be aware of the fact that restrictions on e-cigarettes have been imposed in India recently.
E cigarette is a different electronic appliance than a regular cigarette .
In cigarette because of heat of nicotine rich fluid a kind of chemical smoke is produced , through which nicotine is consumed .
We may be aware of the dangers of cigarettes often, but there is a misunderstanding about e-cigarettes that no danger is caused due to e-cigarettes.
Aromatic chemicals are used in it so that it does not spread its stink like other cigarettes .
We have seen around us that in many households there are chensmokers but they prevent others from smoking at home.
E-cigarettes are different.
If someone smokes around us then he knows it from his habitat.
Even if there is a cigarette packet in someone's pocket, it can only be understood from the pocket.
However, it is not like this that many adolescents and youngsters can be seen roaming around with e-cigarettes in their books, in their pockets and in their pockets sometimes with pride and fashion statements.
Young generation is the future of the country.
The cigarettes have been banned so that these types of intoxication do not prove to be ruining our youth.
These restrictions have been imposed so that the dreams of the family can not be neglected, the lives of children should not be neglected, the habit of addiction should not spread to the society.
I urge you all to abandon this intoxication of tobacco and do not keep any irregularity regarding E-CC.
Let us together build a healthy India.
Hey, do you remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that we should go to the gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
For Fit India, we have to stay away from all these addictions.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is indeed a privilege for us that our India has been the birthplace and workplace of many exceptional people who have spent their lives for the welfare of others.
India is the birthplace of many exceptional people, it is the land of karmabhoomi and these are the people who have laid down their lives not only for themselves but also for the welfare of others.
One such great person will be honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of great pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will declare Mary Thresia as a saint on 13th October.
The work that Mr. Mary Thresia has done for the welfare of humanity in her childhood of fifty years is a unique example for the entire world.
He was extremely interested in social service and education.
He built several schools, accommodations and orphanages.
He established the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family, which is still fulfilling his lifestyles and missions.
Once again I pay my homage to Mr. Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not for the whole of India but for the world that while we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have pledged to be free from single use plastic.
Seeing the leadership that India has played in the direction of environmental protection, the vision of the countries of the world today has been rolled out to India.
I am confident that all of you will participate in the Single Youth Plastic Free Movement on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this mission in their own way. However, a youth of our country has started running a mission in a unique way.
When I noticed his work, I talked to him on telephone and tried to understand his new experiments.
Perhaps the interaction with him will be useful for some other people of the country.
Shri Ripudaman Belgiji is making a unique effort.
When I first heard the word 'plogging', it was also new to me.
You have been running this programme in an innovative manner and specially, in a way that the youth will like.
I congratulate you all from the bottom of my heart.
Friends, The Sports Ministry is also organizing Fit India Plogging Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of respected Bapu this year.
Two kilometers of plugging on October 2.
This programme will be organized across the country.
We have heard from the experiences of the people about how to do this programme, what to do in the programme.
Through this campaign, awareness of cleanliness is also increasing along with public awareness about health.
I am confident that 130 crore Indians will take a step towards liberating single use plastic and India will take 130 crore steps together.
Rupudman ji, once again thank you very much.
My best wishes to you, to your team and to your innovation.
I would like to tell you a little bit about one thing.
However, I would like to tell you in detail about this thing in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I have been asking you to get the opportunity to prepare.
You must be aware that on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is being celebrated.
So we have to start preparations for that.
I will talk about it in detail but it is still time.
Some people can start the exercise and some other schemes can be formulated.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022 we should visit fifteen places in India.
Programme at least fifteen places and one or two nights.
Let us see, understand and experience India.
We have so many diversities.
And when people come on holidays on the occasion of Diwali then they definitely go to tour. Therefore, I once again urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the World Tourism Day was celebrated on 27th September and some of the responsibilities of the world present the tourism scenario and that India has improved its place in the tourism competitive index.
And all this has been possible because of your cooperation, especially because of understanding the importance of tourism.
If we do more, we will certainly be able to get top of the world's main tourist destinations when we complete 75 years of our independence.
Enjoy and excitement as well.
Our festivals are celebrated and celebrated together, and this collective endeavour also brings a new strength to collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
Vijay Karnataka Newspaper of Times Group launched a series of initiatives in which he urged the children to send a letter to the Prime Minister.
He has also written that if he gives more information about nature to children, it will be useful in the future for protecting the environment.
A girl named Rida Nadaf from Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of a soldier in the army and she feels proud of it.
Which Indian would not feel proud of the army's army
And you are the daughter of that soldier, it is natural for you to feel proud.
Irfana Begum from Kalaburagi has said that her school is 5 kilometres away from her village, so she has to leave home early and she is also late to return home.
Therefore, they cannot play much with their friends and they should have schools near their homes.
My dear countrymen, a newspaper has initiated this kind of initiative and that is why I got the opportunity to save these letters.
It was a wonderful experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 1949, the Constituent Assembly had accepted the event of India today.
The Constitution came into force on 26th January, 1950 and therefore we celebrate 26th January as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to create the Constitution.
No field of life, no subject of nature has changed into it.
Equality and sensitivity to all are the hallmarks of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the letter of our Constitution.
Every citizen or administrator should behave in accordance with the Constitution.
This is the message of the Rajya Sabha that no one should be harmed.
The Dasuda Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He played a very big role.
He asserted that the welfare of every section of the society will be ensured.
On 6th December, we remember and salute him on his Mahaparinirvana.
Baba Saheb has contributed immensely to empowering and prospering the country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on his death anniversary on 15th December.
Sardar Patel, the son of a farmer to an iron male, has also done an extraordinary job of binding the country together.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Consultative Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
But the country cannot forget that even nine years ago, on 2611 today, there was a terrorist attack in Mumbai.
Today, I remember and salute the brave civilians, police and security personnel who lost their lives.
The country will never forget their sacrifices.
It has become ready to wipe out human power.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi have given the world the message of non-violence and love.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to eradicate and weaken our social structure.
And that is why the need of the hour is to be more conscious of the humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Navy Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy protects our maritime shores.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our cultures have developed in the coastal areas of the rivers.
Be it the Indus river or the river Ganga or the Yamuna or the river Sarvati, our rivers and seas are both economic and strategic.
These are the gateways for the entire world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable bond with the oceans.
When we look at history, 800-900 years ago, the navy of the king was counted among the most capable ships during the Mars dynasty.
In the expansion of the Maurya empire, the empire was part of his navy to rename the empire as an economic super power at that time.
Several examples of the Marathi naval missions and research journeys are still available in Sangam literature.
Most of the navies around the world have been allowed to join women in the long run.
But in the Marathi Navy, and that too 800-900 years ago, women had performed very well.
The women were also involved in the war.
The Marshals had the latest knowledge of shipbuilding.
How can we forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his navy when the Navy is mentioned
The terrain of Konkan situated on the sea level was incorporated into the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj .
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Swarnadurga associated with Shivaji Maharaj were either in the coastal areas or in the sea.
The Marathas navy was protecting these forts.
Large and small boats were included in the Marathas Armaan.
Their naval personnel were capable of attacking and defending any enemy.
It is impossible to discuss Maratha Armaan and not mention Kanhoji Angre.
He gave a new grandeur to the Marathas Armaan, and set up a base of Maratha soldiers at many places.
The Indian Navy has gained valour several times even after independence.
Whether it is the liberation war of Goa or the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971.
INS Sumitra, the naval ship assisted in quick rescue and evacuated many fishermen safely to Bangladesh.
In May-June this year, when a large flood broke out in Sri Lanka, three boats of our navy reached there immediately and they helped the government and the people there.
The naval ship, INS Kadiyal of our Navy, had humanitarian assistance in relation to Rohingya in Bangladesh.
In June, the Papua New Guinea Government gave us the SOS message and assisted our navy to save the fishermen on their fishing boats.
During a merchant shipwreck in the West Gulf on 21 Nov 19, the INS Trikand of our navy rushed to the warship.
The Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special drive from 1st to 7th December this year to express pride and respect for the security forces of the country.
Throughout the week, small children, big guys, everyone put the flag on the national flag.
There should be a movement across the country to pay homage to the soldiers.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
Anyone in your familiarity with the armed forces can post their experiences, their bravery, their paintings and photographs related to them in armedforcesflagday.
Invite people from the armed forces in schools and colleges to learn more about the army's work.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to know more about the army.
This is also an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our Defence Forces.
The fund is being utilized by the Sainik Welfare Board for the welfare of the families of martyrs and the wounded soldiers and for their rehabilitation.
Let us also contribute to the morale of our Armed Forces on this occasion.
Let us also join hands for their welfare.
My dear countrymen, 5th December is World Soil Day.
I want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters too.
Soil is an important element of the Earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Imagine what would happen if there was no nutritious soil in the world
How are the living standards
And that is why we have been conscious of the importance of soil since time immemorial.
In our culture, on the one hand, there was a sense of devotion and respect towards agriculture in the minds of the people. And on the other hand, soil was nurtured due to the use of many scientific methods.
Two aspects of the life of the farmers of this country are of utmost importance. We will take care of them from our soil and from our scientific point of view.
We are proud that the farmers of our country are connected with traditions and are also conscious of modern sciences and use them in agriculture.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj block and the farmers of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers used chemical fertilizers in a imbalanced manner and the soil quality was lower.
Production was declining, thereby reducing the income of the farmers and reducing the soil productivity.
Some of the awakened farmers of the village have discovered the seriousness of the situation and thereafter the farmers of the village have examined their soil, they have acknowledged the amount of fertilizers, nutritious elements and organic fertilizers that they have been advised to use.
You will be surprised to know that the information provided to the farmers through Soil Health Cards, the guidance provided to the farmers has a positive effect.
In 2016-17, the production of wheat has increased by three to four times and the income has also increased by one to four thousand rupees.
If we take care of the crops then we should take care of the soil and if we take care of the mother dam then it will also take care of us.
More than 10 crore farmers across the country have prepared Soil Health Cards so that they can get better information about their soil and sow their crops.
We devote ourselves to Mother Dam, however, did we think that fertilizer like urea is very dangerous for the health of the dam mother
It has been proved by many scientific experiments that more than necessary urea causes damage to the ground.
The farmer is the son of this dam mother and how will he make her mother sick
It is the need of the hour to revive this relationship between mother and son.
Can our farmers make a solemn pledge to eradicate the use of urea for our agriculture by 2022, when it will be 75 years of our independence
Once the sons and daughters of Dami Maa made a solemn pledge that the health of the land will improve at a rapid pace and there will be an increase in production.
Transforming the lives of the farmers in true sense.
We have started experiencing the global temperature rise and climate change.
There was a time when winters started before Diwali.
Now it has come to a standstill in December and it is getting cold.
It is our experience that we dont feel like getting out of the breeze.
However, in such a situation, the people of awareness work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
But determination and determination were greater and stronger.
The eight-year-old son could not speak, but he took the support of the rock.
At 5 a.m. this son used to go to the village house and ask him not to defecate in the open.
This Poori village became Open Defecation Free due to the efforts of this child who taught cleanliness in at least 30-40 households everyday.
Every moment we get to learn something new.
Today, they are performing well in every field.
Be it sports, competitions or social initiatives, our Divyangjans are not lagging behind in any case.
You all might remember that in the Rio Olympics, our Divyangjans had won 4 medals in the best sports and they also won the World Cup of the Blind T-twenty cricket.
There are several types of competitions going on across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Water Contest was held in Udaipur.
In 80 of his body there are no muscles, but look at his courage, determination and hard work.
He also won a Gold in the 70th National Para Watershed Competition, which led to his selection by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralympics.
He will be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gujarat.
I salute and convey my best wishes to young Jigar Thakkar.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens and I hope that this festival of Eid will inspire you all to enhance peace and harmony in the society and will give you new energy, new energy and new resolutions.
(Phone call) Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am talking to Neeraj Singh from Kanpur.
I would like to urge you to once again tell us the best of the 10 things that you have talked about in a year through Mann Ki Baat so that we can recall those things and learn more from them.
We have made very good suggestions.
After listening to your speech, I want to put more emphasis on it, I want to change it.
The old-age minds in our villages always say, forget the grief and do not forget the happiness.
I invite you all to welcome the year 2018 in a happy atmosphere, with auspicious memories and with positive thoughts.
Come, share positive things with Positive India (Hashtag Positive India) on the Narendra Modi App, MyGov or social media.
Give light to others who are inspiring.
We all see the strength of these collective efforts and its impact together.
I am sure that in the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat, I will try to reach out to the people of the country the experiences that have come up on the Positive India Hashtag Positive India.
My dear countrymen, I will once again interact with you for Mann Ki Baat next month.
There will be a lot of opportunity to talk about.
Many thanks
Six days after Deepawali, the Chhath festival is one of the most loyal festivals of our country.
In which traditional rules from food to dresses are followed.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is completely associated with the worship of nature and nature.
Sun and water, these great festivals are at the centre of sixth rituals, while bamboo and earthen utensils and earthen pots are useful materials for this worship.
Dunia worships Ugat, but in Chhathupuj, she also gives us the value of worshiping those things which are certain.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also included in this festival.
Cleanliness of the entire house before Chhathpuja, along with the cleanliness of the rivers, ponds, shores and puja ghats, all the people are very excited.
Suryavandana or Chhathpuja is a festival of migration protection, prevention and discipline.
Normally, we can imagine the lack of food and the inferiority complex.
But in Chhathupuj, after half of the morning, after eating prasad, this is a special tradition.
This is the reason that the ego gets destroyed and the ego is such a feeling that it hinders the progress of the person.
It is very natural for the people to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am convinced that Mann Ki Baat has been linked to 100 per cent monitoring.
Take Khadi and Handloom examples.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I always urge you for handloom, Khadi and you will be happy to know what is the result.
I was told that on the 17th of October this month, on the day of Dhantriyadashi, a record sale of Rs. 1 crore 20 lakhs was registered at Khadi Village Industries Building Store in Delhi.
You might be happy to know that Khadi and Handloom are being sold at such a large scale in the same store.
During Deepawali, the sales in Khadi's Gift Kupan have grown by nearly 680.
The sales of Khadi and Handicrafts and Handicrafts also showed an increase of about 90 percent this year as compared to the previous year.
Today, the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every age group like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how much weavers, poor families and families working on handlooms would have benefitted from this business.
However, from the experience of the past few years, I can say that Khadi has replaced Khadi for Transformation after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion.
Khadi has become a tool for the poorest of the poor by transforming the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role for the village industry.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experiences of Diwali with my security forces and he wants to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shri Tejas Gaikwad has also asked the Narendra Modi App whether there can be arrangements for the sweetened security forces of our country.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweetness of our house should reach the soldiers of the country.
Deepawali must have been celebrated with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali also brought a special experience for me.
I respect every soldier of the security forces along with all the citizens of the country for their struggle, dedication and sacrifice.
When we get time, we will have to understand the experiences of the soldiers and we will have to adhere to their pride.
Many of you are unaware that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but are also playing an important role in world peace.
Everyone is aware of the United Nations efforts to establish peace across the world and their positive landscape.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means that the world is my family.
With this belief, India has been active in various UN initiatives from the very beginning.
You all are well aware of the fact that India's proposal for deciding and UN Charter's proposal began with the words "Woe the Pipal".
India has always emphasized on womens equality and UN declaration on human rights is a living example of that.
In his Initial Frame, the Proposal was replaced by All Main R. Borne Free and Equal, with the efforts of Indian representative Hansa Mehta and later accepted the All-Human Beings R Borne Free and Equal.
If you look at it then it is a small change, but a powerful thought is seen in it.
Indias role in UN Peacekeeping Operations is the key contributors made by India through UN embraille.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping operations.
Presently, seven thousand soldiers have been added to UN Peacekeeping and is the third highest in the world.
By August, 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping.
This peace effort took place in some countries like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, 20,000 patients were treated in the Indian Army Hospital and saved countless people.
Indian security forces have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won the hearts of those people.
Indian women too have played an important role in peace-building.
India is the only country that very few people are aware of the fact that India will send women police units to Library in the Shanti-Abhiyan Mission.
And this step of India will inspire the nations of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
We will be proud to know that India is playing its role not only in peacekeeping operations but also in 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peace Campaign, this is not an easy task.
Our security guards have to work in remote areas.
Their memory blossoms with pride.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji made a special recognition in Cyprus.
In 1989, he was appointed as a Force Commander for Operations in Namibia, the 72nd year and he served him to ensure the independence of that country.
General Thimayya, who was the Chief of the Army Staff, also led the UN Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus and embraced the peace process.
As a peace ambassador, India always gave a message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everyone should move ahead with the vision of a peaceful, harmonious life and a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our lands are decorated with such great personalities who have served humanity without any hesitation.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Sister Nivedita, is also one of these unusual people.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ireland as Nobel but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
Pendit means dedicated in full form
Later, he proved himself by doing something in accordance with the name.
Yesterday marked the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
Swami Vivekananda's cars were so impressed that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was deeply distressed by the atrocities in the British Raj.
Not only did the British make our country a rosary, but they also tried to make our mindset a rosary.
Our culture has always been inferior to our inferiority complex.
Sister Nivedita ji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He wanted people to unite by awakening the national consciousness.
He went to various countries across the globe and raised his voice against the anti-democratic practices of contemporary religion and philosophy.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati, our revolutionary poems are known for Pudumarai Penn, New Woman and women empowerment.
It was believed that their inspiration was sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita ji also assisted great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Through our writings and conferences, we have helped in research and dissemination.
It is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are the best examples of this.
In 1899, Bhisan Plague took place in Kolkata and hundreds of people lost their lives.
Sister Nivedita did not take care of her health and started the work on road sanitation.
She was such a woman who could lead a comfortable life but she was associated with the service of the poor.
People took inspiration from them and helped them in service.
He taught the people about cleanliness and service in their cars.
On his grave, he wrote, "Hear Repositions Sister Nivedita Hu Gave Har All to India" - Sister Nivedita is relaxing here, who gave her all to India.
Undoubtedly, they did this.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of my first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
These are the heroes of building a New India.
Our anxiety is correct when the diseases are older and they are now seen in small kids as well as in the last stage of their life.
There were exceptional diseases in the youth too.
However, now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are now known as lifestyle disorders .
Diseases such as low physical activity and changes in food habits may occur in young age.
It is essential that the society and the families should pay attention to this thing.
When we think about it, we will realise that there is no need to do anything swiftly.
There is only a need to change our habits by regularizing the best practices and by changing our habits.
Instead of going to Lifton, you should adopt the habit of climbing the jinna.
After dinner, the entire family should try to move with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This yoga, especially our young friends, will be able to assimilate a lifestyle and protect them from lifestyle disorders.
The unique feature of Yoga for 30 minutes before school is that Yoga is easy and universal.
And I would like to say that Yoga can easily be done by a person of any age group.
One can easily learn simple methods and one can do anything for all that is possible.
There is no need for special resources or ground for this.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there has been good news in the field of sports in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have brought laurels for the country in various fields.
India won the Asia Cup hockey trophy in Hockey.
Our sportspersons performed the best and on this strength India became the Asia Cup Champion after 10 years.
Earlier, India had become the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2007.
I convey my best wishes to these hockey teams and all the teams from across the country.
After Hockey, there is a news report in Badminton too.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth won the Denmark Open Trophy and gave a fillip to the nations pride.
This is his third Super Series Premiere Award after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, FIFA Under Saventin World Cup was organized this month.
Many confederations from across the globe came to India and showcased their skills on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to see a confrontation.
Sportspersons were enthusiastic.
This big event of World Cup, the whole world was watching us.
I was enchanted to see such a huge battle and the energy, enthusiasm and zeal of young sportspersons.
The World Cup was successful and all the teams exhibited the best.
Even though India did not get a tear, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of everyone.
All the world including India enjoyed the sports festival and this entire competition became thrilling and entertaining for football lovers.
There are indications that the future of football is bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, I have to do the Mann Ki Baat programme everyday to bring justice to the feelings of the people who write to me on the subject of Swachh Bharat.
Some young children send photos of their efforts and some youngsters have a role in them.
If there is a story of new initiatives related to cleanliness, then there is a news of change in the situation due to the zeal of an officer.
A few days ago, I received a detailed report, which mentions the transformation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
On the other hand, a voluntary organization called the Ecosystem Protection Organization (EPO) carried out Swachhta Abhiyan at the Chandrapur Fort.
In this campaign that lasted for two hundred days, people did not stop or tired, they worked for the cleanliness of the fort.
I was enchanted to see the photos and somebody who saw this photo, who would have been disappointed with the surrounding uncleanness, would have realized that how the dream of cleanliness would be fulfilled.
It will change our disappointment into confidence.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
Guru Nanak Devji is not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also the Jagadguru.
He spoke of the well-being of the entire humanity, and addressed the gathering.
He emphasized on women empowerment and womens dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28,000 kilometers and during this journey, he taught the teachings of truth humanity.
He interacted with the people and showed the path of truth, sacrifice and devotion.
He gave the message of social equality and showed this lesson not only by speaking but by his own work.
He started an anchor which created a sense of service for the people.
A spirit of unity and equality emerged among the people by taking food together.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of meaningful life - Remember God, labour, work and help in times of need.
Guru Nanak Devji had created Gurbani to share his philosophy.
In the coming year 2019, we will celebrate the 55th Prakash Year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us strive to follow the path of his message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, two days later, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji.
We are aware that he had laid the foundation of a modern India.
We can learn a lot from this great saintly life of Mother India.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is that he not only gave transformative ideas but was also impatient in finding practical solutions from complex problems to achieve that.
He was a skilled expert in making the ideas come true.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had made India a hub.
It is ensured that crores of Indians can be brought under the umbrella of one nation and one Constitution.
His decision-making enabled him to overcome all odds.
He honoured them wherever they needed to be honoured.
They used force wherever there was a need to use force.
He set a goal and resolved with that goal.
Only he could do the work of keeping the country together.
He dreamt of a nation where all people would be equal.
I believe that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels ideas are always inspiring.
He had said, "No discrimination of caste can stop us, all are the daughters of India, we should love our country and make a future of mutual love and harmony.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and convergent for our Vision of a New India.
And his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I urge you all to participate in the Run for Unity - this festival of goodwill.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali holidays, with a new resolution and with a new resolve, all of you must have come to your daily lives.
Best wishes to my fellow countrymen for all their dreams.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat taxation through All India Radio.
Today it is 36th.
Most of them are inspiring for me.
There are a lot of things to improve the government.
There are also some personal grievances.
I take half an hour every month but people send their messages on Mann Ki Baat for 30 days.
As a result, the government has also been sensitive.
And that is why the journey of three years of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps in such a short span of time I have got the opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of the common man of the country.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba always used to say, "Government, non-Government".
I have kept this thing away from the political colour, I have tried to connect with myself with a stable mind instead of drifting it into the subject that has been pierced.
I am aware that after three years, social researchers, universities, researchers, intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I believe that this idea will be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat that we should not go out while eating. Therefore, we need to take as much food as we need.
After this I noticed that I received letters from every corner of the country in large numbers.
Several social organisations, many youngsters are already working on this thing.
I came to know that there are many people who have been working to bring together the food supplements that can be utilised.
Once I saw the story of a Sarpanch of Haryana Selfie with Daughter and I told them in Mann Ki Baat.
See, not only in India but also in the whole world, a big campaign of selfie with Daughter was launched.
This is not just the issue of social media.
This event made every daughter a new self-confidence, a new pride.
A few days ago, I was interacting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people visiting outside that wherever you go on the topic of Incredible India, you sent photographs of that place and millions of photographs came.
It has come from every nook and corner of India and in a way it is a great opportunity for the people working in the tourism sector.
I have experienced this thing because of Mann Ki Baat that how big a small event can create.
I was wondering that Mann Ki Baat had started for three years. During the last three years, several incidents touched my heart.
Every moment is being thought of going through the right direction of the country.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of the other, for the betterment of the society, for the progress of the country.
I have understood, understood and learnt from the countrymen in my three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
I salute the countrymen from the bottom of my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi was not a cloth but a thought.
Once again I would like to urge you all to continue the mission of Khadi.
If we buy Khadi then we should work with this feeling that the light of Deepawali will be illuminated in the houses of the poor.
This work will strengthen the poor people of our country and that is why we should do this thing.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase the productivity and how to handle solar energy
The idea is to revive the system which has been closed for 20-20, 25-25 and 30-30 years.
Now the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh was closed for 26 years but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been associated with it.
Several people were provided new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries have resumed their training centres in Pampore, Kashmir and there is a lot to contribute to this region.
Now with the resumption of this training centre, it will help in modernizing the new generation, weaving cloth and inclusion of new things.
People have also started giving Khadi goods while visiting each other.
Cleanliness will connect people.
Our honourable President started this work and the entire nation participated in it.
Whether it is the elderly, the men or women or the cities or the villages, everyone has become a part of this cleanliness drive.
When I say that Sankalp se Siddhi is now moving towards a solemn pledge.
Everyone accepts, cooperates and contributes something or the other to realize this movement.
I am grateful to the Honble President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has considered it as its work.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people have participated in more than 40 thousand programmes in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
One thing is that we have to do cleanliness somewhere and the other thing is that we dont do cleanliness by being aware but if we want to make cleanliness then there is a need for a ideological movement too.
The Swachhata Hi Seva campaign has been accompanied by several competitions.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the essay competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children took out pictures.
Using his imagination, he brought out pictures on the subject of cleanliness.
Several people wrote poetry and during these days, the pictures that I have sent by my child friends and young children are posted in social media.
Whenever it comes to cleanliness, I never forget to express my gratitude to the people of the media.
These people have carried forward this movement in a very good manner.
They are also leading this cleanliness movement in their own way.
In this Swachhata Hi Seva Movement, we can see the huge service of the country by electronic media and print media in our country.
Just a few days ago, some of my friends had taken note of the 18-year-old New Delhi Bill Dar.
No, there is nothing like that.
Bill Dar has been doing the cleanliness work for the past five-six years from the age of 12-13 years of his age.
The largest lake in Asia is near Srinagar, be it plastic, polyethylene, polythene or waste or waste or clean the lake after removing everything.
Bill Dar is younger than the age but it has become an inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that future history is born out of the womb of history and when it comes to history, it is very natural to remember the great men.
This month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, on October 11, the birth anniversary of Jayprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh, and on September 25, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was the central point of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left his political career and was engaged in the work of Gramodya. And when his centenary year is being celebrated today, it is very natural to have a sense of respect for his village work.
During the interaction with the youngsters, the former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji always talked about Nanaji Deshmukhs rural development.
He used to mention Nanaji's work with great respect and he himself went to the villages to see Nanaji's work.
Deendayal Upadhyay ji, like Mahatma Gandhi ji, spoke about the last man in the society.
Sardar Saheb had united the entire country.
We should also move ahead with the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We say with great ease, simple words: Unity in diversity - the characteristic of India.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to reiterate to my countrymen that especially to my younger generation, we are awakening.
Summer vacations are there, Diwali is there, we have to go out somewhere in our country.
People go out as tourists and it is very natural .
But sometimes I feel that our people are not able to see our country, they are not able to understand the diversity of the country.
You must go out of the country, I don't oppose it, but should you ever visit any place in your country
Looking at the lives of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam ji, one more thing is that when they visited India, they were able to see India and at that time they got a new inspiration to live for India and to sacrifice their lives for this country.
All these great men had travelled extensively to India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
The value addition in tourism will be such that when we do not just go to the top of a sportsperson, go to the top of a student and try to understand his life.
I have got the opportunity to stay in more than four and a half districts for the night. And today, when I take this responsibility in India, I am feeling a lot of benefits from the tourism that has taken place at that time.
It does not take time at all.
I urge all of you that in this vast India, there is not just a declaration of unity in diversity, it is a storehouse of our unconventional strength.
There are many types of food habits in our country .
There are so many types of foods that we will not get the first thing again.
Now, this is a big strength of our tourism.
I am sure that if you go out anywhere during this time too, you will carry forward my first mission.
You must send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
When I met the people there, I sent them photographs.
I have an idea in my mind that in order to promote tourism in India, what can be the best tourist destinations in our state, every Indian should know about those seven special places in our state.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can we provide some information about these places
Can we provide this information on the Narendra Modi App
Can we give this information on Hashtag Incredible India
Just imagine, if all the people in a state start getting to know about this thing then I will ask the government to communicate the information and prepare the publicity literature about the seven things that have come from every state.
This means, in a way, how can tourist destinations be encouraged by the people's intentions
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also become a major and important partner in promoting tourism in the country using the period from October to March.
I invite you for that.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
There is a rift in my mind.
Something goes wrong on my mind.
In the end, I am a human being like you.
The Indian Army has received two brave soldiers in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Fund.
Unusually, both Swati and Nidhi were martyred while serving Mother India.
You can imagine that if we lose wealth at such a young age then how will we have a mindset
However, Swati Mahadik, wife of Shaheed Karnal Santosh Mahadik, decided to face this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months to fulfil the dreams of his husband.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, his husband Mukesh Dubey was a hero in the army and became a martyr in the motherland.
Her wife Nidhi decided that she should join the army and fulfilled her determination.
It is natural for every countrymen to have a sense of respect for these brave hearts.
I convey my heartfelt regards to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, during the festival of Navratri and Diwali, there has been a huge opportunity for the youth of the country.
This year, the FIFA World Cup is being held in our country.
I am sure you will have to hear football all around.
Generations of every age group will have to increase their interest in football.
It is not possible that our youngsters are not seen playing in schools and colleges in the country.
Come, the entire world is coming to play on the soil of India, let us also make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is the time of worship of Mother Durga.
How the entire atmosphere is covered with the pure fragrance.
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the entire country is celebrating festivals, on the other hand, there is a news of violence from any part of India then it is natural for our country to be concerned about Buddha and Gandhi Ji.
The country of Sardar Patel is the land of those who have laid down their lives for the country's unity.
Generations of our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence, with equal respect.
We have been listening to 'Ahimsa Paro Dharma' since childhood.
Even from the Red Fort, I had said that violence will not be carried out in the name of faith, whether it is communal belief or belief in political ideology, be it faith in a person or belief in a tradition, no one has the right to take law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the countrymen that this country will never tolerate the laws and the people who suppress the path of violence.
Everyone will have to face the laws.
Because of the cultural traditions of thousands of years, if we see the cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events then perhaps in 365 days there will be no relaxation for one day which will not remain untouched.
Now you must have seen that our festivals are going on according to the nature cycle.
There is a simple relationship with nature .
Most of our festivals are associated with the farmers.
First of all, I would like to call you "Michami Dukkadam".
Yesterday, the festival of Sansadri was celebrated in the Jain community.
In the Jain community the festival of autumn is organized in the month of Bhadrama .
On the last day of the auspicious festival, there is a day of commemoration.
This is a unique tradition.
The day of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it also turns into a day of forgiveness and on this day it is a tradition of calling each other 's forgiveness ' .
We have heard this thing and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say - forgiveness is the specialty of a strong man.
Shakespeare has written in his drama the importance of compassion in The Marchant of Venice, "Marcy is Two Blest, Wit Blesset with him gives a hit takes and forgives those who have been forgiven, both are blessed with the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great joy in every corner of the country.
When there is a subject of Ganesh Chaturthi then it is natural to speak on the Ganesh festival .
The festival of Ganesh-Chaturthi is going on for ten days.
This Mahasana is regarded as a symbol of unity, equality and well-being.
Ganeshotsav greetings to all the countrymen.
Recently, the festival of Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
Onam, one of the colourful festivals of India, is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
Currently, our festivals seem to be the cause of attraction for tourism.
I would like to tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal, in a way, has become an attraction for tourism.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in that direction.
In the series of celebrations, the festival of Id-ul-uha will be celebrated across the country on a single day.
Id-ul-uha greetings to all fellow citizens.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and belief for us.
We have to make our New India a symbol of cleanliness.
In family life, festivals are associated with cleanliness.
Cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it is essential to have a social habit.
Cleanliness should become an integral part of our country, not just in the house, in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernisation is changing.
Eco-Friendly Ganapati is a big campaign.
If you look at the YouTube then the daughters of every household are becoming Ganapatis and they are making Ganapatis by bringing the soil.
Somebody is colouring vegetables, somebody is chapping paper pieces.
Different types of experiments are being conducted in every family.
And it seems that when I know new experiments.
Three years ago, when Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
Toilets have reached nearly 67 per cent from 39 per cent in power.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of the flood was drained then dirt was spread everywhere.
On the occasion, the workers of Ulema-e-Hind at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat performed sequential cleaning of 22 temples and 3 mosques in a sequential manner.
The sweat was sweated, everyone came out.
Excellent examples of unity for cleanliness, inspiring examples, were given by all the activists of Ulema-e-Hind in Jamia.
We have dedicated ourselves to cleanliness and if it becomes our constant feeling then our country can go somewhere.
My dear countrymen, I once again challenge all of you that once again 15-20 days before the birth anniversary of 2nd October Gandhi, I used to say 'Swachhta Hi Seva' and 'Swachhta Hi Seva'.
Create a clean environment throughout the country.
We should look for opportunities whenever we get the opportunity.
But we all come together.
On holidays or Sundays come together and work together .
We will go to the surroundings but we will work with a movement.
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social and cultural political leaders, government officials, collectors and Sarpanches to create an environment of unprecedented cleanliness for 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water Sanitation, MyGov.
In an in-house, a department has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can write your name and the name of the family that you have helped.
My friends from my social media can run some constructive campaigns and actually become an inspiration for the world.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is organising the Swachh Siddhi Competition, Essay Competition, Short Film Making Competition, Painting Art Competition.
In this we can write essays in different languages and there is no bondage of age in them.
You can make short films with your mobile phones.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness drive.
Once again, I would like to reiterate that this time, on 2nd October, we should take a pledge to commemorate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October. And for this purpose, from 15th September, Swachhta Hi Seva will reach every household.
He took some steps for cleanliness.
It should be part of it by working hard.
You see how Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after this 15-day Swachhta Abhiyan, on 2nd October, when Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated, it will be a pleasant pleasure to pay homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to specially accept my loan.
I express my heartfelt gratitude not because we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time. I want to express my gratitude and accept the loan that millions of people of the country are connected with the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I get the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
As you look forward to Mann Ki Baat, the more eagerly I wait for your message.
I am impatient because I get to learn something from every one of you.
I express my gratitude to all of you for your contribution.
We will be connected to our mobile phones and we will become a part of these wrong habits.
Prime Minister, I speak Aparna from Pune.
I would like to tell you about my friendship that she always tried to help the people, but I was tired of seeing her habit.
Once I had gone to the shopping mall with him.
We make payments on a large scale, but we do it with our hardworking brothers.
Don't you think that some of the goods that are sold at home, some of the things that are sold at a pass ferry, sometimes they are related to the sellers of small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, sometimes they are connected to the Otto Reservoirs, whenever they are connected to the people who are suffering from problems, then we are concerned about them.
Not only this, he wants to reduce the bill by Rs. 2-5. And he used to go to a big hotel.
The question for him is not of rupee but of how much trouble his heart may be.
He is poor and hence his honesty cannot make a difference in your lives for two-five rupees.
Madam, I am grateful that you have given me a message by calling the heart-touching phone.
I am sure that even my countrymen will leave this kind of behavior with the poor.
My dear young friends, the entire country is celebrating 29th August as National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to hockey is incomparable.
I would like to recall this thing that I believe that the new generation of our country should be connected to sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are young countries of the world then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports is physical well-being, intellectual readiness, emotional co-existence.
I understand what more needs to be done than this
In a way, sports is a burden that connects the heart.
Our young generation should come forward in the field of sports. Today, in the age of computers, I want to tell you that sports are more important than sports stations.
Playing fIFA on the computer but doing some work on the outer field .
The joy of playing cricket on the open ground is different from the cricket on the computer .
There was a time when the kids of the family used to go out and they used to ask, "You will rejoice at home.
Today the situation is such that as soon as the children come home they watch games or cartoon films on the mobile while sitting in the compartments then they have to ask the mother whether you are going out or not.
There was a time when mother said to the child , ' Have you ever come to know such a time when you will be going out '
Our youngsters are happy to note that the FIFA World Cup is being organised under 17 years from 6th to 28th October.
Today, as I was talking about sports, I would like to tell the people that last week there was a touching incident.
I got the opportunity to meet a young girl. Some of them were born in the Himalayas.
Sometimes he spent 30-30 days in water, this is the first incident in the world with snow in the waves of the sea.
Who would be an Indian who would not feel proud of Asian girls
I salute the courage of these daughters and I invite them to share this experience with all the countrymen.
I will also provide a different place for Narendra Modi's experience.
Because we must read their experiences because it is an adventurous story of adventure and I am glad that the story of these girls has reached us. My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
It is the birthday of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
Teachers have an important role to play in creative emotions and enjoying knowledge among our students.
This time when we celebrate Teachers Day, can we make a solemn pledge
And I would like to show you the path to realise that we should make a solemn pledge for five years and after five years we will be able to enjoy the solemn pledge and enjoy life.
There is such an incident in the life of every teacher that his efforts have transformed the lives of someone.
If we make collective efforts then we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I work for the Indian Research Centre at Harvard University, Mumbai.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana Economic Inclusion is a matter of discussion not only of India but of pundits all over the world.
The scheme was started on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, the scheme will be completed by three years.
30 crore new families have been connected and bank accounts have been disbursed.
Today, I am glad that the poor people of the society have been made a part of the economy of the country.
Now an atmosphere of restraint has been created.
He feels that money will be used for children.
Something can be done in the future.
Moreover, if a poor person sees RuPay card in his pocket then he feels like a sage, he has a credit card in his pocket, he has a RuPay card in his pocket.
He feels a harmonious feeling.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Rs. 65 thousand crores have been deposited in the banking sector.
This is their strength in the coming days and the insurance cover for the accounts that have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been removed.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) is one rupee and thirty rupees.
In some families, due to a premium of one rupee, if something happens to the mainstream of the family then his family will get Rs. 2 lakhs.
Today it is not so much time but I would like to tell the people of the bank to upload it to my gov. in.
My dear countrymen, once again I bow down to you.
Thank you very much.
The human mind is such that he feels very fond of the rainy season.
Animals, birds, trees, nature all are pleased with the arrival of monsoons.
However, sometimes this rain takes the form of a record and then it becomes clear that there is such a power to bring about destruction in water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us but sometimes it is terrible to see the floods and earthquakes in such natural calamities.
Whatever changes are taking place in the changing weather and environment, they are also having a very negative impact.
During the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North Eastern States, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, are facing natural calamities due to heavy rainfall.
The flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Whether it is the Indian government's army, the air force, the NDRF people, the paramilitary forces, all these people themselves are associated with the service of the disaster victims.
Farming, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electrification and connectivity are all affected.
People are also talking about their problems.
Gradually, we can manufacture timetables for our work as per the weather forecasts, which can prevent potential losses.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I can see the citizens of the country preparing for it more than me.
I have received a lot of letters on the subject of GST, a lot of phone calls have been received and people are still enjoying the GST as well as expressing their condolences.
One of the phone calls will also be heard by you: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I would like to speak to Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the address of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, GST was introduced in our country on the same date last month.
The way the government had expected this decision and whether the results are being received after a month or not, what can we say
I want to hear your thoughts about this.
The GST has been implemented for about a month and its benefits have also started becoming visible.
When a poor person writes a letter to me about how the prices of essential commodities of the poor have come down due to GST then I feel extremely satisfied and happy.
What was the reason for not knowing that GST was initially alarming, but now you are learning about it, so it seems as if it is easier to work in the remote mountains of Ishaan.
These facilities are not only available but they are also being supported for the economic momentum of the hinterland.
The speed at which this change has been brought about smoothly, the speed at which this place has been changed, the new registration has been done, has created an atmosphere of confidence in the entire country.
Scholars in the field of economics, scholars in the field of management and intellectuals in the field of technology and sometimes put the experiment of India's GST in the form of an ideal system before the world.
This will be a case study for many universities of the world.
This is because there has been such a big change in such a large number and it is a big step to successfully implement this tax in such a large country with the participation of millions and millions of people.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre in unanimous terms.
As a result, every government has prioritized that due to GST, there should not be any excessive burden on the cost of food grains.
You are well aware of the fact that what was the price of a thing before the GST and what was the price of a new situation, all the information is available on the GST App on mobile phones.
I sincerely congratulate all the Ministries, all the departments, all the Central and State Government employees for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of Indias collective powers.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a concept but a system that strengthens a new authentic culture.
In a way, it is also a mission of social reform.
Once again I salute crores of people of the country for completing such a big task in a smooth manner.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a way, several such incidents have taken place in the month of August that are associated with the history of independence.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people would be aware that Dr.
Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Your new generation should know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
What could be a bigger inspiration than this
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had made the entire country free from the British rule.
This was the time when India had become a part of the uit India Movement against the British rulers - Indian public opinion, every corner of the country, be it villages, cities, be it educated or uneducated or be it poor or be it Shrimant.
Replying to Mahatma Gandhi's call, millions of Indians gave their lives in conflict with the mantra of 'Karo Ya Muro'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had given up their education and had left their books.
Ladies and Gentlemen like Lohia and Jayprakash Narayan played an important role.
In both the collaboration movement and the uit India Movement - 1920 and 1942, two different forms of Gandhiji are visible.
The format of the Cooperation Movement was different and in 42 years, such a situation arose so sharply that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karo-Maro'.
It was the peoples support, the peoples capabilities, the peoples resolve and the peoples struggle behind all these successes.
Sarah was fighting unity.
Sometimes I believe that if we look at the leaves of history then India's first freedom struggle was established in 1857.
This freedom struggle, which began in 1857, was going on in some or the other parts of the country till 1942.
This lengthy period awakened the feeling of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone is committed to doing something or the other in that direction.
Generations have changed but the resolutions have not moved.
People used to come, they were connected, they went out, new people used to come and the country was making every effort to wipe out the British rule.
This would have been decisive for five years.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
In 1947, we became independent.
Today, the year 2017 is going on.
The incident took about 70 years.
Governments came and grew in time.
Arrangements have been made, changed, changed and increased.
Everyone has tried their best to make the country problem-free.
Efforts have been made to increase the employment opportunities in the country so that poverty can be overcome.
They also suffered in their own way.
We have also achieved success.
The expectations were also raised.
For example, from 1942 to 1947, it was five years of resolution.
Similarly, I see that the period of five years from 2017 to 2022, the journey of accomplishment, is now before you.
May this 15th of August, 2017 be celebrated as a solemn pledge. And when we complete 75 years of our Independence in 2022, we will fulfil that resolution.
Today, it is not just the announcement of 'Karenge Maarenge' but it is not the pledge of connecting with this solemn pledge of a New India.
We want to live and fight with this resolution.
On August 9, this year, I will run a campaign from the resolution to its achievements.
Every Indian, every social institution, every local system, schools, colleges, different organisations - everybody should make a new resolution for New India.
And a resolution that will be fulfilled in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We will become a part of this pledge festival and today we will definitely be online whether we are anywhere else or not.
Therefore, I invite my young friends, especially those who are coming online, to come forward to contribute in a new way in the creation of a New India.
Using technology, we should take up all these things like video, post, blogs, eyes and new ideas.
May this mission become a mass movement.
uit India uiz will be launched for young friends on the NarendraModiApp.
This question on uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will spread it on a wider scale.
My dear countrymen, as a Prime Servant of the country on 15th August, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort.
I am only on the occasions.
Send your views on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
I read it myself and I will try to put this idea in the number of hours I get on 15th August.
During the last three years, I had heard a complaint about my 15th August address that my speech was a little longer.
I will complete it in maximum 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a social economics in the economy of India.
And that economics can never be underestimated.
Our festivals are not just a matter of joy and joy.
Our festivals are also a medium of social reform.
But at the same time, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
In a few days, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Festival, the fourth moon after that, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Diwali will come together and this is the time when the poor get an opportunity to connect their economies.
And a natural joy mixes in these festivals.
And if we talk about the economy then several months before the festival of Rakhi, hundreds of families start making supplies through small household industries.
No matter how many types of reserves are made from Khadi to silk treasures and nowadays people have started liking homemade and household shelters.
Thousands and millions of people are associated with this festival.
It is directly related to those poor families who have made small lamps of soil.
But today, while talking about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals and festivals, I also want to take up the issue of environment.
And they have urged me to talk about the eco-friendly Ganesh idol in the context of Ganesh Festival so that people can imagine the idol of soil from now on.
At the outset, I am grateful to these aware citizens.
He asked me to take up this topic beforehand.
This year's Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
And I am sure that you all will be associated with this solemn pledge.
And this will provide employment to the poor artisans and poor artists and will fill the stomach of the poor.
We should make every effort so that we can connect our festivals with the poor, we should connect our festivals with the economy of the poor, we should make our festivals a celebration of the economic benefits of the households of the poor, we should make every effort so that they can get the joy of economic prosperity.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens for the upcoming festivals.
We feel proud and proud of our daughters.
Just a few days ago, our daughters demonstrated their sporting activity in front of the Womens Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
I felt very nice to speak to him, but I realized that the World Cup did not win.
This stigma was visible on his face.
I told them a different analysis.
I said, "You see, there is a time of fame now that expectations are increased in it.
It is being increased so much that when success is not achieved then the same aspirations change.
We have seen a lot of sports in which if a sportsperson of India becomes irresponsible then the country's anger is expressed on those players.
Some people leave their limits and talk about things that are extremely painful.
But it was for the first time that even though our daughters did not win the World Cup, 125 crore Indians took the burden of defeat on their shoulders.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the country.
Once again I congratulate the young generation of the country, especially our daughters from the bottom of my heart.
Every citizen of the country should make a solemn pledge and every citizen of the country should make a solemn pledge in the next five years.
Let us move forward together, let us do something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The weather is changing.
Summer was also very strong this year.
However, it has been delayed, it has been rainy season and its next step is in smooth pace.
Rainfall in many parts of the country is adventurous due to heavy rainfall.
After the rains, the car drivers have been relieved of the sunlight in the last few days.
And all of you have seen that however rushing in life, however stressful it may be, be it personal life or be it public life, the advent of monsoon changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm in many parts of the country.
Nowadays in some parts of the world, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
The people whom Dr . . .
Babasaheb Ambedkar had studied and he must have seen that he would appreciate the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannath Ji because it involves social justice and social harmony.
The holy month of Ramadan was celebrated with a sacred spirit of reverence.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is the month of donation of Pune.
It is a month of enjoyment and as much enjoyment grows.
Let us all come together and take inspiration from these sacred festivals and take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, an inspiring incident took place in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
The families of about three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in those small villages. In a way, the population of our Muslim families is more there.
During this Ramzan, the villagers have decided to construct toilets together.
The government also provides assistance to these individual toilets and under this assistance, about 17 lakh rupees have been given to them.
You spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villages of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy day into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
One of his things is also very inspiring.
And most importantly, he made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
You are aware that three states of Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, the government and the people for completing this work.
Then somewhere that organ of the body or the mind falls.
This is also the subject of cleanliness.
These evil habits have become part of our habits.
We have become a part of our habits.
We will have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everybody will have to take care of them.
We will have to recall the good inspirational events.
And I am happy that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It has become a movement for the common man.
And when the people sitting in the government take this work forward with public participation then its strength increases manifold.
Recently, a wonderful event came to my mind, which I would like to tell you.
This incident is in the district of Vijayanagaram in Andhra Pradesh.
The administration has taken up a major task from the public participation.
100 hours of tireless campaign.
And what is the goal
Make toilets in 10,000 households in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be glad to hear that people and administrations have successfully completed 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages became Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate the people, government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district. They have set an inspiring example with relentless hard work.
Prakash Tripathy's awareness about democracy is commendable.
And democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
The consciousness of the inner world is the price of freedom.
Regular awareness about democracy is essential and therefore we used to remember those things that were inflicting on democracy and move forward towards good things of democracy.
June 1975-25 was such a period that no democratic lover could forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into turrets.
The opponent's tunes were pressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country, including Shri Jayprakash Narayan, were present on the occasion.
The judiciary too could not escape the shadow of the crisis.
Newspapers were made completely unemployed.
Today's journalism, the students of the world, the people working in the democracy, are constantly trying to raise awareness about the democracy by remembering the dark period.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in Turunga.
When the Emergency was completed one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and described the situation in his poem.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is proud of the world today.
21st June, 2017, the entire world had performed Yoga.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning through Yoga.
An Indian who would not be proud of it.
Its not like that Yoga was not practiced earlier but today Yoga has become a cause of connectivity to the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity for Yoga.
People practiced Yoga in The Great Wall of China, while people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 meters from the sea level in Machu-Pichu, Peru.
People practiced Yoga in the shadow of the IFFI tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India offered a separate dimension to India's friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghan Friendship Dam.
Yoga classes were organized with Yoga Masters at UN Headquarters.
In Gujarat, around 55 thousand people from Ahmedabad have recorded a new world record by performing Yoga at the same time.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time, I got the opportunity to do Yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers performed Yoga in Siachen where they had a temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Whether it is our Armed Forces, Border Security Forces, ITBP or CRPF, everyone has made Yoga our part with their work.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this is the third International Day of Yoga. Therefore, I had said that send me photographs of three generations of the family while doing Yoga together.
Some television channels also took up this issue.
Several photographs have been sent to me and some of them have been collected on the NarendraModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit my favorite programme.
During the last few years in Kerala, P.
N.
Panikar Pratishthan organises a good programme, and reading months are celebrated to make people aware of the habit of reading books and to make people aware about reading public books.
I also remembered the fact that I had dealt with carefully.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that if we dont want to offer floral tributes then we would like to give a book or welcome him with a handkerchief.
That too, Khadi handlooms so that Khadi can be encouraged.
When I was in Gujarat, we all had a habit, but after coming here I had a habit.
However, he went to Kerala and once again that habit became aware.
And now I have started informing the following people in the government.
We can gradually become a habit.
The lives of flowers were very low.
Once I took it in my hand and I kept it in my hands.
But if a book is given then it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a part of the family.
When I am talking about this thing, then how many such things were historical values.
Last year when I had gone to England, ueen Elizabeth of Britain had invited me to dinner.
Lotali for many years, but ueen Elizabeth has kept the handkerchief given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I visited, I was very happy to see that.
And when I was looking at it, he was urging me to touch it and see it.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am convinced that these habits do not change at all and whenever they say that vaccines become wealthy.
However, we have to tell these things, we have to keep trying.
Now I cant say that if I go anywhere and someone offers me a bouquet then I will deny it.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Ministers, there are many kinds of works.
However, I have developed a habit for me that I read a few letters from the letters I received and that is why I get the opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different types of letters come in, different types of Manse letters are written in different ways.
Recently, I would like to read a letter and I would like to tell you about it.
Arulmozhi Sarwan, a housewife from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, afar off South India, sent me a letter.
And what was happening, he wrote that he thought of taking some financial initiatives in his family keeping in mind the education of children etc. so that the family could get some financial help.
I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started the work towards supplying some goods from the market.
Some people were asked, I have registered it myself. I would like to tell the countrymen that you should also get the same opportunity.
There is a new kind of arrangement to visit GeM.
Whoever wants to supply goods to the government, who wants to sell the bamboo, who wants to sell the bamboo, who wants to send the table, he can register it on his name.
The people who register under EEGM, all the departments of the government look after it.
With no agents, many things are cheaper.
The Arulmozhi Madamney registered the goods that the government can supply on this website.
And it is interesting that the letters he has written to me are very interesting.
He has written that once he got the money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started, I wrote to him about what he could supply to E-GEM and I received orders from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what the Prime Minister's Office would ask for.
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arulmozhi didn't write to me, I wouldn't have noticed that in the E-GEM system, a housewife is working far and wide and can be procured from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
There is transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace-GeM
I wish that those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way, they should make themselves more connected to it.
I believe that this is an excellent example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and what is the goal - Minimum Price and Maximum Accessibility, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we take pride in Yoga and on the other we can take pride in our achievements in space sciences.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground for Yoga then our dreams are to overcome the horizons of the sky.
A few days ago, India has done a lot in the field of sports and science.
Today, India is placing its address not only on land but also in space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) with Cartosat-2 Malike satellite.
And in addition to India, these satellites included satellites from almost 14 countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
And India's Small Satellite Campaign will greatly help in the field of agriculture and natural calamities.
A few days ago, you might have noticed that ISRO had successfully launched GSAT-19.
And it was the weightiest satellite in the satellite that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers of our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
You can imagine how great our scientists have done in the field of space.
On 19th June, the Mars mission completed 1,000 days.
You would be aware of the fact that the entire expedition was underway for a period of six months when we had successfully secured space for the Mars mission.
We are sending photographs, information and scientific information, we have been working for longer than the stipulated life.
Having completed a thousand days, it is important for our scientific journey to space.
At present, we are seeing the achievements of our youth in the field of sports.
Recently, Indian Badminton Prince Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open Championship and honoured the country.
I sincerely congratulate him and his coaches for this victory.
Just a few days ago, I was fond of shooting P.
T.
Usha got the opportunity to participate in the inauguration of the Synthetic Track of Usha School of Athletics.
We will encourage sports as well as sports.
Sports plays an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in holistic personality development is uncommon.
There is no shortage of talented sportspersons in the country.
If the children of your family are interested in sports then they should be given opportunities.
They should not be taken up from the fields and closed in the rooms and encouraged to study.
Even if they study, if they can showcase the splendid achievements, but if they are fond of sports, then the schools, colleges, families and the surrounding people should inspire them and encourage them.
Everyone should have a dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget the summer of this year.
Just wait for the rain.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the auspicious occasion of the holy month of Ramadan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and around the world, especially to the Muslim community.
Prayer , spirituality and charity are given a lot of importance in Ramzan .
India is very fortunate that our ancestors have created such traditions and today India can take pride in this thing that we can make 125 crore countrymen proud of the fact that all the sects of the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and those who deny God.
There are people who worship idols and people who oppose the statue.
Every kind of ideology, every kind of puja system, every kind of tradition is here and we have inherited the art of living with each other.
And in the end, be it religion, sect, ideology or tradition, all these things give us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely help in taking forward this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all.
I am very happy to say that many people have responded to it.
Individually, everyone showed me the zeal of telling me something in your heart.
I have not read anything, I have not heard the message of everyone, so many things have come up.
However, some people have tried to learn music, some have tried to put their hands on new words, some people have been trying to learn new things by using YouTube and some people are learning new languages.
Some people are learning pockets, some are learning dance, some are learning drama.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems.
Some people are trying to understand nature and live with nature.
I am very happy that I would like to make a phone call to you as well.
"I speak Daksha Katyal.
When I started fighting for the freedom struggle, I realised how much struggle and sacrifices were being made for India's independence.
I was greatly inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some message to the new generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, about our freedom fighters, about those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men spent their lives for freedom in Turanga and climbed the throne of several young folks.
And that is why today we breathe in a free India.
You must have seen that the great men who had laid down their lives during the freedom struggle did a great job of writing and studying and their writings also strengthened India's independence.
I had visited Andaman Nicobar a long time ago.
I had also visited the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote the book "Majhi Janmathep" in Turunga.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were locked in small places.
What kind of torture would have been achieved by the freedom fighters
When I read Savarkar's book "My Birthday", it inspired me to see the Cellular Jail.
A sound light programme is also presented there which is very inspiring.
There will not be any such state in India, there will not be a single linguistic group in India, none of whom will not be able to spend their lives in the cellular rush of Andamans when they will be punished for their freedom.
The people of every language, every region and every generation have suffered this pain and today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say - One must care about a world one will not see.
It is our duty to take care of the world that we have not seen.
If you are very tired then open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe in the fresh air, you get a new consciousness.
Whenever we get in touch with those five great personalities who have formed their bodies then there is a new consciousness in our body and a new energy emerges.
We all have experienced this thing but we never take care of it, we dont bind it in a single thread.
You must observe that whenever you come in contact with your natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge inside you.
And therefore, the global mission of connecting with the nature of 5th June should become our mission.
We are getting some benefit from our ancestors who protected the environment.
If we protect the environment then it will benefit the future generations.
And if we see Atharvad then it is the biggest guiding text of the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth: Sono Aham Prithviva:
It is said in the Vedas that the purity that we have in us is due to the Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
When we recall Lord Buddha, one thing is obvious that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the realization of his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana were underground.
But in modern terms, it needs to be pursued with modern logic.
We have linked the world with Yoga.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, mind and soul, it unites today.
Todays lifestyle is becoming difficult due to race and increasing responsibilities.
This stressful mind is being seen from a very young age itself.
Yoga plays an important role in leading a stress-free life in such a time when medicines are being taken and the days are being washed away.
Yoga is a way of ensuring health and strength.
Yoga is not just exercise .
It is possible through yoga that we have to travel in an intersection with the health of the body, mind, thought and ethics.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to all the governments and leaders of the world.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some schemes.
Gradually, work will be done in that direction.
I have received an instruction and I congratulate all those who provide this valuable idea.
There is a lot of psychological information.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga, and on that occasion, you should urge the three generations of the family to do Yoga together.
All the three generations - Azi-azoba, i-Baba, son-in-law should do yogasana together and upload their photographs .
Yesterday, today and tomorrow will have such a beautiful breakthrough that will give Yoga a new dimension.
I am grateful to you for suggesting this idea. And I believe that just as we had started the campaign of selfie with daughter and had got a very interesting experience, similarly these three generations will be able to share the pictures of Yoga together in the country and the world.
Where three generations are performing Yoga, you must send a combined photo of those three generations of the country on NarendraModiApp and MyGov.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow will be the photo that will ensure a golden future.
I invite you.
The International Day of Yoga is yet to be completed in three weeks.
In a way, this resistance is a movement for health conservation.
I invite all of you to participate in it.
When you gave me the responsibility of your chief servant, when I got the opportunity to speak for the first time from the Red Fort on the 15th of August in my tenure, I had talked about cleanliness.
Since then, my journey has been going on in different parts of India. And I have noticed that Modi has been taking a good look at what Modi has done.
This is because I have received a very lucky phone call and I must have thought in the same way as he said.
But I am grateful to him for taking this thing into consideration.
You should also listen to this telephone.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
On Modi ji TV and social media, I always see that wherever you go, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
The elders are not only participants but also children are aware of cleanliness.
Small kids are often seen preventing adults from wasting their roads.
The cleanliness drive that you have started from the Ghats of Kashi has taken the form of a movement inspired by you people.
You say it is true that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleanliness but recently there is a festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before I reached there, seven days ago, ten days ago, a massive cleanliness drive was launched.
Just a few days ago, I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a massive cleanliness drive.
But I didn't know the relationship between these two things.
But after this telephone call I thought that this thing is true.
You can imagine how pleased I would have been by remembering this thing and the country too is taking note of these things in such a way.
What else would be a matter of joy for me than being connected to my visitors
While there is a habit of preparing for the rest of the preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister, cleanliness has become a key factor in it.
It is also a matter of joy and inspiration for anyone who loves cleanliness.
Imagine is very good, but I have to think about it.
But it is true that this movement should continue and instead of giving a visit to some goods and memories, it is a good thing to do with the amazing tons of garbage coming out of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It will be a great humanity.
Once we started treating this waste as a wealth that many new methods of waste management will come up before us.
Youth associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and new instruments.
Government of India has decided to open a massive mission of waste management with the help of governments of the states and with the help of people's representatives of cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, about 4,000 cities will have similar tools for collection of solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of garbage will be provided, one of which will be of green color and the other of blue color.
Two types of waste are produced - one wet waste and the other dry waste.
These wastes will be stored in 4,000 cities and we will put dry waste in blue waste and wet waste in green waste.
For example, the garbage that comes out of the kitchen, it includes vegetables, raw food, egg garments, papaya, this is all wet garbage and put it in green waste.
In other types of waste materials such as waste papers, lips, iron, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken bins, rubber, metal etc, all these things are dry waste.
I am sure that we will develop such a culture and we will have to take a new step in the direction of cleanliness and we will be able to fulfil the dream of cleanliness that Gandhiji saw.
Today, I want to mention one thing with pride that even if a person decides his mind then he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is one such task.
For nearly 80-90 weeks, the citizens of Versova sea shore were tortured and thousands of tonnes of waste were sold and today Versova beach has become clean and beautiful.
Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV) took full responsibility for this work.
Brothers and sisters, today I want to share one more thing with great pleasure and I was told that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, this part of Reasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate all the citizens of the Reasi Block, the administrators there for setting an example for Jammu and Kashmir.
And I have also been told that the leadership of this entire movement was the women living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took a torch morch there for awareness and inspired people by visiting their homes and streets.
I congratulate those mothers and sisters from the bottom of my heart, I congratulate the administrators of that place who have started a good start by making a block of humidity free on the land of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, the past three years of achievements of the present government are being reviewed from the newspapers, TV channels and social media.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
These three years of work have been carried out on every criterion.
People from every section of the society have analyzed it.
Somewhere praise has been given to him, somebody has supported him, somewhere some errors have been registered, I consider all these things important.
I also express my gratitude to those who have given critical and important responses.
If we focus on errors and deficiencies then we get an opportunity to improve them.
It is essential for a conscious nation and a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and the impact of a good White is on me as much as it will be on the minds of a common man.
It seems as if I am sitting in my family and taking care of the things at home.
And there are hundreds of families who have written this thing to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, when we meet again, every corner of the country will receive a new joy, a new fragrance and a new fragrance.
Come, let us move ahead with love and affection for nature in such an environment.
My best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like a seeker, the numerous contributions made by the oppressed sections of the society, on the other hand, are often not seen by the government.
All the information that comes from time to time for Mann Ki Baat was analysed in detail in the government.
What are the types of information, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
Normally it has been found that man has a habit of advising others.
If someone coughs while traveling by bus or by train then immediately another person asks him to do this.
To advise, to advise and to advise is as if something is in our habit.
Most of the informers are those people who are trying to reach me who really do something or the other in their lives.
They are trying their best to improve something according to their intelligence, strength, capability and circumstances. And when I came to know about this thing then I realized that these are not normal information.
Some people also do this because they feel that if these ideas are there, wherever they are working, if the other people listen to them and they get a comprehensive form then many people can benefit.
And that is why they naturally want to mention this thing in Mann Ki Baat, all these things are very positive in my view.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to most of the information that is worthy of action and people who are doing something or the other for the society.
Moreover, whenever I mention something, I feel very happy to know about such things.
Last time, in Mann Ki Baat, some people had informed me about food was being washed away and I had mentioned that.
And after that when I mentioned it on the NarendraModiApp, several people from every corner of the country used it with innovative ideas to avoid the food used by them.
I had never imagined that today the younger generation in our country has been working for several years.
We have heard that some social institutions have been doing this thing for the past few years but the youth of my country have participated in this thing.
Many have sent me videos.
There are several places where the poultry bank is going on.
The people of these pools deposit their pots, collect vegetables and take away the required people from there.
Those who provide relief, those who take it do not feel humiliated.
This is an example of how work is being done with the cooperation of the society.
Today is the last day of the month of April.
States of Gujarat and Maharashtra are being established on 1st May.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have consistently strived to scale new heights of development.
He has contributed to the progress of the country and his life continues to inspire us in every sphere of the society and in every sphere of the society. Remembering these great men, we should make a pledge to take our state, our country, our society, our city, our family on the foundation day of 2022, 75 years of our independence.
We should make plans to take that resolution forward and move ahead with the participation of all the citizens.
Nature has also changed the rules of sports.
The summer summer of May-June in our country has driven a glimpse of it in March-April.
And when I was asking people about Mann Ki Baat, most of the people have informed me about what to do during this summer.
s.
Many such friends have expressed concern about the birds .
He has said that water should be kept on the grass in the verandah and I have seen that small children from the family like this work.
Once they came to know that why they used to fill this water with 10 times a day so that they can see whether the utensils that have been stored have water or not and they keep looking at whether the birds have come.
You feel that this game is going on, but indeed it is a wonderful feeling of awakening this feeling in the minds of children.
You too have seen that a bit of flora and fauna makes you feel a new joy.
Just a few days ago, Shri Jagat Bhai had sent me a book from Gujarat, Save the Sparrows and he had expressed concern over the reduction in the number of sparrows in it. However, he himself did experiments, tried to protect him in the form of a campaign.
However, in our country, animals and birds, nature has coloured us with them. However, it is essential that we should collectively strengthen such efforts.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Samaj, Syedna Saheb, had completed 100 years.
He lived 103 years.
And on his 100th anniversary, the Bohra community had launched a massive campaign to save the bedspread from the evils.
I got the opportunity to inaugurate it.
He had distributed around 52 thousand Bird Feeders to every corner of the world.
He has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are so busy, we are the newspaper throwers, weeders, weeders, postmen, we are the home buyers but we forget that the days of summer are the days of summer should we ask them if they want water.
Friends, Young friends, I have to make some mistakes with you.
I sometimes feel conscious that many of our younger generations are happy to lead a comfortable life.
Parents also keep taking care of them in a defensive condition .
Some others are also of other points but most of the comfortable situations are visible.
Now the examinations have been over and plans have been made to enjoy holidays.
It feels comfortable even after summer vacations and summers.
However, as a friend, I would like to say something about your vacation.
I am sure some people will certainly experiment and will also tell me.
If you make three proposals for this holiday then it is a very good thing but try to do something out of three.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
At times there is a difference between watching something on TV or reading in books or listening to familiarities and feeling the same thing by oneself .
Experiments should be positive and should be carried out beyond comfort.
We belong to a middle class family and we belong to a happy family.
Sometimes experience it, I dont say that do it again, do it once again.
In the evening, take your football, take a volleyball or take the literature of any sports activity and go to the poorest of the villages.
You will find that you should play with those poor kids yourself, you should see that you have often enjoyed sports before.
Children living such a life in the society will get the opportunity to play with you. You have ever imagined how big a change will be brought about in their lives.
And I am sure that once you go, you will feel humiliated.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several voluntary organisations are working serving.
Sometimes very hot camps are there .
Personality is of development, it is of several types of development, it is possible to participate in it.
However, at the same time, you feel that you have done such a bright sunshine, you have done a personality development course, you can reach out to those people of the society who have not got the opportunity and those who have been taught you should teach them.
You can teach them how to do it.
I was also worried about the fact that technology has come to reduce the gap and technology has come to an end.
Each of the peoples technologies has shifted to the other side.
Today is the era of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot of people in life is a good thing and the idea of doing something is good.
However, please see that the human element within us is not confused, we are not going anywhere far away from human qualities.
Can we give some fillip to this pulse in skill development
Efforts are being made to spend time with oneself, away from technology.
Whether it is Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati or Marathi or Punjabi, any musical instruction, or any musical instrument, or any other language.
And if we look at the diversity of our country then we can get a lesson from anybody around us.
If you don't swim, learn to swim, draw pictures, don't get good pictures, but try to put something on paper.
The sensitivity within you will have to appear.
Sometimes we say small things - why don't we want to learn or not
You see, all these new experiments, this skill is such that it will give you joy and will take you out of what is built in a framework of life.
Friends, do something outside Chakori.
This is an opportunity to make life.
And you might be wondering if all the examinations are over and if you go on a new round of work then that opportunity will not come.
And that is why I tell you that if you have the rhythm of learning magic then learn the magic of your wives.
Keep showing magic to our friends and friends.
You will be sure to try to know something that you don't know.
Your inner human power will be conscious and it will be a great opportunity for development.
I tell you from my experience that the more we learn from the world we cannot imagine.
New places, new cities, new cities, new cities, new villages, new premises.
After going to a place, stay for three days and four days.
Then go to another place and stay there for three days and four days.
This will help you to learn a lot.
When you go, you must send me a photo of that place.
Have you seen what new
Where do you go
You can share your experiences with HashTag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the government of India has also given you a lot of opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
You also do it but you can also earn from this scheme.
The Government of India has a plan.
If you are downloading the BHIM App, you will also be using it.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your accounts.
If you get it done by 20 people in a day, you can earn 200 rupees by evening.
Even the traders can earn and the students can earn.
And this scheme is till 14th October.
You will contribute to making Digital India.
He had become a symbol of VIP culture, however, the experience was telling us that Lal Divas used to fall on the vehicle, he used to fall on the vehicle but gradually he fell on the head and this VIP culture was deeply rooted in his head.
Now only the red lamp has been laid, so no one can claim that the red lamp that has been laid in the head would have come out.
I have received an interesting telephone.
In this telephone, he has expressed his courage, but this time the telephone shows that the common man does not like it.
He feels a kind of irregularity in this.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shiva Choubey, Jabalpur is from Madhya Pradesh.
I was very proud to hear the everre Indian is a VIP on a road written in the newspaper. And I was happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam and I don't want to stop for anyone.
Therefore, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this decision.
Going to red light through government decisions is a part of the system.
However, we have to remove it from our minds.
If we all make concerted efforts then we will be able to take it out.
Our theme of New India is to increase the importance of EPI in place of VIPs in the country and when I say EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is clear - Everie Person is Emport.
Every individual has a significance, every individual has importance.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore Indians, if we accept the importance of 125 crore Indians then how powerful it will be to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that we should recall our history, culture and traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of the 125 crore countrymen, Sant Ramanujacharya.
Because of some reason, we were so small that we kept thinking about it for centuries.
For other countries of the world, centuries will be of great importance.
However, India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years old memories in its philosophy.
Just imagine it.
Even today, if we talk about social conventional solutions then how many problems are there.
How would it be a thousand years ago
He himself did his behaviour to the society that he considered untouchables.
Thousands of years ago, he had organised a movement to enter his temple and had successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every age, great men have been born out of our society to wipe out the evils of our society.
As we celebrate one thousand years of the birth anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya ji, we should draw inspiration from them to inspire the spirit of social harmony and unity.
The Government of India will also release a Postage Stamp on 1st May to commemorate Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
I salute Saint Shri Ramanujacharya Ji and pay homage.
My dear countrymen, May 1st, 2019 has a special significance.
It is also celebrated as Workers Day in many parts of the world.
And when it comes to Labour Day, Labour and Labour Consultations are held then it is quite natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the concessions received by the workers today.
Babasaheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, I talk about Saint Shri Ramanujacharya ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of the 12th century of Karnataka Jagat Guru Basveshwar ji.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
It was a programme to dedicate his pledge to the people.
In Kannada language, he had said - "Kai Kave Kailas" means - you can obtain the Kailash of Lord Shankar's house with your hard work, i. e.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
I have been talking about 'Shrayam Jayate' again and again.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Thangdi after his death.
My dear countrymen, a few days later we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The problems faced by the world today are violence, war, destruction, arms race and whenever we see such an environment then the thoughts of Buddha are very relevant.
And in India, the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that Vesak Day is celebrated on the occasion of this great festival of Buddha Purnima by the United Nations.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Their memories will get an opportunity to illuminate.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And when we talk of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on May 5th.
The capability and connectivity of this satellite will be immensely helpful in fulfilling South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
Most of the families in most parts of the country will be in the examination of their children.
Those whose examinations have been conducted, there will be some stress-free environment and those whose examinations are still going on, there will be some stress in those houses.
But I would like to say this thing that during the last time I had heard what I had told the students from Mann Ki Baat.
During the examination, those things will certainly be useful for us.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic fight against injustice, a remarkable victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of the Wang-Brothers.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day. And I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a supportive partner of Bangladesh.
We are a good friend and we will continue to participate in peace, security and development in this entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that the memory of Rabindranath Tagore is our shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British gave him the title of Nighthood.
When the British slaughtered civilians in large quantities in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, then Rabindranath Tagore was one of those great men who raised their voices against this incident.
This was the period when this incident had a strange effect on the mind of a child of 12 years of age.
During the adolescence, the young man who laughed in the fields and plantations had given Jallianwala a new inspiration for life by the brutal genocide of the garden.
In 1919, he was a 12 year old boy, i.e. our sons, we all are inspired by Shaheed Bhattasingh.
Three days ago, on the 23rd of March, Bhagat Singh ji, his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British.
At that time, the service of Mother India was satisfactory and there was no fear of death on the faces of Bhagsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
He had sacrificed his life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three brave hearts are still an inspiration for us.
Bhattasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru's sacrifices will be decorated with words.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit that place and I felt that there are special pomps in that land and I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to visit Punjab then you must visit the tombs of Bhattasingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhattasingh Matoshree and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the time when the pace of independence was increasing and the pace was expanding.
On one hand, heroes like Bhattasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So, just a hundred years ago, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had embraced the Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom struggle of India, a manifestation of Gandhian thoughts and Gandhian style was seen during the Champaran Satyagraha.
This was an important turning point in the entire journey of our freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of the methods of struggle.
This was the time when the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, the elimination of the mill workers in Ahmedabad and the deepest impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts and style of functioning can be seen.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Gandhiji.
Just imagine, a person returns to India in 1915 and just two years of work.
The country was not aware of them, nor did they have any effect, it was just the beginning.
You can imagine how much hard work they must have suffered at that time.
Champaran Satyagraha was an event in which Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, Mahatma Gandhis ability to recognize the pulse of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhis vision of uniting, motivating and fighting the poorest of the poor and the underprivileged against the British rule and therefore we feel the immense power of Mahatma Gandhi.
We can learn from him and it was during that period that the big leaders whom we hear, Gandhiji, Rajendra Babu and Acharya Kripalani had sent them to the village.
And the British didn't know what was the way Gandhiji's work, what was the way it was, the struggle was also going on and new construction was going on.
One side was conflict and the other was creation.
On the one hand, we have to lay down ourselves in constructive work.
125 crore Indians will be transformed and the foundation of a New India will be laid due to this.
New India is not a government programme or a political party's announcement.
New India is an appeal to 125 crore Indians.
There are many people who often go to hospitals, they serve patients, there are many people who run for blood donation at the expense of their need.
Many people worry about the stomach of the hungry.
Our country is multi-purpose.
Peoples service is divided into our nerves.
If we look at it in a collective manner and look at it in an organised manner then it is such a great power.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge that I will follow the rules of transportation, if every citizen decides that he will fulfill his responsibilities honestly, if every citizen decides that he will not use petrol-diesel for a day in a week, he will see that things are small.
You will see that the dream of New India, the dream of 125 crore Indians, will be fulfilled before your eyes.
It means that every citizen should follow his religion, follow his duties.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude.
In the last few days, an environment has been created in our country that people have joined the Digital Payments and Digital Movement.
After demonetisation, there has been an increase in different types of digital payments.
BHIM App has been started only for two to two months but nearly 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it so far.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion Indians will make a solemn pledge for digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
125 crore Indians dont have to wait for a year if they do this thing on their minds.
This work can be done within six months.
2,500 crore digital transactions, if we have to pay a school fee or not, we will pay a digital payment in the journey of railways and in the journey of air travel.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several digitization fairs have been organised for public education and public awareness.
It is a pledge to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been organized .
There was also a Bakshis scheme in it.
About 5. 5 lakh people have got the benefits under the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
Seventy thousand traders have earned their dues.
A big event will be held at the end of 100 days.
There is a system of big discount.
I believe that we will propagate BHIM App in the number of days that are still in your hands for Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti.
How to reduce the cash consumption and how to reduce the use of notes
My dear countrymen, I am glad to say that every time I ask people for information about Mann Ki Baat, there are several different kinds of suggestions but I have seen that there are information about cleanliness.
Honourable Prime Minister, my Namaskar, I congratulate you all for the first time that you have won these elections with great hopes.
I would like to tell you something in my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness by themselves.
Everyday I go through that river where most people pollute the river by putting garbage in large quantities.
This river flows from the Rispana bridge to my house.
I want to say that we should bring this thing out through a group or a Newspaper.
Brothers and sisters, There is a lot of difficulty in the eleventh-teaching girl child.
Seeing the garbage in the river it feels very angry .
I consider this to be a good sign.
This is what I want that 125 crore countrymen should have a sense of hatred towards dirt.
Ever since the Swachhta movement has started, there has been awareness among the people.
Everyone has been connected to it positively.
Now this campaign has become a movement.
There is a lot of hatred about cleanliness.
Awareness and active participation is of different significance.
But cleanliness is more related to habits than the movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habit of cleanliness and it is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be done in a collective manner.
The work is difficult but we have to do it.
I believe that the spirit of awakening among the new generation, children, students and youth of the country will automatically indicate the results.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be the message of everyone from Mann Ki Baat.
Have we ever imagined that how much waste of food we give us
Have you ever imagined that it is not a waste of food or a waste of food
This is not a subject that needs to be explained.
When the food increases to the mother in her household, she says that the child should eat as much as he wants.
There are some attempts but the sadness about it is a social treason.
This is an injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if the savings are done then the family will get economic benefits.
I don't want to talk much about it but I feel that awareness should increase.
I am aware of some youngsters who run such campaigns.
He has created a mobile app.
Wherever food is washed or swallowed, they communicate to other people and utilize that food.
The youngsters of our country are making such efforts.
You will find such people in every state of India.
Their lives also inspire us not to waste food, increase food as much as you want.
The people who are cautious about health always say that the stomach should be kept slightly empty.
I would like to tell the countrymen that sadness is not an incredible disease.
A psychological environment has to be created and treatment starts.
Its first mantra is to reflect and open instead of pressing sadness.
Tell your colleagues, friends, parents, feelings and teachers in an open manner.
Sometimes the problem of loneliness is more for the students living in hostels .
They don't come near food tables.
Have you ever noticed why he does that
We know that this is the first step towards depression.
If he avoids staying with the entire family and goes to a single compartment then keep in mind that this will not happen.
Look at those people with whom he speaks openly.
Inspire him to become a man by laughing, open the knot in his mind.
This is the best solution.
Depression can become the cause of psychological and physical disorders .
The way diabetes invites all diseases , in the same way fighting , adventure , decision-making capabilities are attacked and this ability is destroyed .
Your friends, your family, your environment can keep you away from getting disturbed and if you are sad then you can get out of that mood too.
There is one more solution.
If we cannot get open to the people near you, do one thing, go to such places where the work is being done with the help of service.
If we try to understand their grief with the spirit of service then a new confidence will emerge in our minds.
By combining with others, serving anybody and serving with selflessness, the stress on mind is easily reduced.
As such Yoga is also a good way of keeping mind healthy .
Yoga is very useful to get rid of stress, to get rid of stress, to get rid of stress and to feel happy.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
You should also prepare from now and celebrate the collective yoga festival in the number of lakhs.
If you want to make some suggestions on Yoga Day, then you should guide me through my mobile application.
You can compose songs and poems about Yoga so that the subject can easily reach out to the people.
In the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is a matter of great gratitude that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
He maintains the responsibility of the family, he has a hand in the economic responsibility of the house, which sometimes leads to injustice to the newborn.
The Government of India has taken a major decision in this regard.
Maternity Raja, who used to get 12 weeks before, will now be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery.
In this regard, two or three countries of the world are ahead of us.
India has taken an important decision for these sisters.
Its root cause should be the care of a newborn child who is the future citizen of India.
In a childhood, if he gets the love of his mother then this child will be the glory of the country tomorrow.
This will also improve the health of mothers and hence this important decision will benefit about 18 lakh women.
May we get inspired from the lives of these great men, may we get the strength to make a solemn pledge for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year End Review, New Year greetings to you all.
It is time for the farmers to get the crop ready after the spring season and the fruits of their hard work .
The New Year is welcomed in different parts of our country in different ways.
Gudipadwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmir Navreh in Awadh, Santsar Puja in Awadh province, Jud-Shilla in Mithila region of Bihar, Satuwani in Magadh region.
India is a country with numerous diversity.
I convey my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
Many-many thanks.
Winter is now over.
The spring season has entered the lives of all of us .
The fascinating smell of the fruit of summer season is seen in the breasts only .
At the same time, yellow flowers of peacock in the fields renew the minds of the farmers.
The dried flowers of ribs indicate that Holi has come.
Amir Khusro has made a funny description of the moments of change in nature.
Amir Khusro wrote, "Fool Rahi Sarson Gross Bun, Amba Foot, Tesu Phule, Coal Bole, Dar-Dar.
"When nature is happy and the environment is happy, humans also enjoy this season.
The festival of Basant Panchami, Maha Shivratri and Holi fills the colour of joy in human life.
We will satisfy the last month of Falgun in an atmosphere filled with love, brotherhood and humanity and we are ready to welcome the next Chaitra month.
The spring season is the confluence of these two months.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to the millions of people of the country for this thing that whenever I ask for a vote, whenever I ask for a suggestion then I receive a lot of information.
Bhubaneswar, I thank you for remembering India's pride.
Be it poverty alleviation or prevention of diseases or be it attachment to the world or be it knowledge or be it information or be it technology or be it technology or be it technology or be it technology or be it technology or be it the best way to connect with the world.
February 15, 2017 is a day of great pride in Indias lives.
Our scientists have lifted Indias head in front of the entire world with pride and all of you are aware that in the last few years, ISRO has successfully completed several missions.
ISRO has established a global record in the space sector in the last few days after successfully successfully sending the Mars mission to Mars on Mars.
This success will be historic not only for ISRO but also for the entire country.
ISROs Coast Efficient Efficient Space Programme is a wonder for the entire world and the world has openly applauded the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites is Cartosat 2D. It is India's satellite. And Mola will be used for photographs, information, mapping, infrastructure, development information and urban development planning.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how many water bodies are there in the country and how can we use them
It is also a matter of happiness for us that our young scientists and women scientists have led this campaign.
It is a matter of great pride for ISRO's success that such a huge participation of youngsters and women is a part of India's success.
On behalf of the entire nation, I congratulate ISRO scientists.
These scientists have retained the aim of using space science for the service of the nation to the common man and are recording new records.
No matter how much we congratulate our scientists and their entire team, it will be less.
India's scientists have done this.
The capability of this missile is such that even if there is any missile to attack India from a distance of 2000 kilometers, our missile will destroy it in space.
We are happy when we see some new technologies and some new scientific discoveries.
They don't stay healthy when they don't get the same answer.
And if we observe the journey of thousands of years of human evolution then we can say that this journey of development is not complete.
New science and new technologies emerge from it and every technology, every form of innovative science, creates a new era.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, several times I have said this through Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today's scientific excellence can be a cause for a sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
A few days ago, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organised a unique competition on the occasion of the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Social useful discoveries were invited.
Sometimes the problem underscores the importance of science to find answers.
Mumbai received heavy rainfall in 2005, floods in Mahapur, sea conditions and several hurdles.
Whenever there is a natural calamity, the most critical is that of the poor.
Both of them worked very closely and developed a system of housing that will save the household, save the people living in the house, save the water from coming home and save the diseases caused by polluted water.
The system is also becoming technologically vibrant.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, there has been an increase in the emphasis on DG-Funds.
Especially the younger generation is getting used to making digital payments through their mobile phones.
I believe this is a good symptom.
In our country, in the last few days, there has been a lot of support for the Lucky Grahak Yojana and the Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana.
It has been almost two months and every day 15 thousand people are getting Rs. 1,000 per day.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making digital payments in India a mass movement has been welcomed across the country.
It is a matter of great pleasure that under the DG-Dhan Yojana, more than 10 lakh people have been rescued, more than 50 thousand traders have been given the rewards and people who have taken this great work forward as a savings of more than Rs.
In this scheme, more than a hundred consumers are those who have received Rs. 1 lakh per annum.
There are four thousand traders who have received Rs. 50-15 thousand rupees.
Shri Santosh from Mysore expressed his happiness and wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received a thousand rupees in the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
But I believe that he has written a very important thing to you people.
He wrote that when he received a thousand rupees, he realised that the house of a poor woman was set on fire and all the goods were burnt in that fire.
Santosh ji, our youth and our work are giving us satisfaction.
You have done a very inspiring job.
Twenty-twenty-two-year-old driver of Delhi, Bhai Sabir, has now been associated with digital transactions and he has received one lakh rupees in the government's lucky consumer scheme.
A young student from Maharashtra performs Pooja Namade, Postgraduate Courses, who are experiencing the use of RuPay cards and e-wallet in his family and enjoying it.
One lakh rupees prize is so important for him, but he has taken up this work as a practitioner and is connecting others with it.
This movement has played a very important role in the fight against justice, corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work, for me, is the anti-corruption cadre of the country and the anti-corruption bloc.
In a way, you are the soldiers of Shutchai.
On 14th April, a huge settlement of Rs.
There are still approximately forty-five days.
Remembering him, let us teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Teach us how we can deal with it.
Particularly teach those who are small and medium traders around us.
Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary and BHIM App will be given special importance.
And that is why I want to tell you that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
BHIM App has to be installed in every household, in every household, in every household and in every 125 crore hands.
As a result of the movement that has started in the last two-three months, several urban settlements, many villages and many cities have achieved great success.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector contributes immensely at the core of our country's economy.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have strived hard to fill the wheat warehouses.
This year's record production is due to the hardships faced by the farmers of our country.
All the records are telling us that our farmers have already made records.
This year there has been such a crop in the field that everyday it seems that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than 2,700 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
It is more than eight percent more than the previous record in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
Thanks to the poor of the country for their traditional crops and because the poorest of the poor get the maximum number of pulses.
I am glad that the farmers of my country have heard the voices of the poor and they have loaded different pulses on nearly two hundred nineteen lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is a great service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
My request is that my farmer brothers and sisters deserve special thanks for the way my farmers have worked hard and produced record pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, some initiatives are being taken by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations and by everyone in terms of cleanliness.
In a way, everyone seems to be aware of cleanliness in some way or the other.
The government is also making constant efforts.
Just a few days ago, a programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments led by our Secretaries of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, was organised in Telangana.
What is the significance of not communicating in the closed rooms in the heritage of the state of Telangana, but direct sanitation
Using this thing a toilet pitting exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17 and 18 February .
The toilets of six houses were cleaned by evacuating the pits and the authorities themselves showed that the pits used by the Twin Pit toilet can be used again by evacuating them.
He also demonstrated how convenient the toilets constructed using these new technologies are and there is no difficulty in cleaning the toilets.
As we do other cleaning, we can clean a toilet.
And if we look at the fertilizer as a fertilizer then it is black gold in a way.
You can see how waste generates wealth and it has been proved.
A standard twin pit toilet for a family of six people, which will be filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and left in the other pothole.
Solid waste waste was dissolved in six to twelve months.
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium are rich in nutritious substances and it is considered a very good farming fertilizer.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken such initiatives.
Now a special programme has been started on Doordarshan.
The more it will be broadcast, the more it will benefit.
The Swachhta Pakhwada is being organised regularly by different departments of the Government.
In the second phase of the month of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
You are aware that whenever any citizen of our country does something good then the entire country feels a new energy and confidence increases.
We welcomed the performance of our Divyangjans at the Rio Para Olympics.
The country is proud of the success of these Divyang fellow citizens.
I often believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, they are determined, they are courageous, they are determined.
Every moment, we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not left behind.
She has moved ahead by step and has been bringing laurels for the country with her success. Just a few days ago, our women's team won the silver medal in the Asian Rabby Sevens Trophy Games.
I convey my best wishes to these sportspersons.
Womens Day is celebrated across the world on 8th March.
In India too, there should be greater awareness and sensitivity in the family and in the society to give importance to the daughters.
The mission of 'Mulgi Bachao-Mulgi Shikshawa' is moving at a rapid pace.
Today, this is not just a government programme.
It has become a movement of social sensitivity and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been associated with this initiative.
This initiative has played a crucial role in discussing this vital issue in every corner of the country.
It has brought about a change in the mindset of the people about the old customs that have been going on for years.
It is a matter of great joy when we get the news of a festival celebrated after the birth of a daughter.
In a way, positive thinking about girls is causing social acceptance.
I have heard that in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kundalor district has been imprisoned for child marriage under a special drive.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked with the 'Mulgi Bachao-Mulgi Shikshawa' scheme and a lot of efforts are being made by the district administration to ensure that the orphan girls get their education along with organizing Gram Sabhas.
In Madhya Pradesh, Har Ghar Ghar Ghar Ghat is aimed at educating every village and every household in the country.
In Rajasthan, an initiative is being taken to motivate the girls left out of schools to re-school their schools and educate them for their education.
New ideas are being linked to it.
It has changed as per local requirements.
When we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling: Woman, Woman, Power, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman, Woman of India.
We would have been actively involved.
I am extremely grateful for your participation.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
This festival reminding the Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens and our commitment to democracy, is a celebration that brings about a democratic edition of the generations to come.
However, there is not much discussion about the rights and duties of the citizens in our country as widely as they should be discussed.
I hope that the more important the taxpayers are given at every level, the more important the rights are given.
I pay my homage to the martyrs who have laid down their lives for the country, after a two-minute silence at 11 a.m.
On the 30th of January, at 11 a.m. these two minute silences should become our comfortable habit as a society.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the families of the brave soldiers who have been awarded different gallantry awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Specific Service Medal, etc.
I especially urge the youth of the country that you are very active on social media.
Can you do one thing Can you find out about the brave hearts who have received this honour at this time and write two good words about them and reach out to your friends
When we are deeply familiar with the courage, valour and valour of these heroes, we feel proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were happy to read the news of 26 January celebrations, while on the other hand, soldiers deployed in Kashmir had to lose their lives due to avalanches.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers, I salute them.
My young friends, you are aware of the fact that I keep telling you my Mann Ki Baat.
The months of January, February, March and April are a period of great difficulty in every family.
Almost every household has one or two children's exams but all the families had gone beyond that exam.
Then I thought that this time is appropriate for interacting with my student friends, their parents and teachers because for many years, wherever I go, wherever I go, there is a lot of care for the children's exams.
A very strange mental condition is visible in every household that the family is worried, the students are careful and the teachers are deteriorating.
When I was going to talk about this topic, several teachers, parents and students sent me messages, asked me questions, sent some suggestions, problems and difficulties.
I would like to share with you the ideas that have come to my mind by reading them all.
I received a telephone message from the universe.
Sir, let me tell you that during the exams, there was a very horrific atmosphere in our homes, neighbours and societies.
It doesn't mean that we can stand up to the minds of the students, but we are distressed.
I want to ask you whether this environment cannot be pleasant
The question is true but it will emerge in the minds of all of us.
There are very few people who can see pleasures in the examination.
For most of the people, there was a pressure.
It is true that you people have to decide the pleasure.
The person who faces this examination with pleasure will get the same trifle and the person who takes the pressure will get the time of regret.
Therefore, I believe that you should face the tests as if something should be a festival.
This is the strength of festivals.
The entire family should enthusiastically fulfil the role of taking this festival to its full potential.
On seeing the pictures will change .
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there are only three-four months of examination.
For these three-four months, in accordance with your traditions, in accordance with the environment of your family, change it during the festival.
And that is why I will tell you, Smile More, Score More.
In a stressful situation all the doors are closed , nothing can enter from outside and can not come out inside .
The thought process stops and these things get overwhelmed.
And you dont have knowledge, lack of information, lack of hard work, where is it
But when there is tension, your knowledge, your knowledge, your information gets over there and stress is there.
It is important to keep in mind that A happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes I feel that we do not look at the exams from the right perspective.
We have a mindset that it should be a question of life and death.
Whatever you have done during the year, this test will be just about that.
Your entire life will not be required there.
It is not a test of how you have lived your life, how you are living yourself, how you are living yourself in the future.
Besides the examinations conducted in classrooms, you might have gone through several cases.
Then let us be free from such evils, and let us be faced with the neighbouring President of the country, Dr.
J.
The biggest challenge that I have faced in today's era is education.
Marks are getting a lot of importance.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the stress on the mindset of the students.
I want to know your thoughts about the current trend of education system and its future.
Though he has answered the question in his own way, Risha wants me to share some opinions on this subject.
There is a limited utilization of qualities and merits.
If you believe in these things, you will never need to run behind them.
You will be able to leverage your knowledge in your life, you will be able to leverage your self-confidence and determination.
Would you like to see the mark sheet of a lawyer when you go to fight your big challenge
The successful journey in the field of experience, knowledge and clientry can be seen there.
That is why Markanch sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
Richa ji has also taken up the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a huge mental battle.
I am telling you that it is easy to understand the examples of sports.
Most of the successful sportspersons have a unique feature that they compete with themselves.
Let us take this example by tendulkar.
Twenty years ago, he knew his own record turn and went ahead with his own defeat.
It should be a wonderful one because they followed the path of self-competitiveness rather than competing with others.
Even in every field of AYUSH, you should ask yourself the same question about studying, I could practice for two hours calmly, should I study for three hours now
Earlier it was too late to get up in the morning, should we get up early
Whether it is possible to sleep due to exam stress or not
He further said, My mother was not much educated.
Yet I had to settle down and I had to quit maths.
I would only like to tell the parents that they should focus on three things, accept, teach and give time.
Parents may feel that the expectations of their teachers and their children are the root cause of many problems.
The burden on you will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask a single question regarding the condition of that person.
When he came, he started listening to Vinodi jokes.
In just four-five minutes, the atmosphere was stagnant.
Eravi keeps the patient afraid of the diseases that he is going to meet.
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we are very nice to the children.
Have we ever thought of providing a joyous, smiling environment to the children during examinations
Do that, the environment will change.
I have received another big call from Kamali.
He says, "Greetings to the Prime Minister, I cannot mention myself because my childhood work was done by me.
Once I had tried to copy my child.
And when I tried to copy it directly then I got caught in it too, I had a lot of trouble with my close friends.
These short-cut roads become the reason for copying.
You must have heard this many times.
I will say the same thing again.
Anyhow, the effect of copying will be seen.
The same creativity, if the time is spent on the exams then perhaps it will not be necessary to copy.
A phone call has come to me, she says, Namaskar Prime Minister, my name is Monica and I am a 12th student, so I want to ask you some questions related to board exams.
My first question is about increasing stress during these examinations, how can it be reduced
"If I talk about sports during the exams, your teachers, your parents will live on me.
It would be a matter of gratitude to the Prime Minister who used to ask children to play during exams.
Because in sports, we got to know that less attention is being paid to studying.
This thinking is fundamentally wrong.
The root cause of the problem is there.
Let us take a couple of moments out of our studies and look at the sky, look at the trees around us, let us make a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit.
Whether it is for five minutes but leave the rest on your own .
You will see that the work would have been more progressive.
I dont know whether everyone likes it or not but my experience tells me the same thing.
For this there is no need to sit in the room.
Go to the chair, take a five minute long breath and then sit for study.
Some people understand that if you wake up late at night then it will be a lot of practice.
But not.
Definitely take as much sleep as is necessary for body .
Your efficiency will increase altogether.
I go to the polling booths and sometimes my voice is sitting.
I had come to visit a folk singer during such a meeting.
They asked me, "How many hours do you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously.
If you do, you will be able to live up to me.
It is a very big medicine to keep mind , mind , body alert .
Young friends, you are busy preparing for exams and I am stuck in my minds.
My speech may help you overcome the stress of your mind.
But at the same time, I would also like to say that do not take the things that I have said on my mind.
If you gather, do it or don't do it or else it will become a burden.
Don't impose a burden of expectations on the children. I am also sure that your parents have told me.
Your determination is to overcome the tests by believing in yourself.
My best wishes are with you.
Give the form of a festival to cross every case.
There will be no examination.
You should move ahead with this mantra.
Dear Countrymen, on 1st February 2017, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers of the Task Force and the jawans for their patriotic service.
The Indian Coast Guard, with 126 self-made ships and 62 aircraft, is supposed to be the fourth largest Coast Guard in the world.
As per our vision, the Armed Forces personnel are in the forefront of safeguarding the maritime boundaries and maritime areas of the country.
Last year, the people of Takshak forces took pride in making the coastal areas clean along with their responsibilities.
Thousands of people participated in it.
They are truly complimented for maintaining cleanliness along the coastal areas.
Very few people would be aware of the fact that not only the men in the coastal forces of our country, but the women are also working on their shoulders with the same commitment and they are successfully fulfilling their responsibilities.
Our women officers of the Task Force are aeronautical, observers and are also managing the responsibilities of Howardcraft.
On his 40th anniversary, I salute the Indian Coast Guard, who is keeping India's coastline safe as the issue of coastal security is being raised globally.
Bamboo Panchami will be celebrated on 1st February.
It is considered to be the day of the prayer of the students.
Not only this, this is an inspirational period for the heroes.
The song Mera Rang de Basanti Chola shows the same inspiration.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, while broadcasting Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio also fills it with its innovation.
Mann Ki Baat gives you a great opportunity to connect with you.
Many congratulations.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and deeds in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said, We need to accept the poor if they do not take advantage of us.
St. Luke has written in the Gaspel that he not only served the poor but also praised the service done by the poor. And this is the empowerment in the true sense.
A story related to it is very popular.
It is said in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasure of a temple.
Several Shreemans came and donated a lot.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and she put two copper coins in it.
Now if we go to see what is the value of two copper coins .
The devotees standing there were amazed.
Then Yessoon said that the widow has donated the most and the others have donated a lot but this woman has donated everything to her.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development projects in Varanasi, which was the land of Malviya ji.
I laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never forget the contribution made by Atal ji.
He also elevated the countrys pride in the field of nuclear energy under his leadership.
Whether it is a party leader or a member of Parliament or a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji has created an ideal in every field.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray for his good health.
As an activist, I was fortunate to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are awakened before my eyes today.
In the morning when I tweeted, I shared an old picture of how Atal ji's affection as a small worker would be sure to see it in the picture.
Today, on the day of bathing, the citizens of the country will get the benefit of two schemes.
In a sense, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn and understand from each other.
To encourage this, the Central Governments Promotion Scheme for Consumers and Small Businesses (CBSBs) has been launched from today so that mobile banking can be strengthened.
Lucky Consumer Scheme is a scheme to promote consumers and Digi Dhan Business Scheme is an initiative to promote traders.
The scheme will start from today and will continue for 100 days.
Each day 15,000 people will get an amount of Rs. 1,000 each.
Besides, one day in a week would be a big discount for the customers who will receive lakhs of rupees and after three months they will be released on April 14, 2018.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be on that day in a grand code where crores of rupees will be given.
Digi Dhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businesses should themselves participate in the scheme and also involve the consumers to prevent their transactions.
Independent bonds will also be provided for such traders and these bonds will also be in thousands.
The traders will continue to trade themselves and they will also get the opportunity to win the Buxis.
This scheme has been formulated keeping all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class citizens at the centre.
More than 3000 buyers will not be able to avail the benefits of this scheme.
The poorest of the poor can also purchase goods through a feature phone or a common phone using USSD, sell goods and also provide money and they can become beneficiaries of this scheme.
In rural areas, they can also buy and sell through AEPS.
30 crore citizens will soon be able to participate in this scheme.
Its very simple, the easier it is to send messages from Whatsapp.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to see that the awareness about how to use technology in our country, how to make e-payments and how to make online payments is increasing at a fast pace.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200-300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
The traders will certainly be able to guess how big this decision is.
Exemption from Income Tax has been granted to traders who will exchange digital transactions, who will facilitate online payments instead of cash in their operations.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
A committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Shri Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes and their implementation has started.
Someone told me that the government of Assam has decided to give 10 percent concession on payment of GST and trading liabilities through digital mode.
The branches of rural banks, which will be able to handle at least two digital transactions from January to March, will receive a discount of Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
He also announced that 100 digitally beneficiaries will be given a bond of Rs. 5 lakhs under the Goods and Services Panchayat for Digital Transactions by the Government till 31st March 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced to disburs Rs. 5000 to the first ten farmers who have fully digitally paid seeds and fertilizers under Digital Farmer Shiromani Yojana for the farmers.
I congratulate the government of Assam and congratulate the government of Assam for this kind of initiative.
Several organisations have successfully undertaken several experiments to promote digital exchanges among the poor farmers in the villages.
Someone has told me that Gujarat Narmada Khore, fertilizer and chemical fertilizer companies have installed POS machines at the place where the fertilizer is sold for the benefit of the farmers and in just a few days, about 35,000 farmers have purchased 5 lakh fertilizer seeds through digital means and it has been completed in just two weeks.
In fact, the fertilizer sales of the company increased by 27 percent this year as compared to the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, the coverage of the informal sector has increased in our lifestyle. And most of the time these people are given wages, work money or wages, cash payments and therefore the labour is being exploited.
Wherever you want to get 100 rupees, you get 80 rupees.
At the same time, they are also getting the benefits of other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easy for us.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have also made great strides in the field of start-ups.
These are golden days of the digital movement.
Our youngsters can empower this sector with new ideas, new technologies and new methods.
At the same time, we should also participate in the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption with full force.
My dear countrymen, I urge people to give advice and suggestions before Mann Ki Baat every month.
80-90 per cent of the suggestions received on MyGov and Shri Narendra Modi Power are on the verge of fighting against corruption and black money.
When I saw all these things, I distributed them in three parts.
It has been written in detail about the difficulties faced by the citizens and the neglect of the suggestions given to me by some people.
The other types of people have written that the work for the welfare of the country is going on in such a holy manner, no one is being misbehaved and how new paths of fraud are being explored.
Third kind of people have written insistently that this fight should continue to be carried out in support of what happened.
The number of citizens who insist that corruption and black money should be completely eliminated and strict action should be taken if required.
I express my gratitude to all those countrymen who have helped me by sending me such letters.
Shri Gurumani Keval said that this step taken to stop transactions of time is commendable.
We are fighting against corruption and black money just like the army forces.
The words written on the notes are wrong, the rates of sweets have increased, the notes of two thousand will be cancelled, the notes of 500 and 100 rupees will be cancelled.
However, the people of this country were stunned to hear all these rumors.
Moreover, many people came to the ground, they brought the true face of the people who spread the evils through their skills and wisdom, they proved that the rumors were wrong and brought the truth to everyone.
My greetings to this power of the people.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with us then nothing is impossible.
Janadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for taking part in this great mission of corruption and black money.
I felt that there should be widespread discussions in the House regarding the fight against corruption and black money.
Had the work of the House been done, there would have been a good discussion.
Some people are spreading the rumors of all kinds of concessions to political parties.
The law is the same for all.
Whether it is an individual or an organisation or a political party, everyone should follow the law and everyone has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in search of government errors.
There is a question of repeated changes in the rules.
This government is for the people.
Whose power has been involved in this period of dishonesty and corruption for 70 years
When I decided to fight these people, they started a new effort to defeat the government.
On the other hand, many citizens have also written letters to discuss non-transactions and various migrations.
The common man is giving more information than the information that comes from the government system.
Our success comes from the awareness of the common citizens.
The government has prepared an e-mail letter to provide such information and can be sent on it.
I am particularly grateful to all those who write such letters, their letters have faith and blessings.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of fatigue, there is no question of stopping. And the work for which 125 crore citizens are blessed does not raise the question of seizure.
You must be aware of the law relating to Benami Property which was enacted in 1988.
He was buried in basana.
We took it out and implemented the 'Effective Benami Property' Act.
In the coming days, this law will have to show its impact.
Our topmost priority has been to do whatever is required for the benefit of the country and for the welfare of the people.
Indias ranking in the World Bank Industry Report has improved.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and have jumped 19 places in the World Bank Domestic Performance Index in 2016.
The evaluation of several reports is giving directions in such a way that India is progressing rapidly.
My dear countrymen, this time the citizens of the country were displeased by the session of Parliament.
Everyone expressed his anger at the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also openly expressed dissatisfaction over it.
However, in such a situation, some good things happen and mind gets satisfaction.
A good work was done in the Parliament but the country was not aware of it.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud to say that my government has been moving ahead with the campaign for the Divyangjans in a legislative assembly.
I express my gratitude to all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this thing. I express my gratitude to them on behalf of crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is also committed to the Divyangjans.
I have personally tried to speed up the Sudha mission.
I wanted the Divyangjans to get their rights and their honour.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have renewed our efforts and confidence by winning four medals at the Paralympics.
He elevated the country with his victory and also surprised the people with his capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have a precious legacy and power like every citizen of the country.
I am glad that after the passage of this bill for the benefit of the Divyangjans, they will get more employment opportunities.
Reservation limit has also been increased to 4 in government jobs.
The Government has enacted a new legislation in accordance with the UN Convention.
In this, 14 categories have been added.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we have been proud of the fields of sports.
The Indian Cricket Team won 4-0 against the United Kingdom.
Some young sportspersons commended this.
If our young sportsperson Karun Nair tries, then K.
L.
Rahala played 199 runs.
Virat Kohli, the captain of the Kasauti team, also led the team with a good leadership.
Indian Cricket Association of Spinner Goldman R.
Ashwin, ICC has declared 2016 as Cricketter of the Year and Best Cricket Maker.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all of you.
Even in the field of hockey, a good news has come after 15 years.
The Junior Hockey Team has won the World Cup.
After 15 years of Tabbal, the Junior Hockey Team has named the World Cup.
Congratulations to the young sportspersons on their achievements.
This achievement is auspicious for the future of Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also made excellent performances.
Indian women's hockey team won the Asian Championships and recently Indian women's team earned bronze medals in the Asia Cup less than 18 years ago.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the players of Cricket and Hockey Team.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 should be a year of new joy and enthusiasm, all our resolutions should be fulfilled and we should scale new heights of development.
This New Year should also provide an opportunity to the poorest of the poor to lead a life of happiness.
I convey my best wishes to all my fellow citizens for the year 2017.
Thank you very much
Like every year, I had visited India-China Sierra to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the higher part of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of ITBP, the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Every time I go, but the experience of this Diwali was very different.
125 crore people of the country who had dedicated this unique Diwali to the soldiers and had dedicated it to the security forces were reflected in the face of every soldier who was filled with emotions.
Some poets, some pictures, some cartoons, some people made videos.
It means that every household used to be in the army's post and when I read these letters, I was very surprised.
These letters are full of emotions.
At the same time, an information was received on MyGov. Whether the coffee table book can be created by collecting the selected items in it
A soldier from our armed forces wrote to me: Prime Minister, the Holi of our soldiers, Diwali and every festival is on the border.
It seems as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the emotions that you have expressed about our Armed Forces during this Diwali will be limited to just a few occasions.
I urge you to adopt this habit as a society, as a nation and as a nation, be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it or be it a festival or be it or be it a festival or be it or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it a festival or be it or be it a festival or be it be
When the entire nation stands with the armed forces then the strength of our armed forces increases by 125 crore times.
A few days ago, Sarpanchs from the state of Jammu and Kashmir had visited me.
He was a member of the Jammu-Kashmir Panchayat Parishad.
They came from different parts of the Kashmir valley and there were about 40-50 people.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a long time.
They had come up with issues related to the development of their villages.
They had some demands. And when our dialogue started, the issue of the atmosphere in the Kashmir valley, the law and order situation, the future of the children came up.
In Kashmir, there was a hurdle in the discussions about schools being set up and I saw that all our countrymen suffered as much pain as they were.
He says that the future of children is not a school.
I urged them to pay attention to the future of these children.
Just a few days ago, there was a board examination where about 95 percent of the students and students of Kashmir had passed the board examination.
I would like to congratulate him for his enthusiasm but I thank his parents, relatives, teachers and Sarpanches of all Gram Panchayats from the bottom of my heart.
My dear brothers and sisters, I can say that whenever I asked for your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, all of you have sent a message on the same subject.
Everyone had to say that we should talk in detail about 500 and 1000 notes.
I was also aware of the fact that we will have to face many new challenges in our everyday life.
There cannot be a way of getting rid of the diseases that we have been facing for 70 years.
I can understand the difficulties faced by you.
Such a massive country, such a big country, such a storehouse of currency, a billion notes and this decision.
The entire world is watching the barracks, every economist is doing this analysis.
In the entire country, the central government, the state government, the departments of local bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends and friends have been working day and night, they have been connected with the spirit of dedication.
Despite all kinds of tensions, they are working very quietly, considering this work as a sacrifice of service to the nation and as an attempt to transform it.
They start in the morning, when will they complete the night
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Several such events come up for discussion on TV, newspapers and newspapers everyday.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those colleagues who have worked hard in this great yagna and have proved their talent.
The identification of strength was only when success was achieved after penalties.
I remember Changla when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank employees took the burden on their shoulders and the work that was not done in 70 years was done by them.
Today, once again he has accepted that challenge and I am confident that the resolution of 125 crore countrymen, the collective strength of all, will give a new strength to this nation.
But evil habits have spread so much that even today many people do not have that bad habit.
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, benami money, some people should find a way and bring it back to the system.
They are finding unlawful ways to save their money.
Saddened by the fact that he has chosen a way to use the poor.
They are trying to save money by misleading the poor by enticing them with temptations and temptations.
I would like to tell such people today that whether it is our will or not to improve or not, whether it is our will or not to comply with the law, what will we do with it
But do not play with the lives of the poor by making a mess.
And the government doesn't want our countrymen to face difficulties.
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Tirali, J. Hadra and Madhya Pradesh.
It is commendable that we have stopped the notes of 5000 and thousand.
I would like to cite several such examples from Mann Ki Baat to the people that they had welcomed these stern steps for the advancement of the nation even from the guerrillas.
Because we used to say that good days will come but no one thought that we will take such a big step.
The black money and the corrupt people have received a good deal after seeing the notes of 500 thousand rupees.
It will never be a better day for every Indian.
I am so glad that I feel so proud that the common man of my country has a unique strength.
People go there, eat there and after 2-4-6 days they go back to that place.
This is the strength of my country, in which there is a sense of service, a sense of sacrifice and honesty.
During the elections, I had launched the 'Chai Pe Charcha' initiative and it was discussed all over the world.
But I didn't know that we were married in 'Chai Pe Charcha'.
In Gujarat, a girl from Surat gave only tea to those who were married to her.
Once I saw the news on TV, when I came to Ushira at night then I saw that Dhekiyazuli in Assam is a small village named Dhekiyazuli.
What did they do when they received a vote of Rs. 2000
Nearby, four neighbouring women came together and went to the market and bought together and gave money using a note of Rs. 2000.
See how changes are being brought about in the lives of villages.
Some people immediately benefited from this mission.
When I got to know what happened, I got to know about the small towns.
This information was received from about 40-50 cities that due to the closure of these notes, the people who were left behind were not paying the money.
We are aware of the fact that poor people dont pay the money two days back.
These big people, who are familiar with them, who know that no one will ever ask them, they will not pay the money and they will be very tired of it.
Each municipality gets 50 percent of the tax balance.
However, due to the decision dated 8th March, everyone was able to gather their old notes.
Last year, about Rs. 3,500 crores had been collected in 47 urban areas.
You will be surprised to know that in a week, Rs. 13,000 crore has been deposited with them.
But I specially congratulate the farmers of my country.
I have been taking the figures for the crop production in this season.
The farmers have found ways even after facing difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions and has given priority to the farmers and the villages.
Small traders of our country send jobs and help in increasing economic conditions.
We have taken an important decision in the previous budget, just like the big malls, the small shopkeepers of the villages will be able to do their business for 24 hours.
Under the Mudra Yojana, initiatives were taken to provide loans to them.
However, it was natural for them to face problems due to this decision.
I would like to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You should also download the bank accounts on your mobile phones, you should also keep POS machines for credit cards.
Let us learn how business can be done without using a note.
You see, the way big malls and technologies enhance our trade, a small trading profession can enhance our trade with the common "Yujur Friendly Technology".
There is no possibility that something will go wrong and there is a chance to increase it.
I invite you to contribute immensely to the creation of a cashless society.
Technology roads are safe, trustworthy and rapid.
I am sure, I would like to convey my best wishes to the labourers and the hardworking brothers and sisters that they have been exploited.
But friends, you are my true soldiers and friends.
There is a unique opportunity for us to serve Mother India and to take the country to the economic summit.
The world is not as old as we have experienced.
We are aware of the fact that the previous generation did not know what was the case.
We are well aware of the kind of online banking and online ticket booking.
There is nothing special in it.
However, today, the country that wants to do a great job, its a dream, its a Cashless Society, it is true that 100 of us will not succeed but we have not started it.
If we start the Cashless Society then the goal is not far away.
Wallet means e-packet.
There are several types of cards available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have RuPay cards.
However, the poor have also started using RuPay cards after the date of 8th March, which has increased by about 300 per cent.
The way prepaid cards are available for mobile phones and prepaid cards for spending money in the bank accounts.
This work is so simple that just as we send Whatsapp, it is equally easy.
I am aware of the fact that the uneducated person has to forward a better Whatsapp.
Not only this, technology is becoming easier so that there is no need for smart phones for this purpose.
Whether it is a washerman, a vegetable seller, a milk seller or a present letter or a tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have put emphasis on simplifying this system.
All banks are working on it.
In the last two-four days, we must have read in the current letter of the last two-four days, the amount which was withdrawn during the use of such cards.
The technologies that are required for online expenditure will be in your mobile phones.
Moreover, at least ten families can ask at least half an hour or two hours a day to tell them what technology is and how technology is being used and how can we download our bank accounts
We have to undertake this campaign to make the country free of corruption, to liberate the country from black money and to get rid of the problems and problems.
If the common man learns this system then perhaps he will get rid of this work and if all the youth of India bow down to it then it will not take much time.
Within a month, we can stand as a modern India in the world.
And you can do this thing through mobile phones and you can do it everyday by visiting 10 houses.
I invite you not to stop with your support but to bring about a change in the army.
We have taken this fight forward to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the youngsters there have changed the lives of the nation and there were revolutions from the youth.
The country of Kenya has set up a mobile system M-Pesa, using technology, named M-Pesa.
This country has brought about a big revolution.
My young friends, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to do this individually, in schools, colleges, universities, NCC, NSS and individuals.
The most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji, is taking forward the Swachhata campaign.
I believe that cleanliness is inherent in their nostrils and that is why they remember the work of cleanliness on their fathers birthday.
He writes a poem by Harivansh Rai ji, one of them is Ole, one of the earthen pots, all the life of Masti ji, my introduction to Harivansh Raiharivansh Rai ji.
My dear countrymen, today through Mann Ki Baat, I have always associated myself with you in my thoughts, in my letters and letters.
Mann Ki Baat programme is broadcast at 11 o'clock but you will soon get to hear its translation from regional languages.
In every corner of India, Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other.
This festival is the second name of the life of Indians. Anyone who sees this festival will feel that it is natural.
From time immemorial, the tradition of festivals in India has changed over time.
However, one thing comes to mind in all these journeys is that the entire journey of festivals in India is linked with the mantra of 'Swasthya' - its length and breadth.
The basic purpose behind this is to expand the individual and personality, to expand our limited ideas from the society to the universe and to achieve all this through festivals.
Our ancestors have participated in the festivals in India in a scientific way in celebrating the festivals, in the festivals of festivals and festivals, in a scientific way how the weather is there, in what weather should be there, in what season should be eaten, what kind of crops should be taken by the farmers, what kind of crops should be added to the festivals, what kind of culture should be there for health.
Today, the whole world is talking about the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
The tradition of festivals in India is to enhance love for nature and to enrich everyone from children to elders.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we are celebrating a festival of charity towards everyone.
We take a holiday on Sunday, but the older generations of labourers, the Koli Bandhav used to take vacations on the new moon and the dawn.
This darkness is not the darkness occurring due to lack of light but it is also the darkness of darkness.
It is an attempt to illuminate the light of positivity by lighting the lamps on the occasion of Diwali and eliminating the dark darkness of the society, the faulty darkness of the individuals and the light of positivity on the occasion of Diwali.
Even though the households of the poor are utensils of soil, they look clean and shiny during the days of Diwali.
In that sense, Diwali is a mission of cleanliness.
But not only in the house but also in the entire area, cleanliness in the streets and cleanliness of the entire village is the need of the hour.
We should expand this tradition of cleanliness with that synthesis.
This festival of Diwali is no longer confined to India's borders.
Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world.
Many governments, parliaments and administrators from all over the world want to participate in the festival of Diwali.
Perhaps you would be aware of the fact that the US Postal Service issued a Postage Stamp on Diwali this year.
The Canadian Prime Minister has also shared his photos of lights on Diwali on Twitter.
The UK Prime Minister organised a grand event to bring together all societies on Diwali in London and participated in it.
There is not a single city in Britain that does not celebrate Diwali with great enthusiasm.
What is there in the photograph that the Singapore Prime Minister has kept on Instagram and shared with the whole world with pride
Sixteen women MPs of Singapore are standing outside the Parliament from the Indian side.
He told me that the Prime Minister of New ealand had just come here recently and he had to return to New ealand soon to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
I would like to say that this festival of light of Deepawali is a festival of inspiration to the global community from darkness to light.
In the festival of Deepavali along with new clothes and food items of various tastes cracks are played with a lot of interest .
Small kids and youngsters like to burst into flies.
Sometimes children don't dare to be enthusiastic, sometimes they try to make a big noise in one go and sometimes they invite a big crisis.
Sometimes we don't know what is happening around us, what is the possibility of a fire
During the days of Diwali, news of such accidents, news of fire and news of death is a matter of concern.
In the days of Diwali, many doctors are busy celebrating Diwali with their families.
In our country, the festival of Diwali is going on for a long time.
While celebrating Diwali, we also prepare for Chhath Puja.
In the eastern part of India, Chhath Puja is a very big festival. It is celebrated as a festival for four days.
This festival gives a very meaningful message to the society.
We get everything from what Surya Devata gives us, it is difficult to recognise what we get from direct and indirect Surya Devata.
Chhath Puja is a festival of the worship of Surya .
It is said that people worship the rising sun in the world.
But Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the sun is worshipped.
A massive social message is also given through it.
It is a feeling of gratitude for the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces of my future forces. And in the same spirit, I felt that this Diwali of this year should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the countrymen for the mission of Message to Soldiers.
Today, I would like to bow down to the people of the country that there is no feeling of love, pride and respect for them.
The way this spirit has become manifest, it has given every citizen a different strength.
Through your message, our security forces have got a new patience and a new strength.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons or actresses, all of them have expressed their feelings.
The media has recognized Suddha as an opportunity to express gratitude towards the Armed Forces.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, whenever a soldier is standing in the desert, somebody is protecting the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the industries and somebody is watching the safety of the airport, all these soldiers are performing numerous responsibilities.
I can imagine how proud this will be for the soldiers of my country.
Innumerable emotions have been expressed in a comprehensive manner on the Sandesh to Soldiers Hashtag.
Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has sent a poem to me.
I am talking about Shivani Mohan.
Our army brothers are getting a big boost in this mission of Sandesh to Solzers that we have launched on Diwali.
My cleric and brother-in-law were both officers in the army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
We have several officers in the Armi Circle on the borders of the country who are receiving very good messages and are getting a big boost.
I would like to appeal to the officers and soldiers of the army that their entire family and their wives too are making extreme sacrifices.
Through our message, the entire army community is receiving a very good message and I would like to convey my best wishes to you all.
Whether it is natural calamities, laws and order situations, whether it is handling the enemy or be it the courage to bring the youth back by wrong means, our soldiers continue to be inspired by the nation in every front of their lives.
I would like to tell you about one incident, I would like to tell you what things can inspire you to achieve success.
We have an ITBP trooper in the security forces, it is a resident of a small village in the Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The name of his village is Badha.
Our ITBP jawans went to their villages on vacations.
Therefore, Himachal Pradesh could truly become an open defecation free state.
Very few people go to those villages.
The engineering students from the city, who were far away from the village, had no toilets here.
The students of NCC, members of NSS and engineering students decided to construct toilets in the village.
All the materials, bricks, cement and other necessities for the construction of toilets have been put on their shoulders and they have piped the entire day to that village.
They constructed toilets in the village by working hard and showed a small village in the remote areas of the jungle open defecation free.
That is why Kerala will soon become an open defecation free state.
Gujarat has declared that all municipal corporations and more than 150 locations are Open Defecation Free.
10 districts have been Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on 1st November and it has decided to make its state Open Defecation Free within a few months.
So far, 7 districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only a few states.
I sincerely congratulate the citizens of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for their contribution in removing the blindness of the country in the form of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and after the first scheme, they have to stop the first scheme after submitting the second scheme.
However, often no one notices these things.
Old schemes are going on, new schemes are going on, the upcoming schemes are awaited and this is going on continuously.
In our country, those households where gas is used for cooking, those households where there is electricity, those households do not need kerosene.
He has taken a major decision to free kerosene from Haryana.
I am confident that Haryana will soon become kerosene free.
Only arbitrators and arbitrators will be hit.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been a guide for all of us.
The need of the hour is to take care of the ambitions that have been created in the minds of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step simultaneously to get out of trouble.
Whatever our old thinking is, the difference between son and daughter should be eliminated in the society.
Sudha in schools is now free of cost for children and girls.
This is the opportunity to give our daughters an experience of a discriminatory India.
It is not right that after the 21st century was destroyed, darkness should have spread in the village.
In order to make such villages free of darkness at the earliest, the mission of electrifying them is going on successfully.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to 5 crore such families.
Small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, small shopkeepers, etc.
Through the campaigns like Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Accounts, many people have been freed from this evil cycle of interest.
Direct money is being deposited in the banks through Aadhaar so that they reach the beneficiaries directly.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of ordinary people from mediators and parties.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October, the birth anniversary of the great Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who dedicated his life for the unity of India.
You would be surprised to know that on 31st of December, Sardar Patel's birth anniversary is being celebrated.
Sardar Patel had spent his entire life in connecting the country and was successful in his mission and united everyone.
During the same day, Indira Gandhiji was assassinated.
We are well aware of the events that took place in the country after their death.
Sir, I want to ask you what can be done to prevent such evils
My dear countrymen, this is not just the sadness of a person.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of uniting the country.
This injustice done to Sardar ji on the birthday of that great soul who leads his life for unity is painful for all of us.
However, we need to take into account all these difficulties and we need to move forward by chanting the mantra of unity.
The unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is in many languages or in many species, it is individuals and diets, but unity in diversity is the strength of India, it is the specialty of India, it is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to protect the country from the ideas and tendencies that are spreading separatism.
It is our responsibility to make Sardar Saheb a Shreshtha Bharat that Sardar Saheb has given us an India.
The basic mantra of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The life of Sardar Saheb had begun to see the struggle of the farmers.
But Sardar Saheb took the initiative not only for struggle but also for creative work.
I pay my homage to Sardar Saheb and urge you people to remember Sardar Saheb and take a pledge of unity wherever you may be on the 31st of October.
My dear countrymen, in this series of Diwali, Kartik Purnima is a festival of light.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are guiding not only for the entire human race but also for the entire human race.
Service, Reality and Sarbat da Bhala was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Shanti Ekta and Sadbhavana were their basic mantras.
In every teachings of Guru Nanak Dev, a mission to free the society from discrimination, superstitions and evils was carried out.
Guru Nanak Dev had chosen Bhai Lalo as his co-worker when we had reached the extreme boundary of untouchables, caste systems and high-level disorders.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', just like Guru Nanak Devji, who enlightens knowledge and inspires us to discriminate and work against discrimination.
My dear countrymen, once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on this Diwali.
My best wishes to you all for fulfilling your dreams, for fulfilling your resolutions and for leading your lives in a happy and comfortable manner.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
In the recent terrorist attacks in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir, we have lost eighteen brave hearts of our country.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
They will break every such barrier and they will culminate in efforts so that they can lead a happy life of 1. 25 billion people of the country.
But the army does not speak.
Today, I would like to specially speak to the people of Kashmir.
Anti-national forces are now being recognized by the citizens of Kashmir.
And as the truth is being understood by them, they have started moving on the path of peace by separating themselves from these ideas.
Every parent feels that schools and colleges should be functioning at the earliest.
Farmers feel that the goods and fruits produced in the fields should go to the markets across India.
It seems that economic transactions should be smooth.
And, for the past few days, these transactions have started smoothly.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am sure that we can find solutions to every problem and find ways and pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
In order to maintain law and order, the government has to take some steps.
I get the opportunity to know about the attack through social media.
It provides an opportunity to understand and understand the emotions of every section of the country and it strengthens democracy.
A young man named Harsh Vardhan, who has been studying in the eleventh edition, recently gave me a different idea.
Then I made a pledge that I would do three hours of study every day.
I would like to be a citizen of the country.
Harsh Vardhan Bhai, I am glad that you can calmly think this thing at such a young age when you are growing up in the atmosphere.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would like to say that the emergence of the citizens across the country has a huge value.
It is a symbol of national consciousness.
It shows the determination to do something.
Everyone felt that something should be done and everyone felt that something should be done.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri had tried to touch this spirit of the country in a very good manner.
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan gave this mantra and inspired the common man to work for the country.
Every citizen has another way of expressing patriotism in the voices of Bombay and the gunmen, which was demonstrated by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, Mr.
Kartik has written on the Narendra Modi Pavilion that he has created his history for the Paralympics tournament, and the game he has shown is the victory of human consciousness.
Shriman Varun Viswanathan has written on the Narendra Modi Power that our talent has done a very good job and we should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only both of us, but every individual of the country has been associated with our sportspersons in the Paralympics.
Beyond sports, these paralysis and the achievements of our sportspersons have transformed the vision of humanity and the approach to the disabled.
And I cannot forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik Hine has said.
When she won the medal, she said that this medal has defeated the disability.
There is immense strength in this direction.
At this time 19 athletes participated in the Paralympics competition with the three women of our country .
In comparison to other sports, when a person with disabilities plays, his physical ability and sporting skills are greater than that.
You will be pleasantly surprised to know that our sportspersons achieved the best of todays achievements and won four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Devendra Jhajriya, who won the Gold Medal, won the Gold Medal for the second time in Bhalafek.
And he was not born disabled. He had to lose one hand because of the shock of electricity.
Just imagine, what kind of meditation has been done in life by a person who won the first gold medal in the twenty-thirteen years of age and won the second gold medal in the twenty-first year
Mariyappan Thangvelu won the Gold Medal in the Uday Yatri.
He does not live in a big city or even in a middle class Shrimant.
Twenty-twenty years of age, despite physical obstacles, he won the country a medal on the strength of determination.
Thalit Deepa Malik did the best to wield the flag.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in a high flying manner.
Very few people would be aware of the valour that these disabled people have done during the Paralympics event.
Not only this, I was surprised when I came to know that the player who won the fourth medal in the Divyangjan Games was not able to get the medal but he completed the race in less time than the player who won the gold medal in the Sabal Championships.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a convenient scheme for the Paralympics and its development in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, last week I had experienced a lot in Gujarat's Navsari.
It was an emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibir for Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan).
Gauri Shardul and Nang district had come from the remotest jungle of the country and the entire Ramayana is immersed in the form of a poem.
And I also listened to the people gathered there, when people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book and the success stories of the lives of Divyangjans were compiled in it.
This experiment was registered in the Guinness Book of World Records .
It is a matter of great pride for all of us to have a three-pronged world circuit from differently abled persons on the same day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago on October 2, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu ji.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should become a habit and every citizen should have this duty and an atmosphere of hatred for cleanliness should be created.
Now, on 2nd October, when two years have passed, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased among the 125 crore countrymen.
And I had said - One step towards cleanliness and today all of you can say that everyone has definitely tried to move forward one pool.
And that is why every person, be it a common citizen, a government office or a road, a bus station or a railway station, a school or a college, a religious place or a hospital, a small child or a senior citizen, a rural poor or a farmer woman, is contributing something for cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
I want you to move forward.
And that is why if we talk about rural India then we have constructed two crore twenty two lakh toilets, that is, nearly two and a half crore toilets.
A healthy competition has started in the states, districts and villages.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be successful in Open Defecation Free Village Campaign.
Congratulations to those who have worked for this thing and best wishes to those who are making efforts for this thing.
And I would like to urge the countrymen that we should free the country from this problem for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the health of children and for the welfare of children.
Let us move ahead with this pledge.
Especially my young friends, I would like to present a scheme for those who use this technology in a big way.
We will not only be able to know the condition of constructing toilets in our cities by phone calls in 1969, but will also be able to apply for construction of toilets.
You should take advantage of it, especially for the younger generation to take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate sector to come forward.
They should sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
He will be sent to the district as a representative of Swachh Bharat Mission.
Fertilizer Producer Companies have been asked to purchase the fertilizer produced from the waste.
The farmers who do organic farming have been asked to provide that fertilizer.
It has been stated that those who want to improve the health of our soil, those who care about the health of the soil, those who have suffered losses due to the use of chemical fertilizers should be provided this fertilizer as per the requirement.
And ShrimanAmitabhBachchanJi has been contributing immensely in this work as a good envoy.
I am inviting youngsters to start new start-ups in the field of waste to wealth and waste to wealth.
This is certainly a work to do.
A special programme Indonesian, India Sanitation Conference is being organized from 25th September to 3rd October this year.
The Ministers, the Chief Ministers, the Mayor of the cities, the Commissioners will meet together to deliberate on Swachhta and Swachhta.
What could be the technology
What could be the economic policy
How can peoples participation be achieved
How can we create employment opportunities in this
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new reports about cleanliness are continuously coming up.
Recently, I read in the newspapers that students from Gujarat Technical University went to seven villages and started awareness campaigns for toilet construction.
He himself suffered and contributed to the construction of nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Param Vir Singh, a team of Ganga swimmed from Devprayag to Gangasagar, 2800 kilometers away and gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have formulated their vision.
Every department takes 15 days to ensure cleanliness.
In October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Department of Panchayati Raj and the Department of Rural Development will jointly formulate a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And in the last two weeks of October, the Ministry of Agriculture Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and Ministry of Consumer Affairs will be organising Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective areas during 16th to 31st October.
I urge the citizens to participate in this programme wherever we are associated with it.
You must have seen that surveys related to hygiene are conducted.
Earlier, surveys were conducted in 73 cities and what was the situation of cleanliness in that city.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind in this regard.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope all of you will contribute to this.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is being celebrated.
I have been urging you to purchase Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
I would also like to tell you that there should be one thing for Khadi in your family so that Diwali can be enforced in the house of the poor.
As a citizen, can we participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan
For two hours, four hours, you take part in the cleanliness drive and I would like to tell you that take a photo of it and share it on the Narendra Modi Power.
If there is a video then share the video.
Look, our efforts will give a new strength and a new impetus to this movement across the country.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of giving a new life is different, no one should record it or not.
And the response that he received can be said to be a very inspiring event in Indias national life.
Several young, small and big institutions of our country, people from the corporate sector, students and entrepreneurs are going to celebrate the Joe of Giving Wikes in many cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
It is a mission to bring all food items and clothes together to the needy people.
Watching the sports on the faces of those poor children, he felt so happy.
I believe that we should encourage and help those youngsters in the cities where this joy of guiding is going to be celebrated.
My dear countrymen, today is the 25th of September, the birth anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyaya and today his birth centenary year is being celebrated.
Millions of workers like me have worked with the political ideology and have explained the political ideology.
He spoke of Indias root-related diplomacy, and gave support to Indias cultural traditions.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya is being celebrated today.
The principle of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' is the principle of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the interests of every person at the grassroots.
How can the fruits of development reach the poorest of the poor
He presented the Sara Economic Framework in two words: Work for every hand and water for every farm.
My dear countrymen, I have started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashami.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the way we have praised and blessed this programme during the completion of two years.
I am also grateful to All India Radio because they not only broadcast the Mann Ki Baat but also worked hard to reach out to the listeners from all the regional languages.
I am grateful to all those listeners who have written letters after Mann Ki Baat, who have laid down the doors of the government, who have shown the wrongdoings of the government, I am grateful to them for taking care of such letters and by informing the government officials that they have provided the platform to solve the problems of the people.
And that is why Mann Ki Baat is not just a fifteen-twenty-minute conversation but also an opportunity for social transformation.
There can be something more enjoyable than this for anyone.
How will a festival connecting humans with humans
And that power will be a tool of true power and then we will celebrate the festival of victory together.
Let us follow the mantra of unity.
Let us celebrate Navratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity and goodwill to take the nation to new heights. Let us celebrate the victory of Vijayadashami.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat address on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, the 29th of August is the birthday of Dhyan Chand, the magician of Hockey.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay my homage to Dhyanchand ji and also remember his contribution towards this thing.
He played an important role in winning Indias Hockey Gold in the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
Your cricketers know the name of Bradman.
My dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, there is a lot of information on MyGov or Narendra Modi.
Besides cricket, Indians are equally optimistic about sports as well as awareness.
It was a source of inspiration for me to give this message.
Sachin says, I must talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Girls have won the medals you received.
Our daughters have proved that we are not less than anyone.
One of these daughters is from Northern India, one from South India, other from East India and some from other parts of India.
Therefore, it seems as if the daughters of the entire country have taken a strange step to brighten the name of India.
My Governance Summit Thakur writes that we have been able to do better in the Olympics.
He says, "Congratulations Mr. Modi for winning two medals in Rio first.
But I want to take care of this thing as to whether our achievements were good or not
And the answer is, no
We need to reach a long distance in the field of sports.
Our parents focus on todays study.
The society also believes that sports is a waste of time.
We cannot ignore the fact that we have not been able to achieve as per our expectations.
Something has happened that the players who performed well in India, those who performed in the sports here did not show them there and only two medals were received in the medal tally.
One more thing is that even though the medals have not been received, you will find that for the first time Indian sportspersons have performed well in many sports.
Just now, see, our innovative Bindra ji was at the fourth position in Nembaji and he won the medal in a very short span of time.
The same thing happened in tennis, between Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar was eligible for the final round of the Track Field.
You will be happy to see that after 36 years, women's hockey team has reached the Olympics.
In the last 36 years, for the first time, the men's hockey team was able to reach the knockout ferry.
Our team is strong and it is a part of pride that Argentina - whoever won the gold medals, had won the same match in the entire competition, who was the one who defeated them
Some sportspersons had a good performance, like Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das...
My countrymen, we have to do a lot of things but if we continue to do something and do something then we will get disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
This committee of the Government of India will conduct a thorough study and examine what is being done about sports in the world.
The committee will formulate a roadmap on what we can do.
We have to evolve a vision for 2020, 2024, 2028.
I also urge the state governments to set up such committees, to think about what we can do in the field of sports, what each state can do, states should choose one or two sports and how much strength we can show in that game.
We will prepare ourselves and I am confident that we will achieve the best conditions in the field of sports.
We have to move forward with this resolution.
Deshbandhan, 5th September Teachers Day
For a few years, on the occasion of Teachers Day, I have been spending time with the students.
I was learning a lot from these students too.
For me, 5th September was Teachers' Day and Education Day.
And that is why I feel like expressing my feelings in this regard...
The place where Mother is in life is also the place of teachers.
I have seen such teachers who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
They lead their lives for their disciples, students.
Currently, after the Rio Olympics, there is talk of Pullela Gopichand.
They are not only sportspersons but also an example of how excellent teachers are.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in the lives of all of us.
5th September is the birth anniversary of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the former President of India and the entire nation considers this day as Teachers Day.
Even if he had reached any place in his life, he tried to live in the field of a teacher himself.
Its so beautiful that I write it in hand and my own letter is very bad.
And that is why there was a good handwriting in my mind.
If you have a photo with your teachers on the Narendra Modi pavilion, if you have a good memory, if you have a motivational thing then you must share it.
Keep in mind that it will be valuable for you to see the contribution of teachers from the point of view of students.
Brothers and sisters, Ganesh Festival will take place in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a disruptor and all of us feel that our country, our society, our family, every individual, their lives should be seamless.
When we think of the Ganesh Festival, it is natural for us to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of Ganesh Festival is that of Lokmanya Tilak.
The formulation of programmes should be such that the society should get a new inspiration, new zeal and the self-governance given by them is my birth right and I will achieve that mantra.
Today, not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India, Ganesh Festival has started.
Public issues are discussed, essay competitions, queue competitions are held.
It touches social topics with artistic tactics.
Lokmanya Tilak has given us the mantra of 'Swaraj' and 'Swaraj'.
Whether we cannot convey the message of Suraj or of Ganesh Utsav that Suraj is our priority
I am inviting you.
It is true that festivals are the strength of the society.
Festivals bring newness to the individual and the society.
Life is impossible without festivals but it is expected to change as per the demands of time.
This time I have noticed that some people, especially Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja have written a lot about them and they are concerned about the environment.
The idols made from PoP are not environment friendly.
This pain has been severely expressed by others as they have done.
I pray to all of you that you should use the idols of Ganesha and Durga Mata as ancient times and not follow your old traditions.
Conservation of the environment, conservation of our river lake, protection of the lives of those who were left out of pollution, is in a way a service to God.
I don't know what kind of emotions we will take these issues of mine but I don't tell them alone, but this is the belief of many.
According to some, the sculptor of Pune, Abhijit Dhondfal, the founder of Kolhapur, Nisarg Mitra, science adviser
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
Durga Puja has a lot of time.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be honored with the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud when Mother Teresa gets the title of Saint who has served the poor people of India throughout her life.
The event will be held on 4th September, wherein a delegation of officers led by the Government of India and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a peoples movement, there is a big change.
Manpower is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, has successfully tried to bring people together for clean Ganga and Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, the village heads of Ganga coast were invited to Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to all those chiefs who came from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand and West Bengal for coming here for this resolution.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this idea.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a definite step in the cleanliness drive of Ganga by bringing together the peoples power.
Somebody wrote from English and somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh that there should be a toilet in our house.
He urged them to build toilets.
Some kids wrote that this year my birthday will not be celebrated but definitely make toilets.
These children of seven to seventy years have done this thing.
And the emotional impact was such that on the second day we went to school and the parents wrote a letter to the teachers and there was a assurance that we will construct toilets in the house till the date of Amook.
Congratulations to all those students who have tried for this thing and specially congratulated the parents for their efforts. They decided to construct toilets with their childrens letters seriously.
A sixteen year old girl Mallama from this district called Satyagraha against her family.
Look at the specialty of these village heads Mohammad Shafi
He deposited eighteen thousand rupees and built a toilet within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has been the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have this resolution.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, everybody is connected in that form or not, everybody contributes something or the other.
There are reports everyday - what are they trying to do
The Government of India took the idea and urged the people to make a two-three-minute cleanliness film and send it to the Government of India.
I would like to tell the TV channels that we should also make such competitions.
The imagination of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness drive.
I invite my countrymen, I have always wanted India to have relations with neighbouring countries.
However, this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We are well aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are today associated with the same cultural tradition.
They will interact with each other and exchange ideas and enjoy AIR.
All India Radio has contributed a lot to people-to-people contacts.
The Channel was inaugurated by the President.
Thanks to Bangladesh for working with us for this programme.
I convey my best wishes to all the friends of All India Radio that they are contributing to the foreign policy too.
My dear countrymen, we have assigned smoke to me as Prime Minister but in the end I am a person like you.
Sometimes an emotional event touches me a lot.
Some such emotional events inspire and inspire the people of India to do something or the other.
He wrote to me a 84-year-old mother-G is a retired teacher.
Even though I was told that I should not announce my name, I feel like telling me his name.
In a letter, he said that we had requested to give up the gas subsidy, we gave up the subsidy and later I forgot it.
However, a few days ago someone of ours came and gave me a letter and thanked me for the Give it up.
For me, this letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than Padma Shri.
Friends, I have tried to give a letter to those who left the subsidy on cooking gas.
It is my endeavor to give letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of smoke and I am a retired teacher and I will be a young man in a few years.
I am sending a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that the poor mothers can be saved from the smoke of smoke.
We are aware of the fact that when a mother who gives 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers for gas connections, the question is not about fifty thousand rupees.
This is the blessings of millions and millions of mothers and sisters that strengthen my faith in the future of our country.
He did not write this letter to me as the Prime Minister, but wrote a simple letter: Modi Bhai
There have been frequent flood situations in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local bodies and social institutions have done as much as possible by the citizens.
In August 2016, all the political parties, including the opposition parties, and the non-profit parties, agreed to the GST Bill.
Its credit goes to all political parties and if all parties start moving together then this is an example of how big it was.
Thus, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together put together a voice issue.
Those people who try to develop this kind of compassion by moving ahead with these small children, they will sometimes have to answer this thing to the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is big, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen the unity and the future of the country will be brightened.
I have full faith in the power of 1. 25 billion people.
This morning, I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for some time. And I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports in the entire country will paint every youngster with enthusiasm and hope.
You all are aware that in a few days, a big sports event will take place all over the world.
Rio is going to add a new name to our ears.
125 crore people of the country have a lot of hopes and hopes but the sportspersons who have gone out in Rio have accomplished their self-confidence.
We should do something or the other to encourage our sportspersons from wherever we may be in the coming days.
The sportsperson who reaches the Olympics reaches there only after working hard.
This is a kind of penance.
Winning and losing is important, but at the same time, it is even more important to reach that game. And that is why we convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons of our country for the Rio Olympics.
Today, I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poem lover - Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University, has sent a poem.
There will be many of you poets who have written poems, maybe they will write poems, some will make those words, they will do that in every language but the poem that Suraj has sent me is sharing with you.
I am reminded of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam ji.
The whole country and the world paid homage to him but when the name of Abdul Kalamji comes, the words of science, technology, missiles come forward and the pictures of a prosperous India come forward. And therefore, Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realise the dream of Abdul Kalam ji
You say that Ankitji is right
And if we want to go with him or we have to move ahead with him then we should do research and innovation and both these things are the souls of technology.
If research and innovation are not there then technology becomes a burden just as water stinks create odour.
If we live without research and innovation in the backdrop of old technologies then the government has taken a few steps to create the sweetness of science, innovation and innovation in the new generation so that it becomes time-bound in the changing world.
And when I say Let us aim to innovate then it means my AIM.
10 lakh will be given to those schools where such tinkering labs will be constructed and Rs. 10 lakh will be given to them to take care of them for five years.
On the other hand, India is facing many problems.
We see problems and difficulties in everyday life.
Now we have to find technological solutions.
We have called upon the young generation of the country through Atal Grand Challenges to explore, research, innovate and take it to us.
I am glad that the Government of India is giving you special awards to the researched technology on the problems and difficulties and I am glad that people are fond of it when we talked about Tinkering Labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, My mother used to worry about the drought. These days we are enjoying the joy of rain and floods are also being reported.
The State Government and the Central Government are working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to help the affected people.
Due to the rains, everybody feels happy, everybody feels happy, because the focus of our entire economic tide is rains and the agriculture that follows it.
Sometimes this kind of disease occurs that we have to repent throughout our life .
However, if we remain aware, alert and striving hard then the ways to prevent them are easier.
V. but we are sometimes a little disturbed in terms of action.
The government, the hospital, the doctors will certainly do their job but I urge you all to be cautious about not entering into our houses, our departments and our families so that there is no disease in the water.
Dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention to another crisis.
Today, life has become very fast. We dont have time to think about ourselves because of our continuous rush.
If the patient falls sick then he feels that he is recovering at the earliest and for that he is taking antibiotics.
We should not walk through shortcut .
Please complete the course of those pills.
Even if it is left incomplete, it will benefit the bacteria, it will benefit the bacteria even if they have taken more than required hence the course of taking pills has been decided in the number of days.
It is necessary to fulfil it but it is necessary to complete the course.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic resistance, it should be followed by the rules and regulations of using antibiotics.
In the last decade, there has been a decline in the mortality rate of mothers but even today, the lives of pregnant mothers are not able to survive in a very big way.
Decrease in the amount of blood during pregnancy , infection during delivery , high blood pressure , unknowingly anybody lose his life .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign called Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Through this campaign on the ninth of every month on the 9th of every month the government health center of pregnant women will be inspected free of cost .
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I appealed to gynecologists whether you cannot provide free services to the poor mothers on the 9th of this month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not give 12 days of a year to the poor
There are thousands of such doctors, they accepted my request and wrote the same letters as they did.
There are thousands of such doctors who have believed in me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective way in the country and the world.
Spectacular Policy says Nasti Bali Anushadhan There is no plant which does not have medicinal properties.
The trees that donate trees are preserved in the world as well as in the world.
However, even today there are some people who follow these ideals and bring them into practice.
In the discipline of Mahabharata, it has been said that even in the trees world, the responsibility of the child is fulfilled, as if Sonal has taken the responsibility not only to his parents but also to fulfill the wishes of the entire society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, married his grandson Sonal in a different motivational way.
The temples should start the tradition of planting plants in the rainy season.
Plantation can easily become a mass movement.
I constantly tell the farmers that we damage the land due to damaging the edges of our farms. Can we do timber farming instead of dams
Today, in order to build houses and to make wooden goods in India, a building worth crores of rupees has to be brought from abroad.
If we plant such trees on our farms that are useful for the goods and the households, after fifteen-twenty years we can sell them by the permission of the government, we can provide them with new means of income and we can save India from importing wood.
In the last few days, several states have been expedited using the weather conditions. The Government of India has recently passed a CAMPA Act and more than Rs.
I was told that the Government of Maharashtra had planted 125 crore trees in the entire state on 1st July and had pledged to plant three crore trees next year.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Maru-Bhumi have done a big one festival and we have resolved to plant twenty five lakh trees.
25 lakh trees are not a small thing in Rajasthan.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they can know that they have taken a lot of trouble.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase the green cover by 50 by 2029.
Railways have also started this work in the Green India Mission which has been launched by the central government.
There is a bright tradition of Suddha Forest Festival in Gujarat.
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest in Gujarat have been taken up under the Van Mahotsav and have been running a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but everyone deserves praise.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
Whenever there is a foreign tour, there are discussions about international policy trade, there are security related discussions and some MoUs.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was as if a pilgrimage.
South Africa has said that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness come to our ears then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela come to our fore.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited the Phoenix Settlement. The residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I will always remember his meeting.
Equality and Equal Opportunity is not such a mantra for any society and government.
The two ways of equality and affection lead us to a bright future.
We all hope for a better life, we want a better future for the children, the needs of everyone differ, the pioneers differ, but the roads are the same and that is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality and affection.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have demonstrated this value of life in South Africa.
Prime Minister, I am talking about artisans from Bengaluru.
A few days ago, I had read an article in the newspaper that a woman had lost her e-mail and committed suicide.
As a woman, I am deeply saddened by this.
I want to know your thoughts about this.
Everyone is aware of the fact that if you know about your mobile phones and e-mails then there are fascinating messages that you have received such a deposit, you will pay such a sum and you will get such a sum of money.
Some people are entangled with greed.
These technologies are spreading around the world.
Sometimes we also fall in love.
I believe that we should be cautious about this mission, we should be cautious. If such a false story comes, we should tell our friends, we should make them aware.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to meet several people during the current session of Parliament.
Our parliamentarians bring people from their respective departments, they talk about them, they tell them about their problems.
But I have had a pleasant experience these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The enthusiasm of the sons and daughters was to be seen, they had brought a big album with themselves.
Artificial paintings are drawn and painted at the station.
You must visit Aligarh and see this station for sure.
This is an example of how peoples participation brings about a change.
Thanks to all those who have worked like this in the country, special greetings to my colleagues from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, there is a season of festivals in our country along with the rainy season.
Festivals are held in temples and pilgrimage centres.
You are also connected to these festivals at home and outside the house.
Raksha Bandhan is a special festival of our links.
Like last year, couldn't we give our mothers and sisters the Raksha Bandhan a gift of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
Just imagine, let us make a visit to the sister so that her life can be safeguarded.
Moreover, you can also offer Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan to the women who are cooking food in their homes, who are cleaning their houses, who are the daughters of poor mothers.
My dear countrymen, there are many of you who were born after independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country who was born in independent India.
The 75th year of independence and the 70th year of India's independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal and hope. This can be an opportunity for the country's resolve to do something.
Freedom Festival is not a government programme but it should be done by the people of the country.
It should be our festival like Diwali.
I hope that we too will do something good to connect with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort on 15th August.
And if you have something in your mind, if you have such a desire then that thing should be depicted from the Red Fort.
As a representative of yours, as a Prime Servant, you must send me from the Red Fort and give me some suggestions and suggestions.
I invite you all to remember the brave hearts who laid down their lives for freedom, to remember the great men who laid down their lives for India and to move ahead with a pledge to do something for the country.
Once again I have got the opportunity to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
For me, Mann Ki Baat is not a ritual.
I am eager to talk to you myself.
And I am glad that I can reach every corner of the country through Mann Ki Baat.
I thank All India Radio for the successful efforts made by All India Radio to translate Mann Ki Baat into regional languages at 8 pm.
And I am glad that the people who listen to my Mann Ki Baat programme, after the programme, reach out to me through telephone and through MyGov website and through the Narendra Modi App.
Your suggestions are useful for me while running the government.
How active should governance be for the welfare of the people
How much priority should be given to the welfare of the people
For this, my interaction with you is very important.
5th June is World Environment Day.
Environmental issues are discussed and carefully discussed around the world.
The main theme of the World Environment Day is Ero Tolerance for Illigerent Wildlife Trade (EWTT) which has been decided by the United Nations.
The reason for this is that you must have seen that in the jungles near the Himalayan foothills of Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir, there was a recent harvest.
Therefore, saving the forests and saving the water becomes the responsibility of all of us.
He had a two-and-a-half hour interaction with the Chief Ministers of every state.
Barkai heard what he had to say.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have used technology in a big way.
We need to take these successful steps taken by the State Governments to other states of the country through NITI Aayog.
Public participation becomes the main reason for success in tackling such problems.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important.
And that is why Drop More Crop - More production, Micro Irrigation, Micro Irrigation, Micro Irrigation
In many states, sugarcane farmers are now using micro-irrigation and micro-irrigation and some are using Tushar irrigation.
I have also learnt from them that there are major targets in many states, especially Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, which have done a great job in terms of magnificent irrigation.
Their effort is to bring 2-3 lakh hectares of land under micro irrigation every year.
This campaign will not only benefit the agriculture but will also increase the water conservation in all the states.
Our bonded mission Bhagirathi in Telangana has tried to harness the waters of the rivers Godavari and Krishna in a better way.
Efforts are being made to replenish groundwater with the help of technologies through the Sustainable Progress Mission in Andhra Pradesh.
In the peoples movement in Maharashtra, people are providing financial assistance along with Shramdaan.
I am sure that the Jalakt Shivar Abhiyan will actually be useful in protecting Maharashtra from future water conservation.
The State of Chhattisgarh has undertaken a massive state-of-the-art drive.
A massive campaign has been launched to revive the neighbourhoods of Rajasthan and Gujarat in the form of a Jal Mandir, where the neighbourhoods of ancient times are present.
However, there is a shortage of water in some parts of that state.
A big work is being done by constructing checkhams and small bundles there.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is plenty of water therefore we stayed in vain and on the end of monsoon there is no water therefore how will it work if we stay in trouble .
And water is not limited to farmers alone.
This is related to the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the decent and the poor.
Therefore, water should be our priority and when we celebrate Diwali this year, how much water has been saved during this rainy season
You will see that our joy will increase manifold.
And this is not just the government, it is the political leader but it is the work of the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
Our India is about to be transparent.
Those who are going to take India from one end to the other in a similar manner.
We will have to change our old habits to do this.
Today, I would like to touch upon such a topic that if we help me in that matter then we can go to that direction successfully.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards a cashless society.
Electronic technology can help us earn money and send money.
Your fear of stealing your pockets is not there, it is not anxiety to keep your pockets fit.
So it'll be automatically registered.
Using this method will be a bit difficult in the beginning but once the habits are adopted, this system will become easier.
This is possible because the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country have been opened in the last few days under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
On the other hand, Aadhaar number was also received and mobile phones are now in the hands of almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhaar-Mobile-JAM (JDM) has been launched.
We can move forward in the direction of cashless society by coordinating with GST.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with the Jan Dhan bank.
In the coming days, it will be useful for both card credit and debit.
And a small machine has also been made available to the PSUs.
O
It is called the Point of Cell, through this instrument you can lend money to others using Aadhaar number, RuPay card.
One of the initiatives undertaken by the Government of India is how to provide money through POS.
The second initiative we have taken is the Bank on Mobile.
It will be very easy to exchange money through your mobile phones.
In a way, this is the step taken by the bank in this direction.
Work is underway to provide banking services to the post offices.
If we learn to use this method in practice, if we make it a habit then there is no need for direct movement and there is no need to take the money in the pocket.
Businesses will be automatically transparent and transparent.
The two-digit transactions will be closed.
The impact of timelines will also be reduced.
Therefore, I would urge my countrymen to start this thing.
You see, once this system has started, we should move forward in a comfortable manner.
Twenty years ago, had anyone ever thought that such a mobile phone would be in our hands
Gradually it becomes a habit now it is not possible to stay without it .
It is possible that cashless society can be gradually shaped.
However, it will be better if it comes to the notice in a short time.
Our sportspersons participating in the Rio Olympics should be encouraged and their confidence should be enhanced.
He was the Chief Ministerial candidate.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India.
Do they get nutritious food according to requirement or not
Whether the trainers who should be trained for their physical well-being or not .
I am happy to see that be it the result of elections or be it the possibility of renewing the responsibilities as the Chief Minister or be it my colleagues in such a scenario, they are so awake to their work as sports minister.
When our sportspersons believe that the 125 crore Indians are standing with us then this power gives a big boost and their self-confidence reiterates.
Recently, I had referred to the topic of FIFA Under Saventin World Cup.
I have received information about it from all over the country and during this period I can see that the atmosphere of football has started spreading across the country.
Many people are taking initiatives and forming their own teams.
I have received several suggestions on the Narendra Modi Power.
It is possible that many of them would not be playing but I had a pleasant experience of sports in the hearts of thousands of youth of the country.
You are familiar with the relationship between cricket and India but I have seen how much interest in football is so much.
Everything should not be measured in terms of victory and defeat.
With sportspersonship, India should make its mark in the world.
I urge my countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm for our sportspersons.
New solutions are coming from somewhere or the other for the last eight-two days.
I am not talking about election results. I am talking about those students who have studied and examined throughout the year.
It is now clear that the results of the tenth grade are coming together and our daughters are singing valour.
Its a matter of happiness.
We must move forward with confidence.
However, I have come up with a new kind of question and I have never thought about it.
I felt immensely distressed by reading this.
He says that when I went home after getting 89. 33 marks, I realized that I would be grateful all around, there would be a rain of congratulations but as soon as I was told to the household that if I had got 4 times more then it would have been 90.
But I feel stiff in my mind.
I have read your letter Barkai. I believe that this pain can not be yours alone but millions and millions of students like you.
Because it is the environment that has been created to find errors rather than to enjoy the joy.
This is the second form of negativity.
I would like to urge the people of the neighborhood to welcome and accept the results that your children bring.
Otherwise, a day will come when you will get 100 percent of the marks. And even then someone will say that it is true that you have got 100 percent of the quality but if you have done it then it would have been better.
Therefore, it is necessary for every thing to have a limitation.
Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written a similar letter.
He says that people close to him are not ready to accept his fate.
They say that something more could have been done and something could have been done better.
I would like to tell you that in such a situation do not let yourself balance.
Everyone expresses hope and listens.
Stay firm on your resolve and try to do something better.
However, if we don't find satisfaction in what we have received, we will never be able to create new things.
And that is why I would urge you to sing the songs of success that has been achieved.
Those who do not get good qualities in the perimeter go ahead in sports, move forward in the field of music, move forward in the region of Kalakusari, move forward in the business.
God has given everyone some skills.
Just imagine your inner strength, focus on it, you will make progress in your life.
There was a time when the Saint Vadodara was an integral part of the folk music of the Kashmir Valley.
However, Pandit Shivakumar, who handled it and today became an important player in the field of global music.
In the Indian music field, Sanai was a limited play.
During the times of kings and emperors there was a place of Sai at the entrance of Darbar.
But Ustad Bismilla Khan took over this dress and kept Sanai at this height of one of the best in the world.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I realize that the expenditure on medicines in the poor families of our country is going to bring down the financial burden on those families.
And it is true that the cost of not lying sick is very low but after falling sick one can get healthy again but it costs a lot.
Why shouldn't we have a lifestyle like this that we will not be able to cure the disease, we will not have to bear the financial burden on our families.
One, cleanliness is the most important way of escaping from diseases.
Who can serve the poorest of the poor then it is cleanliness.
And secondly, for which I constantly urge you, that is Yoga.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
The entire world is an attraction, a reverence for Yoga and the world has adopted it.
This is an invaluable gift that our ancestors have given us to the world.
The world suffering from depression gets the strength to lead a balanced life.
It is easy to be healthy for those associated with Yoga, to be balanced, to create a will in the mind and to concentrate on all these things.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes a collective atmosphere can bring about a change in the life of a person.
I hope you will do something about it on June 21.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we use this day on 21st June for Yoga in our lives
Can we do Yoga in our social life
I urge you not to stay behind.
It is extremely important for India to be healthy.
My dear countrymen, I am constantly connected with you through Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I had given you a mobile number and you could listen to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on it.
But now it has been made easier.
Whenever you want to listen to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call to this number, you can listen to it in that language.
Hello.
We decide to do many things during the holidays.
And during these holidays there is a season when it is considered as a joy to take the pleasure of arrogance. It also seems that if a little left wing comes in the afternoon then it will be a barrier.
But this time, the joy of being enjoyed by the scorching heat has spread all over the world.
It is natural to have an environment of care throughout the country.
And whenever there is constant drought in it, water storage stops.
Sometimes, due to encroachment, sometimes due to narrowing of roads, obstructions due to obstructions, there is less water conservation in the reservoir than its capacity.
And this thing happens year after year, the water holding capacity decreases.
Despite this, I have seen that even the citizens are making a lot of effort for this thing.
Awareness is visible in many villages and they know the true value of water only those who have faced the crisis of hurricanes.
And there is a sensitivity about water conservation and there is a sense of ability to do something about it.
Just a few days ago, I was told that the Hivare Bazar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra have handled the issue of water in a very sensitive manner.
They decided not to waste crops such as crops that have more water, husk, banana and so on.
It sounds very easy to hear but it is not as easy as it sounds.
What a big pledge would all have been made
He took initiatives in Tushar Irrigation, Dhibak Irrigation, Water Conservation and Water Supply and today this village is on the verge of cleaning up water scarcity.
I am telling you about this small village of Hivarebazar but I congratulate all the villagers and their best wishes to them.
He built about seventy-seven farms.
As a result, ground water level increased and water level improved.
He added that when crops need water, they get water and big data.
The income from farming increased by twenty percent.
Besides water conservation, water quality improves due to rising water levels.
However, many such initiatives are being taken by the citizens who never come forward.
If the government has implemented a good campaign then sometimes it gets fame but if we look around you people will find out how people try to find ways to overcome this problem through innovative ways to eliminate drought.
It is a human nature that despite all the difficulties, if we know something good then the feeling of elimination of all the troubles will emerge.
It is very likely that there will be 106 to 110 rainfall in this rainy season.
There is still time for the rains but the news of good rainfall has come up.
Can we take a mission from now on to save water in villages
Farmers need soil and it is useful for the crops.
We will not only benefit the agriculture but will also increase the capacity of water conservation in the bottom.
Our neighbours will get water.
Today there is a problem of water, there is a situation of drought, but the coming months and months are in our hands.
Their anxiety is social because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments came and several schemes were formulated so that a lot of money was spent on them.
Ganga gives us a blessing, it gives us employment, it gives us a new strength to live through the Ganges.
The way Ganga flows, it gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
A bhagirath brought us to Ganga but it requires crores of bhagiraths to save it.
This campaign will never succeed without peoples participation.
Several initiatives are being taken at the government level in this regard.
Efforts are being made to obtain cooperation from the states that are in the Gangetic region.
Efforts are being made to involve social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of the Ganges clean and to prevent industrial pollution in the Ganges water.
Everyday solid waste is supplied to the rivers and drains.
In order to clean this waste, the work of cleaning water waste waste waste in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna is done with the help of a trash skimmer.
It has been made available to all local administration agencies and urged them to use it to clean the garbage.
And I was told recently that where these efforts are being done in a better way, there are 3 tons of garbage collected every day.
That is, it is true that the dirt that is being produced on such a large scale has been prevented from rising.
In the coming days, plans have been made to set up trash skimmers at some places and people living on the banks of river Ganga and Yamuna will soon feel the same.
In order to prevent industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with the paper-lagada industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar mills.
I still feel that it will have good results.
The error of waste materials falling from the paperworks is now on the way to close down.
This is the symptom of our steps in the right direction and in a way awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that not only the people living on the banks of the Ganges but when a person visits me in the southern part of the country then he will definitely say that the Ganga will be clean.
This confidence of the common man will succeed in the cleanliness drive of Ganga.
Citizens are donating money for cleaning the Ganga.
This work is going on in an excellent manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayat Raj Diwas in India.
On this very day, the Panchayati Raj system had started in our country.
And gradually the Panchayati Raj system spread all over the country has been successfully working as an important component of our democratic governance system.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Mhow, the birthplace of Dr. Ambedkar on 14th April.
I got the opportunity to bow down to that holy land and today on 24th December I will celebrate Panchayat Raj Day in the state of Jharkhand where our tribal brothers and sisters live in large numbers.
He interacted with all Panchayats across the country at 3 pm.
This campaign has done a great job of creating awareness.
How will a democratic institution be strengthened at the village level in every corner of India
How will the village be self-reliant
In some villages, Annadaan initiatives were taken.
The kind of awareness that has come from the villages is that of India-UDAY.
Gram Uday is the basis of India-UDAY.
Therefore, we will not be able to achieve the desired results if we focus on village rise.
Shermila Gharpure called from Mumbai and expressed her concern.
I am talking from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpure.
I have a question about school and college education.
There is a need for reforms in the education sector over the last several years.
Not getting proper schools or colleges or the quality of education .
Even after completing their education, they don't know many basic things, so our children remain behind in the world.
What are our ideas about this
Today, every family has the biggest dream of mothers and sisters that is education for children.
Parents should be concerned about how to teach, educate and educate children. And I believe that the results of this awareness among the families are visible in the school.
Every government in our country has emphasized on the issue of education and every government has worked for it in its own way.
But the more important it is now, the more it is for reforms in our education system.
We have done a great job of extension.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
uality Education through literacy missions should now be our priority.
As a result, we have to keep an eye on the outcome of this scheme.
Preferences have been observed on how many children came to school today.
Now we will have to focus on providing good education and proper education to those children who have come to school.
You must have seen in this government's budget and efforts have been made to provide good education.
In this budget, we will see that 10 government universities and 10 private universities have been asked to come out of government control and come to a challenging, competitive level.
Would you like to work for the best universities
This scheme has been launched with the aim of giving them complete freedom.
At the same time, education is equally important.
For the past few days, citizens have been asking me about one issue.
He wrote on the web portal MyGov, some people write on my Narendra Modi Power, and a large number of youngsters write on it.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am addressing Mona Karnawal from Bijnor.
Along with education, sports is also important for the youth of today's times.
They should have a sense of compassion, a good leadership, which will lead to their overall development.
I would like to inspire more and more youngsters and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
One day I had come to my mind to talk to all these groups before talking to you.
And when I asked him that earlier this kind of meeting was held, his reply was that this is the first such meeting since independence.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to the youngsters and the young friends who have urged me for all these things.
A lot of work is being done at your level but if our organisations work in a collective manner, then what kind of impact can be achieved.
Now it is true that I am the cadet of NCC i. e.
I got the benefit of childhood and I also believe that there should be a new consciousness in such organizations.
In this meeting, I presented some issues to them.
We had to talk to him on a number of things.
What innovations can we innovate in the functioning and programmes of several youth organizations
If you write it on my Narendra Modi pavilion then I will go to the right place and I believe that after this meeting all these things will get a boost.
I believe that it will happen to us that we should associate ourselves with all these things.
My dear countrymen, I want to tell you one thing that you will run away to think.
I believe that this is a matter of awakening for all of us.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that what kind of gas cylinders will be provided by the party during the last several elections
And every political party used to feel that if the middle class had to go for election, then gas cylinders were an important topic.
This is a universal experience.
But it has never been considered outside this chatti.
Today, my countrymen, I am delighted to seek my blessings before you.
I chose a different path and that path was to give confidence to the masses.
Sometimes we should have more faith in our people than to believe in ourselves.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
In our country, grants were rejected when there was a right equation.
I would particularly urge all the political classes to come up with at least one thing to believe in people everywhere.
We will get the result that we have never thought of it.
We should move in this direction.
And I always feel as if I had come to my mind that why should I sign a third and fourth grade job
Believe in those who have been tested and those who have been tested and qualified.
Sometimes I feel that we should declare that there will be no ticket check posting on this single line of railways.
It comes to my mind that it cannot be a government rule but a trustworthy environment can be created.
And none of the politicians who have created this environment have created this thing.
Every breaking news on every newspaper and news channel is painful.
In this country with a population of 1. 25 billion people, dont we have anything good
Please change the situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his deep sorrow but I believe that this anger is not on me but on the situation of indignation.
You must remember that Dr. A.
I have seen that some television channels give a positive news time.
An atmosphere of positive news is being created in today's time.
Everyone feels that people should get accurate news and good news.
It is true that the biggest person, the best thing, the best words, the best words, the best way to be spoken in the best way, the positive news is more impactful than the results.
It is true that if we put more emphasis on goodness then we will not have enough space for evil.
Deep patterns will remove darkness.
And that is why you may be surprised to know that the government has started a website called Transforming India.
Not only the government but also the citizens.
And this is such a portal on which you can send a good news to yourself.
You can contribute.
Raviji, you have received good information, but please don't stay with me.
The Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh Congregation can become a center of attraction for tourists .
Very few people around the world knew that for such a long time, millions and millions of people come to the river bank.
Festival is celebrated in a peaceful , quiet atmosphere .
In order to organise such events, new benchmarks are being set up in terms of programme management and public participation.
For the past two days, I have seen that many people are uploading photos of Kumbh Mela.
I believe that the tourism department of the Government of India should compete with the tourism departments of the state government and should urge people to take out the best photos and upload them.
Not only should there be cleanliness, but those returning from there will take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that Kumbh is a religious, spiritual fair but we can transform it into a social festival.
I am glad that just like our hearts have connected our hearts with things that are unbreakable, once again many-many thanks.
Mann Ki Baat always waits for me and you too.
At this time, I have seen a lot of letters, responses, phone calls, there are many things, suggestions and inspirations. Everybody sees something or the other, you see, there is a feeling of emotion.
Yet, I would like to share your thoughts with you once again in the spirit of Mann Ki Baat.
You might recall that in the last few years, I had discussed something about Premchand ji's book and we decided to share some of the books that I read through Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me that I should talk about some more books.
But I must acknowledge that I cannot give time to save books on a very large scale.
But it has been an advantage that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of several books from whatever you send in writing.
However, from the experience of the last one month, I feel that we should take this initiative forward.
You can make a permanent copy of the books on the Narendra Modi App and when you read a new book, write it there, discuss it and you can suggest a good name for the copy of these books.
And I feel that the issue of water has moved away the minds of Indians today.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
Media has launched several innovative missions on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, they are doing something or the other on the battlefield.
The rural people have worked hard to give a definite direction to the waterfall that flows from the mountains.
And that is the pure indigenous method.
This has not only prevented the loss of soil smoke and crops but has also helped the farmers to get water.
You will be glad to know that Meghalaya, the beautiful state in the North-East, is the first state in the country to formulate its water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the crops that have less water, such crops are being encouraged and the farmers are not harmed.
Several fairs are held on the occasion of festivals.
Shouldn't these fairs be used for water conservation
People from every corner of the society go to fairs.
In these fairs, we can deliver the message of water conservation very effectively, fill exhibitions, play streets. With festivals, we can convey the message of water conservation in a very simple manner.
In fact, the World Children Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
This is an early sports event in which the youngsters who have been saved from cancer are those who have come out fighting cancer in their lives.
Football and Table Tennis competitions were organised at the event.
All these 10 winners of our country won the medal.
Some players have won more than one medal in this.
Sanjiv Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Dada, Kolkata, P.
Several people from different parts of the country have written to me on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, 2019, the vision of Space Progress has been very vibrant for India.
Our scientists had launched ASAT in March and thereafter launched Chandrayaan 2.
However, there was not much discussion on the big and important events like ASAT during the elections.
With the help of ASAT missile, we have achieved the capability of launching satellites at a distance of 300 kilometers in just three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve unprecedented success and now, on 22nd July, the entire country is proud to have taken steps in space from Chandrayaan 2 to Sriharikota.
The photographs of the Chandrayaan 2 flight filled the country with honour and zeal and joy.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-2 will further clarify our understanding of the Moon.
With this, we can get more detailed information about the moon but if you ask me what two big things I have learnt from Chandrayaan 2 then I will tell you, these two things are Feath and Firelessness means faith and fearlessness.
We must have faith in our talent and capabilities, trust in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
It is Indian in both the heart and the attitude.
The entire Swadeshi is a campaign.
When there was talk of innovative zeal and innovative zeal in new areas then our scientists are superior and world class, this campaign has once again proved it.
The second important factor is that there is no need to fear any crisis.
This work is unprecedented in the manner in which our scientists, in record time, in the day of night, have solved all the technological questions in the Chandrayaan-2 space.
The world has witnessed this great penance of scientists.
It should be a matter of pride for all of us and we are surprised to see that the time has not changed due to the difficulties.
We often have to face temporary difficulties in life but we always have the power to overcome them.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 mission will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
In the end, science is the path of development.
Now, we are awaiting the jurisdiction of September when lander-wire and rover technologies will land on the lunar surface.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the students of the country, young friends, young colleagues and the youth of the country by informing them about a very entertaining competition - a quiz competition.
I urge my young friends and students to participate in this quiz competition and make our participation, competition more entertaining and unforgettable.
I specially urge the school, the parents, the enthusiastic headmasters and the teachers to work hard to conquer their schools.
The most thrilling thing is that the government of India will take the highest quality students from every state to Sriharikota and in September they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when the moon will land on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event for these victorious students. You will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to gain maximum merit and you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have done an inspection.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the cleanliness drive from time to time and has always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting new benchmarks of cleanliness with the participation of several people.
We have achieved an ideal situation in terms of cleanliness but the way we have achieved success in terms of cleanliness from Open Defecation Free (ODF) villages to public places, it is the strength of the resolve of one hundred thirty crore countrymen, but we will not stop here.
This campaign is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Yogesh Sainik and his team in the media.
Yogesh Sainik is an engineer and has left his job in the United States and returned to India to serve Mother India.
Some time ago, he took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but also beautiful.
With his team he started from the garbage of Lodhi Garden .
Beautiful paintings have been provided to many parts of Delhi through street arts.
He started showing his art from the walls of overbridge and school to the slums and people also got support from him.
You might remember that during the Kumbh Mela, Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings.
I understand that Yoga Sainik and his team had played a very big role in it too.
Even the colours and fibres cannot be heard, however, the message of the rainbow that is produced from the pictures is more effective than thousands of words and we also experience the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to develop a culture of waste to wealth in our society.
We have to move forward in the direction of making gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very entertaining response to MyGov.
This was the reaction of Bhai Mahmoud Aslam, a resident of Shapian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, I like listening to Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to say that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobilization Programme in Jammu and Kashmir in my state.
At the same time, there should be an online monitoring system for the programme.
I believe that this was the first such programme in which people had a direct interaction with the government.
Brother Mahmoud Aslam ji sent me this message and after reading it my eagerness to know about the bank to village programme increased and when I got a detailed account of it, the entire country should know about it.
The people of Kashmir are keen to connect with the mainstream of development and how enthusiastic they are.
Literacy, sex quality, health, hygiene, water conservation, electricity, water, grassroots education, and senior citizens.
Friends, This programme was not just a formality of the government but the officers returned to the village throughout the day but during this time the officers did a two-day work in Panchayat and they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
Under Khelo India, children were sportspersons.
Sports literature, job cards of MNREGA and certificates of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir participated openly in this festival of development.
It is heartening to note that the Bank to Village programme was organised in such far-flung areas to reach where government officials had to pave the way for a day or a day or a half and a half.
The officers also went to border panchayats where there is constant fear of cross-border firing, and officers are also fearless in the highly sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officers were so much welcomed that they stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is extremely pleasant to see a large number of people participating in the Gram Sabhas in these areas and to prepare plans for themselves.
It is also evident that people are watching evils in the path of development, they are steadfastly striving to ensure that they cannot succeed in their domestic goals.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, the recipient of the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he has said, "Wodige Madige Agyed Margya, the land of semi-desert, the land of semi-desert, the bonds of rain and streams of water are intact and the earth is enchanted by its beauty.
Throughout India, people of different cultures and languages celebrate Shravan month as their own methods.
In this situation, when we look around, it seems as if the earth has made a shawl of greenery.
Everywhere a new energy is created.
In this holy month, many devotees visit Kavad and Amarnath Yatra, while some regularly fast and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagapanchami.
During this period, the festival of Rakhi Purnima, a symbol of love of brothers and sisters, is also celebrated.
You will be happy to know that the most emotional participants have participated in the Amarnath Yatra for the last four years.
Since July 1, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the devotees who participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, the devotees have participated in it in just 28 days.
I particularly appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey carry the feelings of love and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in one and a half months since the Chardham Yatra started in Uttarakhand this year.
For the first time, a record number of pilgrims have reached there after the 2013 earthquake.
I appeal to all of you that you must go to those areas where the natural beauty was visible during Mansoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage is not a big teacher.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and auspicious month of Shravan will bring a new energy, new hope and new energy to you all.
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of the uit India Movement.
I would like you to make some special preparations for the 15th of August and find a new way to celebrate this festival of Independence.
When we watch TV, we get to see only one aspect of the monsoon - water on all sides, transport congestion, joy in other pictures of Mansoon, our farmers, migratory birds, flowing waterfalls, shallow land on all sides.
Rain, freshness and joy, freshness and freshness both bring freshness and happiness with you.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stop, there is a lot of difficulty but there is a limit of time.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, you will be busy in exams.
Today, you are often awaiting the war between India and Australia.
India has fought against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The time has come for a new revolution in the world of sports.
And you can see that the atmosphere of football, hockey, tennis and clothing is being created in India just like cricket.
Perhaps you would have come to know that India is hosting the FIFA World Football Championship next year in 2017.
Twenty-four confederations from across the globe will come to India.
And on the other hand, I see that the attraction of football is increasing among the youth, be it EPL, Spanish League or Indian Superlig.
Young friends take time to know about these conflicts, to watch them on a face-to-face television.
How will there be a competition between governance, educational institutions and social organisations to connect themselves with sports
We see that all this has happened in terms of cricket.
But we have to create this environment in terms of other sports.
This is a golden jubilee for India.
My dear students, you must have decided on tourism during these holidays.
And I noticed that the work that we did not get to our tourism department, our cultural department was not possible, the state governments were not able to do it and the government of India was not able to do it, crores of tourists of the country did it.
India is full of diversity.
Perhaps there is not a single district in India where I have not visited.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
And I am glad that nearly ten thousand people have visited the coal mines of Sawaner near Nagpur as tourists.
There are some attempts being made by both the tourists and tourists.
All efforts are being made but not of a scientific method.
Would you like to pay special attention to this
I am sure my young friends will help me in this work.
The tourism sector is expected to generate massive employment.
India is far behind in terms of tourism as compared to the world .
But if we decide to focus on tourism then we can attract the world towards India.
The biggest heritage of the tourism sector of the world can attract our country and create employment opportunities for millions and millions of youth of our country.
Whether it is governance, institutions, societies or citizens, all of us have to do this together.
Let us strive towards this thing.
My young friends, the bets have come and I don't think that something like this has happened.
If you are not able to swim, you decide to learn to swim in these beds.
If you are not able to drive a bicycle, you cannot drive a bicycle in these bets.
Even today, while typing on computers, I do with two fingers. Why shouldn't I learn to do clean typing
There are many skills for our personality development.
You will see that after the start of the school after the vacation, after the start of the college, you will go back to that place and tell your friend that Dasta, I have learnt this vacation, if I have not learnt anything then he will say.
My time was over but you have learnt new things.
Friends, there will be mutual discussions on this.
Many suggestions have been received on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji.
In the last holidays of the summer we had told that those spots also have sunlight , for this keep a bottle of water filled in a bottle on your balcony or glass for snacks .
I did the same and I was glad to tell you that it was my friendship with Chimanyas.
He called me and reminded me of a charming work .
I remember the last time and I had said that during the summer season, water should be filled in the earthen pots for the birds.
The actress told me that she does this throughout the year and she has been friends with many people.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi literature, had a lot of love for the birds.
He had written in his poem, "Do not let you go away, fill the courtyard with charity and fill the hood with hum salt and sweet cool."
Let us also do this thing that Mahadevi ji has said.
I congratulate and thank you for taking into consideration a very important issue.
Have we ever given them water in summer days
I express my gratitude to you all for the craftsmanship and for the sensitivity of you people in a very simple manner.
Yes, this is the habit of India.
But I express my gratitude to you people for seeing the sculpture.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, You must have heard a lot about Digital India and Digital India.
Some people believe that Digital India is the world of the youth of the city.
But it is not like that.
You will be happy to know that a Kisan Suvidha App has been prepared for your service.
If we download the Kisan Suvidha App in our mobile phones then we will be able to handle a lot of information about agriculture and climate.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download these facilities on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, For others, summer is the time of vacation but summer is the time for farmers to sweat.
He awaits rain.
The period prior to the start of the direct farming season is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think about what will happen to us by water.
The water flowing drains, the water flowing drains, the path of water flow in the ponds, where some waste is stored or some encroachment occurs, the water flow stops and as a result the water conservation gradually decreases.
In the first rain, the water was saved, the ponds were filled, the rivers were filled, then even if there was no rains then there would be less damage.
You must have seen that we have decided to construct five lakh farms.
Emphasis has been laid on water conservation through MNREGA.
There will be many such villages across the country, how many progressive farmers, how many people will be aware of this thing.
However, there is a need to do more today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you one more thing today that the Government of India had recently organised a grand exhibition on agriculture.
I have seen how modern technology has been developed in it.
However, it remains to be finished directly from the fields.
Fertilizers should be used as less as farmers.
This mantra should be followed, our agriculture sector should move forward using scientific methods.
I hope that we will complete the task of water conservation in the next one or two months.
My dear countrymen, 7th April is World Health Day.
Victory on Diabetes is the announcement of World Health Day this year.
It is said that in 2014, the institution of diabetes patients in India was about 1. 5 crore.
Diabetes occurred due to 3 of deaths due to deaths.
As the entire world is concerned about diabetes, the theme of the World Health Day is Victory to Diabetes on 7th April.
We all know that our lifestyle is the main cause of type 2 diabetes .
If you like yoga, then do yoga.
Otherwise do minimum walking , running , exercise .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We are sometimes hesitant to conduct health check-ups.
And because of a lot of deterioration, we can see that diabetes has already shrinked in our body.
This means that it is such a disease which can be detected promptly.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
I would like to urge you all to eradicate tuberculosis or diabetes.
And that is why I urge all the countrymen to get rid of TB in order to overcome diabetes.
Babasaheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary, particularly on 14th April.
His 150th Birth Anniversary was celebrated across the country.
A Panchteerth - his birthplace in Mhow.
Landon, where he took higher education, Nagpur, where he learnt.
I am fortunate to visit Mhow at the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become a better citizen.
We can pay homage to him by following the path shown by him, by being a good citizen.
In the last few days, Vikram Samvatsar will start and a new record process will start.
It is celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
Just a missed call.
You make a missed call according to your convenience.
If you want to listen to the previous programme of Mann Ki Baat then you can listen to it and listen to it in your language.
I would be happy to be with you through this.
My dear countrymen, many congratulations to you all.
How can this World Cup enhance the interest of sports among the youth of India
We should also participate in this.
He sent photographs of some such places and uploaded Photo that he was really happy to see them.
If you want to see something like hobby-e-dedar hai agar, then you should first look at it.
He should have a desire to reach wherever no one has gone before.
Western Coal Fields Limited, Sawaner site near Nagpur, has coal mines.
When people visit tourist places then they buy something or the other.
Even if he is poor, he will take something and if he is a lord, he will spend more.
I am asking you a question before me.
Would you like to imbibe a new art in these bets, a skill in our personality for achieving something new
Why not increase your strength
Do you like paintings , but don't you
If you start, you will start.
Definitely use vacations for personality development, for learning new arts and for increasing skills.
There are countless sectors.
The craftsman Kuke of Mysore has presented a sensitive issue to all of us.
If you ask him a question then he answers it and explains it to us.
And once you use it, see what is your use in it
And if you feel something like this then you should complain to me about it.
We should save water in villages and villages.
How can we save the drops of water in the coming rains
How can the water of the village remain in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have sickened our landscape due to excessive use of fertilizers.
But if we use the best examples of bamboo then would we like to eat food
You will not like that food.
But today we have become ineffective in terms of TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to my Mann Ki Baat on radio.
Now the ideas of exams will start in your minds.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I believe that the more you care about your children's exams, the more you feel.
But if we change our vision of exams then we can be free of anxiety.
I had told you in the background of my Mann Ki Baat programme that send me your experiences and suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
I am glad that the teachers, the students who have achieved great success in their lives, and the beneficiaries of the society have written a lot on this page and sent it to me.
Today, I want to talk to the parents, students and teachers in my mind about the programme.
I will tell you something about what I have heard, what I have read, what I have read and what I have been told, I will tell myself what I feel.
But I am confident that this 25-30 minute interaction will certainly be beneficial for the students who are going to face the examination.
My dear student friends, before I talk to you, todays Mann Ki Baat has been started by a well-known opener in the world.
You will surely find their experiences useful.
I know that the examinations will start in a few days.
Some of you will be under stress.
I have only one message.
You, your parents will expect you, keep your teachers, keep other members of your family and keep your friends.
Wherever you go, how is your preparation going on
How much quantity will you get
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
In the last 24 years there have been several difficult moments and several good moments have also come.
However, the expectations of the people were always there and as the time progressed, the expectations also grew.
And I needed to find a solution for that.
Then I thought that I myself had hoped for myself and had set my own goals.
My focus was on conduciveness and then all the goals were achieved by you.
Friends, what was Tendulkar saying
Do not sink beneath the expectations.
Your future needs to be shaped.
Why should you spend your time in competing with others
You will see that no one can stop you from moving ahead and you will achieve even greater success than what you have achieved before then you will not need to depend on others for enjoying happiness.
You will experience self-sacrifice.
Friends, Do not consider examination as a game of qualities and statistics.
Where did you go, how much did you get
Or don't stumble.
This is known through these tests, is our speed right
And that is why if your dream is immense, it will be a festival of joy on its own.
And that is why what will happen this year
Do not keep yourself limited at all .
Walk ahead with a magnificent goal and even if there is lesser success than expected, it will not be disappointed. It will get inspired to work even more with greater zeal.
Thousands of citizens have written small issues on my pages and their mobile phones.
In fact, the entire year, 365 days, should be compatible with our daily routine, our dreams and ideas.
Shriman Prabhakar Reddy took a dig at Mandela and slept on time and wrote in his urge to illuminate the study early in the morning.
Prabhakar Reddy says that the entrance papers and other essential items should be delivered to the examination centre in time.
Perhaps I did not have the courage to say this because I am not serious about sleeping.
And there is a complaint of many of my friends that I do not take enough sleep.
During the examination, I talk about sleeping so that you can examine in a stress-free condition.
Whether you do this or not .
I am sure you will not.
Being disciplined in life is a vital reason for being strong the foundation of success.
Not only this, daily routine also worsens.
And that is why do not understand anything small or small.
Decide, do it.
The negative impact of those tensions that are beneath them is on their outcome.
And on the basis of the study I have done, those who go with confidence like solving a question paper, they leave it with the help of a question paper.
Let us know from them the way they can achieve success by cutting off this expedition.
Namaskar Me Viswanathan Anand.
Let me begin by conveying my best wishes for your exams.
I will now share my experience on how I will go for my exams.
I realized that exams are similar to the problems that are being faced in your body.
You should rest properly , you should sleep peacefully in the night , you should eat in the belly , you must not be hungry and most important thing is that you should stay calm .
All this is like the left of the intelligence itself .
When you are playing, you don't know, you don't know, you don't even know what kind of question is going to be raised in the examination.
That is why if you are calm and you have had a fill of stomach , you have slept properly then you will know that your brain is reminded of the correct answer at the right time .
That's why it's quiet.
Do not stress yourself too much , do not expect too much .
Is it important to look at this as a challenge - why can I ask me what I have learnt in a year
Recall the most important thing in the last minute, remember those things that don't remember, while examining, you might recall some events with your teachers or with your students and this will help you to remember a lot of things.
If you illuminate the difficult questions then you will find that these are new questions for you. And when you examine, you will be able to solve them in a better way.
Therefore, be calm, take a good night, do not show immense self-confidence, but do not be disappointed at that time.
I have always seen that this examination is better than you were afraid.
And while playing with international intellect, you must have seen them how they sit with them.
However, it is difficult to say this thing but we should make efforts.
You don't talk to friends, you go alone, you stay like a commassion girl, you keep on washing the book for the last moment and you will not be able to keep your mind calm.
If the water is calm then it is very deep but if the surface of the water gets rotten then nothing below is visible .
At that time it feels like internal tension.
Then I feel that if you rest a little then it will be better.
I myself have developed a system for this.
I breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe thrice or five times deeply.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds for all this, but after that my mind was calm and I was prepared to understand the subject.
It is also possible that my experience will be of great help to you.
Silver Agrawal has said a good thing.
Whatever is written on my pages, at least half of the day, we should spend time in delight with our friends and families.
And what would you do
Friends, don't do that.
If you have ever visited a place with your parents then you should come out of the study for at least half an hour.
It is like this that we should understand the issue of Rajat ji.
Friends, Can I tell you about Shanti
Today, before you are tested, one such person has sent a message to you that he is basically a teacher and today he has become a Sanskrit teacher.
Ramcharit Manasa is connecting this great epic with the present time and is trying to foster these cultures across the country and around the world.
That revered Murari Bapu has said a clue about studentism.
Friends, I would like to tell you one more thing today.
G.
But one thing is certain, be it the student condition that Yoga is like Gurukul in the journey of achieving the development of the second half of life.
You must pay attention to it.
I have full faith in it.
My young friends, do you feel that you have the greatest need to go to the examination centre to go to the portals and sit on your back
Otherwise tension arises in mind from it .
If you understand those suggestions, you will not have time to regret them.
I have also seen that the nature of the uestion Paper has changed.
In his message, Shri Rao highlighted the issue of patience.
In a short span of time, the beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rao Saheb.
R.
Rao speaks.
I am fully aware that because of examinations, there is also a lot of discomfort in it due to competitive examinations.
Don't worry.
I would like to tell all my young friends to give you the best.
But at the same time, it should be kept in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
Decide what you want to do in your life and do not quit it, you will succeed.
Do not forget that you are the servants of this world. Like trees and mountains, you also have the right to live here.
You need that letter of dedication and dedication.
With these qualities, you will succeed in all exams and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you all for whatever you have to do.
Many blessings.
"How is there a scientific method of talking about the issues in the forefront
It takes me half an hour to say that in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rava Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
He spoke of dedication, determination and diligence.
Friends standing firmly.
If you are standing firmly then you will feel afraid too.
And the golden future will wait for you to be accomplished with your hands.
Ruchika Dabus has sent a message to me.
And it is true that Sachin ji also said that a positive attitude, a positive state of mind, a positive energy.
Sometimes a lot of things that will inspire us, do not think that only students get inspiration.
Any moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of life, every moment of truth gives us immense inspiration, every moment of life gives us immense strength.
We read about Thomas Alva Edison, the father of Electricity Division.
Friends, Have you ever thought about how many years they had spent in this research
He did not have any special education in mathematics, but he put a lot of emphasis on various sectors such as mathematical classification and uncertainty.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this power was important for him.
In today's era, this test is not only for students but also for all families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal said that the parents should not bear the burden of their expectations on the children.
And after seeing this, we not only go out of lamps but also like getting hands with them.
We also want to make progress at the pace of science.
This is the reason that today is the National Science Day.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
And in his memory, on 28 February, we celebrate National Science Day across the country.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Every generation has to pay attention to new innovations, to inculcate scientific thoughts in every mind, to attract science.
New research is not possible without the participation of science and technology.
Today, on the occasion of National Science Day, new innovations across the country should be encouraged.
I am Sir C.
Friends, sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when success comes, our attitude towards the world also changes.
You must have heard that in the last few days there has been a big and important discovery in the world of science.
Scientists from all over the world have worked hard, many generations have come, they have done something or the other.
This discovery strengthened the theory of the great scientist Einstein of the last century, not only this, but also a great discovery in the field of physics.
It is a matter of fact that the entire humanity will benefit the entire world.
It is a matter of great pride and pride for us as an Indian that the sons of our country and the skilled scientists of our country shared this entire research process.
Our scientists will make efforts to further this new discovery in the near future.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, a significant decision has been taken recently in this regard.
The Government has decided to set up a Laser Interface Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India to take the lead in this discovery.
There are two such centres in the world, the third will be in India.
India's participation will give a new energy and a new impetus to this process.
With limited resources, India will actively participate in this great scientific discovery of human welfare.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you one number.
By giving a missed call to this number, you will be able to listen to me from tomorrow.
May we listen to our mother tongue.
81908-81908. I reiterate that 81908-81908.
Friends, I am going to get your exams tomorrow.
125 crore Indians are going to take my exams.
Yesterday, I was tested that Parva will start with you.
And the country will succeed only when we all succeed.
Friends, I convey my best wishes to you.
Freedom from the stress of success and failure, move forward with a free mind.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said two things.
Recently, we have celebrated the Christmas Festival and have started preparations for the New Year.
India has diversified into diversity.
Festivals are celebrated with fanfare .
Sometimes it feels that India is a country where the economy is based on values.
Whether the entire world is free from crisis or be it terrorism or be it global warming or be it natural crisis or be it man-made, all mankind live in happiness and peace
You are aware that I use technology in a big way and I get ample information about various topics.
I have always seen MyGov portal.
People visit different places to celebrate Christmas Day.
However, special attention is being paid to the tourists in the tourism sector that wherever there are tourist destinations, there are dharamshalas and religious places, there should be special focus on cleanliness.
And as we say, "Guest Devo Bhava", we are cleaning the house and decorating the house when our guests are coming.
Therefore, we should pay special attention to the cleanliness of our tourist places and religious places.
In Bhojpura village in Sihor district of Madhya Pradesh Dilip Singh Malviya lives with senior artisans at an age .
I felt that it was read and it should reach you.
Dilip Singh Malviya, who lives in the village of Chhotayasya, decided that if someone provides the goods for constructing toilets in the village, he will not take the construction wages, he will make toilets free.
Assuming that construction of toilets is a sacred task, Dilip Singh constructed 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Dilip Singh Malviya.
This country is progressing at a rapid pace due to the untiring efforts of several people.
When every Indian comes to know that all the people of India are attracted to Yoga, and when the whole world celebrates International Day of Yoga and when the whole world is connected then we feel confident that this is our India.
When we see a vast form then this feeling of belief arises in your mind.
The topic of cleanliness is now being discussed in a way.
Increases participation of citizens among them.
The biggest advantage of this thing is that those government employees who have been working to provide electricity to the villages, they will be satisfied that they have been taking the responsibility of transforming the lives of a village and they will be glad that whether it is the farmers, the poor, the women, the youth or the youth should reach these things.
It is their right to ensure that no government has done any work and no government has done any work so that they dont lose it.
We have to make every effort so that the right thing, good things, things that are being used for the common man can reach them.
In a way, it is a service.
I have made a small effort on my behalf.
I cannot do this alone, but when I tell you, I should not do anything.
We have to reach out to 125 crore Indians.
How can I reach without your help
We should reach them in the language of the common man and motivate them to get their rights.
My young friends, in the address delivered by the Red Fort on 15th August, I had made a preliminary discussion on the theme Startup India Stand up India.
After that, the work started in every department of the government.
Can India become the world capital in terms of start-ups
In a new way, with new innovations, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for the youth of our states, be it the manufacturing sector, the services sector or the agriculture sector.
In every case, new ideas, new experiments and new endeavours need to be innovated.
Start-up India, Stand-up India scheme is a big opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on the 16th of January, the Government of India will present a full-fledged roadmap for the Start-up India Stand-up India scheme.
But it is not like this that we have to change it as per the requirements of India.
It is expected that our young friends should explore something that will reduce the hard work and hard work of a poor person.
I urge the state governments to take initiative in this regard.
On 16th January, I will talk to you more detailedly.
I will always welcome your suggestions.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, millions and millions of people of this country have taken inspiration from Swami Vivekananda.
Their birth anniversary is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 12th January, 1995.
This year, the event will be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
I am aware that this year's theme is Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Honey.
In his school, Excel India Day celebrated SulabhSankar Bharat Diwas, he expressed his feelings on telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet those people working in the society, there are many ideas in mind.
Now it is true that every word has its own importance.
I would have visited the programme launched by the Government of India this year. However, due to the Mahapura in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I could not attend the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan programme.
But I used to feel like going to that programme.
Therefore, I felt that in our country, instead of the word 'Divyang', we should use the term 'Divyang'.
These are the people with whom there are more or less such parts that have a divine power and a divine power, which is not with the people like us.
I liked this word very much.
The citizens of my country will now popularise the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan on that day.
Implementation of the necessary infrastructure, both directly and indirectly, to provide accessible habitats to the Divyangjans.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, ramps at railway stations, accessibility parking, accessibility flights, Braille scripts etc.
They like this.
We should also participate in it in our own way.
My dear countrymen, government schemes continue to come and go, but these schemes are not just artificial intelligence but they also need a consciousness.
It should reach the last mile in a better way.
Their breath should not be inhaled in the files .
The government of India has made an effort a few days ago to bring the benefits of the scheme to the common man, to the right person and to the needy.
Grant is given to LPG cylinders in our country.
This amount is of crores of rupees but we did not have the system to ensure that it did not reach the beneficiaries in the right time.
The government has made some changes in it.
The worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (DBT) scheme has been implemented with the help of Jan Dhan Bank Account and Aadhaar Card and the subsidy amount has been deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I would like to proudly assert that this initiative has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records as the worlds largest and most successful Direct Benefit Transfer scheme.
The scheme is known as Pahal.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore LPG holders have become beneficiaries of Pahal scheme.
15 crore people have been directly credited to the bank accounts.
No deal, nobody's recommendations are required, there is no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, opening of Aadhaar card and Jan Dhan accounts on the other and on the third hand, the State Government and the Central Government are working together to link the beneficiaries with Aadhaar number and Accounts number.
A few days back, MNREGA will create employment opportunities in the villages.
There were several complaints about this.
I am sure that about 35-40 schemes are now being included under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment of Indian Republic Day.
It is the centenary year of the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The Constitution was discussed in Parliament for two days and it was done in a very good manner.
All the parties have discussed the importance of deciding, the importance of deciding and understanding the root cause of the incident. We should continue this initiative.
Can people do the work of connecting the state with the people on Republic Day
There should always be discussions and discussions about the events that have given us greater powers.
It is our sacred duty to ensure that a large number of polling booths are written on the walls during elections.
"Why doesn't it happen in life as much as we talk about our duties at the time of voting
Babasaheb Ambedkar on his 125th birth anniversary, on 26th January, what is the need to organise essay competitions, poetry competitions and essay competitions in schools, colleges, villages and societies in the cities
If 1. 25 billion Indians move ahead with one step after the other with a sense of duty then it will be a great history.
I want to know your thoughts.
Send your writings to MyGov.
I would like to know what the younger generation of my country is thinking about.
And I am not speaking at the government level.
We build the effigies of great men with great devotion but afterwards we are distressed about taking care of them.
On the other hand, preparations for cotton must have started.
Festivals have a special significance in society.
Sometimes these festivals foment sadness and sometimes they create new ones.
But sometimes during these festivals if there is any crisis then it is very painful .
There are reports of natural calamities from every corner of the world.
There are reports of natural calamities that we have never heard or have not thought of.
We are now experiencing the impact of climate change.
The way in which there has been heavy rainfall in our country in the last few days and the way in which there has been a loss in Tamil Nadu and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I convey my heartfelt condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State Governments are doing rescue and relief work with full force.
The central government too always works shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team of Government of India has visited Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that even after this crisis that has hit Tamil Nadu, he will once again start moving ahead with confidence and the role that he plays in the development of the country will be fulfilled.
But when we look at the crisis around us, we need to make several changes in this thing.
15 years ago, the natural calamities were part of the agriculture sector as the natural calamities were confined to the drought.
Today it is changing its form.
We need to enhance our capabilities at every level.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens, all the small and big institutions will have to work with the approach of science.
After the Nepal earthquake, I interacted with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and suggested that SAARC countries should jointly conduct a joint exercise to prepare for disaster response.
I am glad that a workshop on SAARC countries and best practices was held in Delhi.
A good beginning has been made.
Lakhwinder Singh telephoned me from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
Mr. Lakhwinder Singh is speaking from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We do organic farming here and guide many about this farming.
I have a question of how those people who plant cattle or cows in the fields cannot understand how these microbes die due to this and how they can be guided by the pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
I am very happy to hear your question.
You will be happy because you are an organic farming farmer and you not only do organic farming yourself but you also know the problems of the farmers very well.
Your concerns are correct but this is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of people all over India and in a traditional way we burn the remains of crops like this.
But the pain you have expressed is correct .
First of all, we should educate our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and explain to them the truthfulness that if the remains of crops are burnt then the time will be saved and the fields will be produced for the next crop.
But this is not true.
We destroy it but if we do small pieces of these ruins then it will be a dry fodder for the animals.
Secondly, after burning it, the upper level of the ground burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Just imagine for a while that your bones should be strong, your hearts should be strong, kidneys should be good, but if the skin of the body burns then what will happen
We cannot survive even if the heart is alright.
The way skin of our body burns it is difficult for us to remain alive , similarly the skin of our ribs burn not only on burning sensation but also of mother 's skin .
Animals will not only be used as fodder but they will also be able to save their land. If they put the fertilizer produced in that land then it will be double beneficial.
The water in those pits is sufficient for that crop and today their pits have also been valued.
They are now getting income from these pits too.
Earlier, the pegs that had to be spent on cleaning, today that peg has also become a source of income and the demand for it is increasing.
Dear Countrymen, the upcoming 3rd December will be celebrated as International Day of Persons with Disabilities across the world.
November 27, 2018 was celebrated as India's Organ Donation Day.
Film actress Ravina Tandon and other eminent personalities participated in the event.
Many valuable lives can be saved by organ donation.
Organ donation provides immortality in a way.
When an organ from one body goes to the other body then that organ does get a new life but that person also gets a new life.
What can be a greater donation than this
A National Registration on Organs and Organ Transplants has been started on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this area and in the true sense it will provide the best support to the needy because this assistance cannot be available till the time no organ is donated.
As I have said earlier, December 3 is being celebrated as 'Divyang Diwas'.
Physically handicapped people are also adventurous and capable .
When such individuals are defrauded, they suffer.
Sometimes compassion is shown on them.
But if we change our attitude towards seeing them then we will know that these people can inspire us to lead our lives.
They can inspire to do something.
If there is a small crisis on us then we are crying.
Then you will realize that the crisis on me is very small.
How will it lead our lives
How do they work
And that is why all these are inspiring for us.
Their determination, their way of life and the power to reverse the crisis will be supplied.
Javad Ahmad, today I would like to mention this thing that it is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Jawad Ahmad was shot dead by terrorists in Kashmir.
One part of stomach and intestine is also lost .
Mankaya was seriously injured.
He always lost his power to stand on his feet, but Jawad Ahmad did not give up.
How can we improve infrastructure for physically handicapped persons
How can we develop facilities for persons with disabilities in public places and government offices
They are working on these issues.
Whether the life of Jawans is not enough to be inspiring in every corner of the country
I specially remember the life of Shri Javed Ahmad, his penance and dedication on 3rd December.
Though I mention only Jawad because of the short time, I have been inspiring every corner of the country.
They are showing new ways and new ways of life.
Be it middle class, junior middle class, poor, dalit, oppressed, exploited, deprived sections of the society, they continue to be associated with the government and the government system. And this trust has sometimes changed our attitude of looking at the government system for the entire life.
This is true, but millions of people of this government do such good work with dedication and dedication that we never see.
Last year we had jointly awarded Padma Vibhushan to Building Gates and Milinda Gates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
Whatever he has earned during his retirement, he has spent his entire life working for the poor.
When he comes to India, he appreciates the ASHA workers who have got the opportunity to work with him.
He tells us how excited he is to learn new things.
A few days ago, the Government of Odisha had specially honoured an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
Jamuna Manisingh, an ASHA worker from this village, decided that I will not let anyone in Tedagaon die due to malaria.
Go to every household of his family and reach there even if he finds out that there is some fever.
There will be many more such "Jamuna Mani".
There will be millions of people who will be with us.
We have received them with a little respect.
Such people become the strength of our country.
How do we become a big partner in the happiness and misery of the society
I salute all such ASHA activists through "Jamuna Mani".
My dear young friends, I am particularly active on internet and social media for the younger generation.
Not only this, show it to others as well, it can be such a thing that you will feel like connecting something with it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to join this nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
Climate change and global warming are being discussed everywhere and it is being considered as a standard before every work is being done.
The temperature of the earth should not increase further.
It is the responsibility and responsibility of everyone.
And the first way of saving energy is to prevent temperature rise.
14th December is National Energy Savings Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, one should remain in the light of the moon on full moon for hours by closing the lamps on the streets.
We should experience the light of that moon.
On seeing a woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur on TV it seemed as if she had not got the opportunity to study a lot .
But he is doing such a thing that no one might have thought about it.
It is illuminating the lives of the poor by using solar energy.
She is fighting against darkness and she is lighting her tongue.
She has set up a committee of women and has started a solar-powered factory, which pays a rent of 100 rupees per month.
What kind of assistance are being provided to entrepreneurs like us
Industry, earnings, equilibrium.
However, the speed at which I have to go is still going on.
But the beginning has improved.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that out of 66 lakh women, there are 24 lakh women and if the help is received then there are Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes who are trying to live up to their families with dignity by standing on their own feet.
Abhishek himself has spoken of his zeal.
I have a lot of news too.
Someone has just told me that someone in Mumbai is Shailesh Bhosale.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and Shailesh Bhosale has done it.
And I was told that in such a short span of time they have refunded two lakh rupees to the bank.
It is working to make potatoes.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor as much as possible.
Indeed, these are the people who run the economy of the country.
Small and medium enterprises are the economic powers of the country's economy.
We want to give it more strength.
But we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things that should lead to a constant awareness in social life.
Efficiency under National Jagriam Vyam is the prize for freedom.
How should the programme be planned
I had told you about sending such information.
I was told that a lot of information was received.
But I need more information.
I expect a very special scheme.
There can be many such things.
I believe that your suggestions will definitely be useful.
But I would urge you to exercise.
To keep body fit definitely use some time of this excellent season for exercise .
If there is a dense weather then we should also make a habit of shaking.
Once again my best wishes to my countrymen.
Once again I am visiting you through Mann Ki Baat.
The 5th one-day cricket match between India and South Africa is being played.
The Cricket Malike is called Gandhi-Mandela series.
Both sides have conquered each other and therefore, the significance of the last fight has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all my sportspersons.
Today, I would like to convey my best wishes to the friends of Kannur All India Radio.
I would like to convey my best wishes to you all that when I started Mann Ki Baat, many people visited that programme, 12th students from Kerala also joined the Shraddha Thamban.
Once again I want to talk about Kerala.
Students from St. Mary Upper Primary School, Kochia Chittoor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
At the outset, I didn't know why these kids made me a map of India.
When I read his letters, I realized that he had delivered such a massive symbolic message.
So that organ donation becomes a tendency and tendency.
Those girls have written to me and have written to me that you should challenge people about organ donation through your Mann Ki Baat programme.
The 80-year-old Vasharrao Sudke Guru ji from Maharashtra has been continuously running a movement.
He says organ donation should be a festival.
I have a lot of messages from the telephone.
DebeshJi of Delhi has given me a message.
I believe that this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people in our country need kidney, heart and liver every year.
But in our country with a population of 125 crore only five thousand transplants i . . organ transplants are operated .
Every year one lakh eyes are needed but only 25 , 000 people get their eyesight .
When there is a need for four rounds then we can give only one thread.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some states have done a good job to speed up the efforts of organ donation by reducing the paperwork.
Today I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of the organ donation.
A lot of social institutions, a lot of NGOs have given a different direction by doing good work.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization, NOTO has been set up to give importance to Organ Transplant.
Ten-Titteen Bhunjitha is the best pleasure in abandoning it.
Last month we had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
Save a life.
My dear countrymen, now we celebrate Navratri and Vijaya Dashami.
After a few days, we will celebrate Diwali.
Eid celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
However, we are going to celebrate another festival among all these things that will make our country proud and will make the country proud.
India-Africa Forensic Summit will be held in New Delhi from 26-29 October 2019.
This is the first time that such a big event will be held in India.
54 African countries and Union Leaders have been invited.
The population of Africa is as much as the population of India.
If both the populations come together then it will become a third of the world's population.
And it is said that the territory of these two countries was united millions of years ago.
Later, the Indian Ocean was divided into two parts.
And see, it is our endeavor that people should also come together and come together.
On this occasion, the Government of India has organized a massive programme of HRD Ministry.
An essay competition was held among the children in the schools where CBSE has affiliated schools, poetry writing programmes and programmes were organized to enhance their participation.
Approximately 1600 schools participated.
It included schools from outside India and India and thousands of schoolchildren wrote about the desire to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the Mobile Exhibition, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, from Porbandar to Memorials of Mahatma Gandhi, which is a mobile exhibition, has travelled from Porbandar to the Northern States and reached Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of school children watched the exhibition and people from the villages also witnessed the exhibition.
People knew and discovered the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on the two regions of Africa and India's relations.
Though India-Africa is a summit, I can see that this is an opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate Garima and the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and HRD ministry.
On 15th August, I had made a proposal regarding the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Last month, a workshop was held in Bhopal where ideal villages are being organized, the heads of the villages, the collectors of that place, some MPs of that place, the government of India and the state government together discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
In what way new things came to mind, some enthusiastic things came to light.
He has selected Parsi Gram Panchayats in Kunti District of Jharkhand for their ideal village.
In the Adarsh Gram, a successful effort was made to create public awareness along with infrastructure and system in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I congratulate the Honble Parliamentarian Shri Kariya Mundanji.
And I got a news from Andhra.
Andhra Parliamentarian Ashok Gajapathi Rajuji was very much involved in the Adarsh Gram Yojana and he chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh as an ideal village.
Nearly 550 adult illiterates were taught and literated to them.
See, there is no budget, no circular, no special system in the society but what kind of changes are being brought about due to the will power, this thing is being seen through Gram Panchayats.
However, our respected Parliamentarian Shriman C.
L. Ruwala, a Member of Parliament of Mizoram.
He has chosen the village of Khwalahillang as an ideal village. He did a special job.
This village is very famous for the production of sugarcane and jaggery .
How can we make the village a centre of economic vision, how can we market the village products
Ruvalaji, who tried to build a self-reliant village along with the ideal village, deserves congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, Mann Ki Baat will never happen.
I would like to remind you my dear countrymen, the media had launched a special drive last year on the occasion of Diwali. After Diwali, all the things that had broken down had been shown on the channel to the masses.
We should worry about the accidents that do not happen before the festival, but also after the festival.
And that is why I want to specially congratulate the media world of India.
On 2nd October, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I had the privilege of participating in the Swachhta Sammelan through India Today Group.
He was looking at the efforts made by Clean India Awards in whichever way they are trying.
How people are working on the lines of One Life, One Mission.
What are the places that have been kept clean in our country
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has started, I have seen that the e-Nadu of Andhra Telangana, and especially Mr.
He has added about 51 lakh children in 55-56 schools to Andhra and Telangana.
In some places, be it public places or stations or religious places or parks, a big campaign related to cleanliness has been started.
Now this news shows the power to realize this dream of Swachh Bharat.
ABP News started this programme called Bharat Desh Hai Mera and people became aware of cleanliness and made it mandatory and trained the countrymen.
NDTV has launched a campaign called Swachh Bharat.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Shriman Shanmukh Nathan has written to me a letter and mentioned the village of Mavalaynong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the past few years, this village has taken up the issue of cleanliness.
Almost every generation is dedicated to this cleanliness, it is said that a few years ago, he had received the Client Village Award in Asia.
This is important that we all want to believe that our country will be clean and it will be done by the efforts of the countrymen. If we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019 then we can proudly say that 100 crore Indians will be free from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had said this thing from the Red Fort on 15th August, there are some things that have been brought about by corruption and have done the house.
And that is why I felt the need for an Interview for small jobs.
I have never heard such a thing in the world that there is a psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychological psychology that can make a person perfectly aware of it
And with this idea, I had announced that we should stop the tradition of signing for these jobs.
My dear young friends, today I would like to say with pride that the government has completed all these procedures and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will not be invited on the occasion of Bharati.
The Rules will come into force from 1st January, 2016 and wherever the process of recruitment is underway, we will not be able to expend, but will come into force from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
In our country, gold has become an important part of social life.
Gold can become a power, gold can become an economic power.
And every Indian must contribute to it.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will give you interest on it just as you deposit your money and get interest on it.
Earlier they used to keep gold in the locker and they used to pay the locker rent as well.
Now keep it in the Gold Bank and the bank will give you interest.
Now the countrymen, can't gold be a wealth
The second thing is that in the Sovereign Gold Bond, this bond is a paper, but the value of that paper is gold.
On the day when this paper is returned, on the day of refund you will get the amount of gold as much as the price.
I am glad to say that we are bringing gold quin.
It took nearly 70 years after the independence of the gold quin that brought the Ashok Chakra but till now we have been using the Foreign Gold quin.
Gold Building Bonds are also used abroad.
In the coming weeks, we are going to make it available to the common man before Dhanteras, we are launching the golden coin of 5 grams and 10 grams Ashok Chakra.
With this, 20 grams of gold will be available for the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new transformation in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was reminded that the map of India comes out.
This great man has contributed immensely to the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
India is full of many sects, many sects, many dialects, many species, many surroundings and many diversities and this diversity is our beauty and beauty.
If there was no diversity then we could not take pride in the beauty of this festival.
Therefore, it is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the real burdens of development.
Over the last few years, RAN-FOR-UNITI programmes are being organized in every corner of the country on 31st October.
The race for unity is also a course of development in the true sense.
Pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, Now you must have been preparing for Diwali and there will be cleanliness in your house.
You are buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the festival of Diwali.
Burning sensation starts from bursting and the bursting causes a lot of damage to the children .
I would like to tell every parent that if they loot the joy of Diwali then dont let the accident happen, there should not be any harm to the son of our family.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting the UK on the second day of Diwali.
The government of India and the state government provide scholarships to those dalits, tribals and backward classes of the society who go abroad for studying.
I believe that when our children will be taught in Britain, then Baba Saheb's place will become an inspiration and a lesson in life will be taught for the country.
You can imagine how happy the people like me will be by connecting this building with the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which will become the wealth of 1. 25 billion Indians.
I will get another opportunity in London and I would like to unveil the statue of Lord Vishweshwar Ji.
Several years ago, the work that Lord Visvesvara had done for democracy, for the Employment of Women, needs to be studied by the world.
The dedication of the Statue of Lord Visvesvara to the soil of London is a good example of how the great men of India thought and vision several years ago.
My dear countrymen, you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat.
He was interacting with the government officials.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn so many languages
But I am grateful to All India Radio for telecasting this Mann Ki Baat in their regional language at 8 pm.
Once again my best wishes to my beloved countrymen.
Jai Hind.
On 3rd October last year, for the first time, I will have the privilege of conveying my heart.
Democracy is of immense importance.
There is a fundamental idea in my life and therefore I have full faith in the power of the people.
But I can say this thing from what I have learnt from Mann Ki Baat, from what I have learnt, from what I have learnt, from what I have learnt.
Our ancestors used to say that Jananadan is a part of God.
I can say from the experience of Mann Ki Baat that there is a great power in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this thing.
I have asked the people to invite them for Mann Ki Baat and I have seen only two or four suggestions.
But lakhs of people actively sent information.
This is a great strength.
When people were watching this, they also felt that the feeling of sadness and dilemma towards the daughters would have to be changed.
This was a silent revolution.
Keeping in view the tourism scenario in India, I told the people, Incredible India, Incredible India and Incredible India.
People from every part of India sent photographs in lakhs.
The tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government will never have any idea that we have such a rich legacy.
Everything came to a forum and it did not cost a single rupee.
People did all these things.
Today, I can say with immense satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
Once I had said this thing in Mann Ki Baat that the poor households are littered, the children are crying, their poor mothers are watching the picture.
Whether they should not get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society then the government can work as a catalyst for social transformation.
Every small thing was considered a small issue and tried to connect itself for the welfare of the country.
What can be a bigger pleasure than this .
I have decided to do a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I requested the citizens of the country to send your questions, your suggestions to me on telephone.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
I am glad that more than 5,500 telephone calls have been received from all over the country be it Citin, Kutch, Kamrup or Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is not a single region in India from where citizens have not telephoned.
It is a pleasant experience.
The citizens of all age groups raised their views and raised their views.
I heard some of them myself and I felt that my team worked on the proposals on other issues.
You might have taken a couple of minutes to make this telephone call but the delivery, ideas and issues received from it are important for me.
The entire government will certainly work on it.
What is the importance of radio for such blind people
I see from a new perspective and he has said that many good things, good issues, are sufficient to sensitize the government.
I would like to invite the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to urge the people of India to make maximum use of soil fertilizers in Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
The naval forces and the Air Force, which protects water, land and sky.
Fifty years have passed since the 1965 war with Pakistan.
We have not only heard about the pride, pride, courage and sacrifices made by our soldiers during the times of war, but even though the technologies of photography and cinema are not available at that time, it is certainly possible to feel the moments and sacrifices made by the soldiers.
Whether it is Hajifir or the North or the Chamid, the sight of the victory achieved near Hajipir Pass is thrilled and the pride in the Indian Army is filled with pride.
If you want to make history then you will have to understand the smaller issues.
History has endured our bonds with our children.
Breaking the breasts of history gives a complete break to the possibility of history.
A little boy has given an order to the Prime Minister but in Ghaghai, he forgot to mention his own name.
And I can tell you that for the first time since independence, there has been a lot of discussion in the Parliament on Swachhata.
Our government was also critical.
I had to hear a lot that Modi ji was talking about cleanliness but what did he say
I don't mind listening to this, but it shows me a good thing that there is talk of cleanliness of India in the Parliament of the country.
And on the other hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, when this small son of the country speaks of cleanliness then there cannot be any such thing for the country to run away from it.
This movement is going on and there is a growing awareness about cleanliness and hygiene.
With this, the government will also have to work, it will be indispensable to work and work.
In 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we should work in that direction to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
You know what Mahatma Gandhi is saying
At one place, he says that when it comes to choosing one of the two freedoms and cleanliness, I will give priority to cleanliness. Cleanliness was more important than independence for Gandhiji.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi visited Mygov.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men continue to inspire us.
It is not your job to evaluate what kind of ideas this great man would have considered.
All those who live for the country and those who die for the country will inspire us.
These days will provide an opportunity to remember all these great personalities.
Innumerable names like Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September, Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, Lal Bahadur Shastri on 11th October, Jaiprakash Narayanji on 11th October and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
You can see any date, from the point of view of history, the name of some great person will be associated with that date.
I once again request you, especially for 2nd October.
On 2nd October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot do by giving publicity by spending a lot of money is helped by a small act of yours.
This is the manpower and I once again urge you to do this thing.
My dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of one thing.
Chandra Bose had made all the arrangements with the statue of Subhash Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family took up this work and in the last few weeks, we received a strong message that the 50th family of Subhash Babu will be visiting the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine how much pleasure it will be for me.
They will often get the opportunity to visit the Prime Ministers residence, together for the first time.
But I am delighted to know that there has never been such a visit to the Prime Minister's residence before, which I will have the privilege to do in the month of October.
More than 50 brothers and sisters of Subhash Babu, family members of different countries will be able to come up with all the issues.
It will be a moment of joy for me.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to awaken the young generation about the registration of voters, which will increase the participation of the youth in the coming days, and in the future, the young generation will be able to collaborate in selecting and running the government.
I hope that the youngsters who have not yet registered their names in the electoral rolls will definitely register and vote.
Kshitij Pandey, a student of the seventh century, met me at the Anaras Hindu University and at the Kendriya Vidyalaya, he learns and is a master.
Dandaga is confident with him.
At this young age, I would have read a lot about it in physics.
Sadavrat Patel's daughter, who lives in Sundarpur in Varanasi.
On the other hand, her husband said, No, if she takes up a book of mathematics, she opens all the fabrics, history in the evening and shines in the evening.
I am very impressed by the fact that all our families are surprised.
Sometimes these kids get reputed but I don't know about Sonam.
I felt that Devan had given me a power.
I got the opportunity to meet these two children during my visit to Kashi.
Similarly, I would like to remember the visit of these two children.
Through Mann Ki Baat, a lot of people are listening to me.
Look at this thing, what does Sandeep of Haryana say, Sir Mann Ki Baat once a month, please do it every week because you get a lot of inspiration from listening to your speeches.
Sandeep ji, what can you do from me
Once a month, I have to do a lot of hard work, I have to plan time.
At present, it is only once a month.
In a way, the mind was saved one year.
Do you know how to use Subhash Babu radio
From Germany, he had started his radio centre and had to inform the citizens of India about the freedom movement from this radio centre.
He started the Azad Hind Radio with a weekly newspaper.
He used to broadcast radio from English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and Parsi Urdu languages.
It's been a year since I was talking about All India Radio.
Keep sending your information, ideas and proposals.
It also benefits the government.
Reforms begin.
Your contribution, your participation is valuable and invaluable.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
The citizens of South India are painted on the occasion of Onam and yesterday they celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has started several new schemes for the common man keeping in mind the issue of social security.
I am glad that in a short span of time everyone has accepted this scheme.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had requested my sisters to visit these security schemes.
I have been told that since the launch of this scheme, 11 crore families have been connected to them. And I have been told that the mothers and sisters have got the benefits of this scheme.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
Today, while talking to you, it has been a year since the Jan Dhan Yojana was launched in a big way.
Banking sector is also an important part of the economy and banking sector has also been strengthened to ensure that this system reaches the poorest of the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Youngsters have also got employment.
You will be happy to note that in this year, 1 lakh 31 thousand Economic Literacy Camps have been organised to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Only the accounts cannot be opened and stopped.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facility under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
It is a belief that the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again I congratulate all of you and urge all those who have opened the bank accounts to the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters to keep their bank accounts intact.
This bank is yours, now do not leave it.
I have brought the bank to you, now it is your job to keep it in mind.
Recently, due to the violence in Gujarat, the entire country was distressed. And it is natural that if something happens in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar, then the entire country is hit first.
But in a very short span of time all my swollen brothers and sisters of Gujarat have brought the situation under control.
And once again Gujarat started on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and fraternity are the right paths and the path of development and shoulder to shoulder.
Development is the answer to our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet scholars from the Sufi sect.
I got the opportunity to listen to their thoughts and tell you the truth, I felt like listening to some music.
I came here to talk to these scholars about the selectiveness of their words, the way of speaking, the generosity of the Sufi tradition, the kindness of music in which there is a rhythm of music.
I felt immensely impatient.
Often, there is a need to reach out to the true world of Islam.
The Sufi sect, which is linked to love and beauty, will spread this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity, it will also benefit Islam and I also tell others that we should understand the Sufi sect, the Sufi sect and the Sufi tradition.
I am fortunate that I will get another opportunity in the coming days and I will get this invitation.
Scholars from Buddhist traditions from all over the world will come to Bodh Gaya in India and discuss global issues related to the benefit of humanity and welfare.
I am delighted to be invited to Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru visited Bodh Gaya.
It is a matter of great pleasure for me that I will have the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya along with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Once again, I would like to share with you my thoughts.
I had mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat earlier too.
You might have heard from me in my speeches in Parliament, in public meetings, in Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I have been telling you that the government of India is open on the issue of Land Acquisition Act.
This means that the situation before the formation of my government has been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to assure you that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a declaration for us.
This mantra is the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August we had said that not only the agriculture sector but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be set up.
We are implementing this decision promptly.
Twenty years before the 1965 war and when the 1965 war was over, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji remembered it.
I salute and salute all those who have conquered India in the 65th World War.
These events in history will always inspire us.
Just like I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi sect last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to meet renowned scientists from all over the country and interact with them for hours.
I am happy to learn that India has been doing excellent work in the field of science in many directions.
Our scientific tactics are performing well.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it was not only a source of inspiration for me but also a source of innovation.
And I saw how many young scientists were speaking with zeal, how many dreams were there in their eyes.
I had said this thing from Mann Ki Baat that students should move towards the field of science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are immense opportunities and there are many possibilities.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends should look at science and our educational institutions should inspire students for it.
He has written about skill development.
Sriman Prakash from Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu has stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
Emphasis has been laid on reforms in education sector.
I would like to tell my young friends in particular.
In a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that for what purpose is this interview for lower level jobs
And when letters are issued for childbirth then every poor family, widowed mother becomes worried that who will get the recommendation and who will get this job with the help of someone
You don't know what words are used
One of the reasons for corruption at the grassroots level was the race for all.
I had said in my speech on 15th August that the government has taken rapid steps in this regard that it has been 15 days in such a short span of time.
The decision will now be implemented to ensure that the information is being sent and not blocked for smaller posts.
It is unfortunate that about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die every year after delivery and after delivery.
It is worrisome and horrible .
There has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and new devotees.
We are watching it on television but we don't pay attention to it but we don't see it.
Along with pure water, it is important to keep small things clean at home.
Life is extremely valuable.
It is not right to neglect unhygienic water, sadness about sanitation is the cause of death.
Dengue testing is done at approximately 514 centres across the country.
Raksha Bandhan to Diwali is a period of several festivals in our country.
May each one of our festivals be associated with cleanliness. See, the quality of cleanliness will automatically come into your habits.
I have always said that you will not get the privilege of dedicating your life for the country but you will certainly get the privilege of life for the country.
Two young brothers and sisters of our country, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Everybody is making every effort to take the country forward. And that is why everybody is filled with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to lack of understanding.
However, my experience in the field of youth is different.
Sometimes we get to know and learn new things by talking to them.
I have met several youngsters who have said that I have taken the Sand on Cycle.
There is a decision of one day cycle day of the week.
He said that the joy of being healthy, environment-friendly and young is always enjoyable.
The attacks in our country will increase the number of cycles in many households and many people will be encouraged.
I am glad to note that today two youngsters of my country have flagged off Indias flag in the United States, so the youth of India are also thinking about it.
I specially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The memorial will inspire us to work with the dalits, the oppressed, the persecuted and the deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that have honoured Dr. Ambedkar.
The country can be moved forward by putting a shoulder to shoulder.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
It will definitely help our farmer brothers and sisters in the field of Kharif seeds.
One more thing I remembered was that I should feel cheerful.
Our country has always been in a dilemma of bitterness and oil.
The poorest of the poor has to face stiffness, there is some oil in the food and vegetables.
I am glad that the cereals that have been manufactured this year have increased by 50 per cent and oilseeds production by nearly 33 per cent.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this thing.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The country's land belongs to the farmers and also to the soldiers.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers fell on hundreds of enemies.
The Kargil war was not just a boundary war, it was a part of every city and every village of India.
It was fought for those mothers and sisters whose young sons, brothers and sisters were fighting against the enemy in Kargil.
The youngsters who had not even touched their hands for the wedding, they fought this war, they fought against the brave young sons who felt like a young man again, they fought with their father's fingers and those who had not yet learnt to walk.
It is because of the sacrifices made by them that today India can speak to the world with a strong sense.
We launched the MyGov campaign on 26th July just a few months after our government came to power in 2014.
We have launched this website to connect every citizen with development and to increase their participation in democracy.
And today, a year later, I am happy to say that nearly two crore citizens have visited the MyGov website.
Nearly 5. 5 lakh citizens registered their responses, and more than 50,000 citizens took time to register their information on PMO APPLICATIONS.
Is it right that such people have difficulty in taking out the ticket of train .
Though this thing looks small on top of it, the government didn't even notice it.
However, on the issue of Akhilesh Ji, the government took a serious note of it and today a separate arrangement has been made for the reservation of tickets for our disabled brides and sisters.
There are new logos, two lines, programme policies and many positive information is received on MyGov.
There is a feeling that new heights are flowing in the governance system.
A new consciousness is being realized.
MyGov suggestions have been issued to me on the 15th of August that I may take up any issue in my speech.
Sumitra Raghavchari from Chennai has given a lot of suggestions.
I believe that this is a good idea for the citizens of the country to come up with issues for this thing in my speech on August 15.
I am sure you will make good suggestions.
I want to take care of one thing and I want it to reach you.
I don't want to preach to anyone. I don't intend to refrain from the responsibility of the central government, the state government or local autonomous bodies.
Just two days ago, I saw a sight of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, that scooter driver was wandering for about ten minutes in a critical condition.
Hoshakote Akshay from Bengaluru, Amay Joshi from Pune, Sunna Kakunje from Murbidri in Karnataka, and many others have expressed their concern over this issue.
Every four minutes a person dies in road accidents.
However, I appeal to the parents that be it the kids or the kids who are running their kids, they will get the teachings of 'Charchaki' and 'Security Building' from the households and the parents should pay attention to it.
In this regard, the government has formulated a lot of new policies, initiatives and initiatives to train citizens on road safety, be it road tracking systems or be it speedy relief to the accident victims.
We are going to introduce the Transport and Security Bill keeping in mind all these things.
We are thinking of taking several important steps in the coming days to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
This scheme is Cashless Treatment - from Gurgaon, Jaipur, Baroda, from Yeth to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia.
This means that the immediate medical assistance will be provided to those injured in the accident within 50 hours of the accident. Whether it is nearly funded to take immediate care of the accident or not, we will give priority to the treatment of the injured by removing all the precautions.
Toll-free telephone number 1033 will be available across the country for providing information about accidents.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that there will be no accident at the root, because the life of one person and everyone is even more important.
Sometimes I say that the worker should become a worker.
During the last few days, I realized that I had to talk to you about it.
But how can we bring about consciousness in the work done
Vijay Biswal has demonstrated how his interests and art capabilities are in harmony with his work.
It is likely to be spoken about his picture and I got to know about one more thing.
The entire team of government officials from Madhya Pradesh and Harda district, a different task organised by the Sangh has touched my heart.
I liked his work and when I heard that these officers started their operations, you would feel that something else is different.
However, a new turn to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is an important thing in this regard.
There is a village named Kesharla near Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh .
The people of this village constructed toilets in a mission mode.
Now no one in this village is going to open for toilets and when the work of constructing toilets is completed then the village of Kasherla has celebrated Anandotsav as a festival.
This is an excellent example of how the values of social life are changing, the mindset of the people is changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
From Guwahati, Bhavesh Deka has written about the questions related to the North-East.
However, the people of the North-Eastern region are active.
He will visit the village and interact with the officials of the administration there, people will interact with the representatives and the citizens.
They will know their difficulties and they will do whatever is possible by the central government to solve these difficulties.
A good effort, an attempt to move eastwards from Delhi, is the East Policy.
My dear countrymen, the success of the Mangal Mission is a matter of pride and happiness for all of us.
We are aware of this news but we are not aware of it.
I would like to urge the IAS officers of the government to go to a school, college and interact with the students there for two to four hours a week.
This work is difficult but we have to do it.
Do not fall prey to the study of children so that there is no electricity during the examination.
There will be electricity if there is a small business in the village, if there is a need to start an industry.
In some cases, we have to visit other villages to charge mobile phones.
We will definitely do this, we have started it.
Today, I felt like talking to you about different topics from Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes to all of you.
You must send your suggestions and new ideas for August 15th.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
I used to feel that there is something less.
We used to listen to a lot of things, we used to talk about it once again in a very simple atmosphere, in the form of a self-respect among the families of 130 crore Indians.
Sometimes these things were inspiring for our people.
You must have imagined the period of vacation.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month - at 11 a.m.
Every moment I felt that I would miss something.
And whenever I speak Mann Ki Baat, I speak alone. And that word may be mine, voice may be mine, but that story is yours, it is yours, it is yours, it is yours, it is yours, it is yours, it is yours, it is yours.
I was just using my words and my speeches.
There was a feeling of complete vacancy in the mind.
Once you come to mind, now the elections are over, you should come and talk about four things in your mind immediately.
But afterwards they thought that no
It is our Sunday programme and it should continue to do the same.
But this Sunday brought a lot of wait.
Small, simple, simple and light things are also causing change in the lives of the society.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new energy, a pure consciousness and in a sense, we have to move forward by giving strength to the consciousness and energy of a New India.
In the last few months, there have been many messages in which many people have said that Mann Ki Baat is being missed.
Whenever I read this message, I feel extremely sad.
This is my journey from 'Aham' to 'Vayam'.
This silent dialogue with you for me was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Several people have asked a lot about why I went to Kedarnath in the Dhammadhumi of the elections.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will also have the curiosity to know the answers to these questions.
The only thing I can say is that the compulsions given to Mann Ki Baat had created a feeling of slight vacancy in my mind and perhaps I would have got the opportunity to fill this pocket in the valleys of Kedar.
Just as many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar Yatra, your effort to strengthen a positive thing and I feel relentlessly at your words.
The letters that come in for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are different from the routine of the day-to-day government.
Sometimes even the letters you have sent will inspire me in a way.
In some cases, the task of laying the foundation stone for my thought process is something that tells you.
The challenges faced by the country and the society make me understand from the people.
At the same time, people are saying that what is the answer to these problems.
I was surprised to know that in the newspapers, people ask for their problems and what is the answer to them.
Answers to the synonyms of questions, in some or the other new ideas, direct or indirectly.
Mann Ki Baat is like a gesture for the country and the society.
Today, my heart is filled with joy.
Last time I had said this thing that when we met in three-four months, some people had given a political meaning, they had said, Oh, Modi ji has so much confidence and he has so much confidence.
This self-confidence was not of Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your faith.
You all took the form of trust.
And that is why I had very easily said in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will come to talk to you.
You have left me here and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
In this spirit, let us begin the series of Mann Ki Baat as before.
The movement was not confined to the prison.
There was a heart attack in the minds of people.
The democracies felt a kind of stir in their minds.
We don't know what is hungry when we get food from time to time.
In the same way, they understand the importance of democratic rights.
During the Emergency, every citizen of the country felt that he had taken something away.
Even if someone snatched away from the fact that we never used it, the same sufferings and sufferings occurred.
Some arrangements have been made in the event of India and democracy has come here.
There is also a need to move towards social order.
Laws and regulations are also required, rights and duties are also being discussed.
But India can proudly say that for us, there is a value of democracy that has been greater than the law and the rules.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage, our tradition.
And with this legacy, we have become a child.
Therefore, the country had sacrificed a complete election for the protection of democracy, not for ourselves but for our own good.
We have easily adopted the precious democracy that we have attained.
More than 61 crore people cast their votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
But if the world's favorites are there then I say that if one leaves China then more people than the population of any other country have the right to vote in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the total population of Europe.
You can imagine how much resources and human resource would be required to complete this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and staff worked day and night to overcome the elections.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have fulfilled their responsibilities to make this great achievement of democracy a success.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also worked hard.
You can imagine the scale of the total election.
All the voters had made all this database so that not a single voter should be deprived of his right to vote for all eligible voters.
In remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, we were setting up a polling station for a single female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel for two days to reach the remotest places.
Besides, there was a need to showcase the pride in this election.
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission and everyone involved in this election process and bow down to the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you must have heard from me that I have a request for books and not books.
We can replace the flowers with books by welcoming them.
On hearing this, people have started welcoming the books at many places.
Someone recently gifted me a book titled 'Premchand Ki Popular Kahania'.
I liked this gift a lot.
However, I could not get a lot of time but during the journey I got the opportunity to save some of his stories once again.
Premchand has made a real picture of the society in his stories and when he was reading it he had to produce the picture of that time before his eyes.
Every detail he wrote, every thing becomes alive.
His stories seem to have incorporated the feelings of overall India.
While reading the story of 'Nasha', he wrote, I myself started asking questions about economic imbalances in the society.
I remembered my youth.
Our youngsters used to debate overnight on the economic evils of the society.
The sensitivity of a child, the immense sensitivity of our lives, the maturity of our thoughts at such a young age.
The 4-5-year-old Hamid, when he comes to our country with a thrill in the fair, really reaches the heights of human sensitivity and in this episode, he will finally become a passionate reader.
In this story, a lively picture of the life of a poor farmer can be read.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village situated in the thick forests of Idukki.
Primary teacher P.
Murlidharan and P.
V.
Chinnathampi or both of them started this library with tireless hard work.
There was a time when these two books were tied to books and they used to take books from their backs in our villages in the forest.
Today, this library is working to give a new direction to everyone along with the tribal children.
In Gujarat, this mission of 'Gujarat' was a great success.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this campaign and read books.
In today's digital era, during the time of Google Guru, I urge you to keep books for a while in your daily routine.
My dear countrymen, the people of our country are not only thinking about the present time but they also feel like thinking about the challenges of the future.
When I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I remember that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Vijay Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related challenges.
Water is like a mother, and the blessings of the mother should be blessed and the grace of the mother like water should be restored on us.
Due to the deficiency of water every year there is drought in many parts of the country.
We save only eight per cent of the water and therefore we need to solve this problem.
Just like all of us have solved many other problems with public participation, Jan Shakti, similarly, one hundred and thirty crore countrymen will find solutions to the problem of water with all their capabilities, with all their cooperation and with determination.
Keeping this in mind that the importance of water is the highest, now the new Jal Shakti Ministry is being set up in the country.
This will enable faster decision making on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to do something a little bit smoothly.
I wrote letters to Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans across the country.
In order to save water, to store water, do not drop drops of rain or save rain water, the village heads should hold a meeting with the village heads to ensure that rain water is saved.
It has been resolved to save every drop of water in villages and villages and save rain water.
In today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people of this place have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans and Sarpanches for their active participation in saving water.
Several seminars across the country have made a similar pledge for water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of that village are now competing for the construction of a water temple in their villages.
I have already said that collective efforts will have very positive results.
There cannot be only one specific formula for water conservation across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But the goal is the same and that is water conservation and water conservation.
Work is underway to improve the drainage lines in Punjab.
These projects will solve the problem of water conservation.
The lives of the people of the village are changing as water waste is being prepared in Thimaipalli in Telangana.
Small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a big change.
I had read about the collective efforts made in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women came together to revive the river Nag.
I also read that the women in Garhwal have been working together in the field of rainwater harvesting in a very good manner.
This kind of effort is being made, I believe that it is impossible when we all work together and firmly together.
Water will be saved when everybody participates in the work of water conservation.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have a request of three things to my countrymen.
My first appeal is - just as the countrymen have made the Swachhata campaign a movement, similarly, we should start a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is the prasad given to God.
Earlier they used to say that the touches of iron are made of gold.
I say that water is a perennial, and a new life is created by the touch of water.
An awareness campaign should be started to save every drop of water .
We should make the society aware and connect the society.
I urge you all to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar on the birthplace of revered Bapu Ji then he would have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu.
That is why I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then he must see the storage of water.
Let us make a list of maximum water conservation related methods and encourage people to conserve water.
You can share your information on JanshaktiForJalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude for one more thing.
The President of many countries from all over the world, the Prime Minister, the dignitaries and the general public, have told me through a Twitter about how Yoga Day has been celebrated in your country.
On that day, the whole world looked like a happy family.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great work of social service.
Wouldn't you like to acknowledge such service providers with recognition
The Prime Ministers Award for outstanding contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga was announced in 2019.
This thing is inspiring.
Now the topic of Yoga is going on, Indians are not lagging behind in this area.
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger have also been honoured and dedicated to Yoga for the past few decades.
My dear countrymen, this journey of yours is beginning today and I will wait for your advice but I will continue to wait for your new emotions, new experiences, new resolutions and new strengths.
If you come, you will continue to meet and talk.
I listen to your feelings and keep in mind.
Sometimes I try to live that feeling.
Your blessings should be so blessed.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again I will meet at Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the terrorist attacks in Pulwama, there has been a deep sense of sadness in the hearts of the people of our country.
Condolences to the brave soldiers and their families who have laid down their lives.
The feelings of intense anguish in our hearts and minds are inherent in the feelings of this kind of terrorist violence. The same feelings are inherent in the minds of every countrymen and in the minds of humanity across the globe.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always shown unparalleled courage and valour.
They have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities for peace.
He has done a very good job to give a befitting reply to the attackers in their own language.
You must have seen how action was taken within a hundred hours.
Ram Niranjan ji, father of Bhagalpur martyr Ratan Thakur of Bihar, who showed his courage in such a sad event, is inspiring for all of us.
We will send our second son to the army to fight against the enemy and if necessary we will fight ourselves.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Meenaji, wife of the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, Sunna Sahu.
He has also decided to recruit one of his identities in the CRPF.
When the martyr Vijay Shoren, who was wrapped in a tricolor in Gumla village in Jharkhand, was killed, his innocent son said that he too would be recruited in the army.
The courage shown by these illegitimate children today is the feeling of every small child in India.
This feeling is visible from the houses of our heroes and brave martyrs.
There is no exception to one of our brave martyrs that their family is not an exception.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya or the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of a million martyr Hemraj, the story of every family of the martyred soldiers is inspiring.
We will not need to look at the old events of history to know what is sacrifice and penance.
These are the examples that are going on in front of our eyes.
These examples are a source of inspiration for India's bright future.
My dear countrymen, we have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for several years.
Therefore, it is natural for the countrymen to have curiosity and curiosity about it.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Onkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka, expressed happiness that the National War Memorial has been completed and completed.
It is a memorial that will preserve the legend of the great valour of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to build such an inspirational monument in the country.
We decided to set up a National Soldiers Memorial and started direct work.
Tomorrow, on 25 February, this National Military Memorial will be handed over to millions and millions of our countrymen.
The country will do this simple job of repaying your debts.
This new memorial has been built near the India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyot Part where the heart of Delhi is called.
I am confident that such a sacred task will be the vision of the people of the country to visit this National Soldier Memorial.
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of gratitude for the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice after Independence.
The construction of this memorial will showcase the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on four focused cycles, from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom.
The glow of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyred soldiers.
The protective cycle that follows is reflecting security.
There are queues of dense trees in this cycle.
These trees are the symbols of the soldiers and they are giving a message of faith to the citizens of the country, every incident is on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Someone will come here to know about the valour of these brave soldiers who have laid down their lives for the country so that they can keep the country safe, keep alive and develop the country.
Our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces are invaluable in terms of their great and invaluable contribution to the development of the country.
I would like to express our gratitude to the men and women police personnel who are continuously working for our security.
I hope you all will visit the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
It will also inspire others to visit this holy place and they will also be eager to visit this holy place.
This time when I was reading the responses from you people, I was reminded of the painful reactions of Shri Ashish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He wrote that on 3rd March, 1900, the British had attacked Birsa Munda.
And it is a matter of Yoga that on 3rd March it is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata.
Both have come from different family backgrounds but both of them have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
Tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, in a way, to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have brightened not only Jharkhand but the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youngsters can be named as inspirational personalities as guides then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
Birsa Munda was lying lying lying lying lying lying lying on the ground and was caught by the British.
Do you know why the British had to accept the path of such mischief to capture Munda
The reason for this was the fear of British Munda who created such a big empire.
Lord Birsa Munda, with the help of his traditional blessings, had shattered the British government with guns and cannons.
In fact, if people get such an inspirational leadership, then collective will power becomes stronger than the powers of the armed forces that are in front of the enemy.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
They did everything in their shortcomings.
In the dark life of the deprived and the exploited ones the light of sunrise has been brought .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life for 25 years of age.
Like Birsa Munda, the son of Mother India has been born in every part of the country.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifices, valour and sacrifices of these great people did not reach the new generation.
If a personality like Lord Birsa Munda has made us aware of the existence then a personality like Jamshedji Tata has created big institutions in the country.
Jamshedji Tata knew that India must become a hub of science, technology and industry for a bright future.
Moreover, he established several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekanand Ji had once visited the ship during their visit to the United States and discussed various topics.
The foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Science was laid by this interaction.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarjibhai Desai was born on 29 February.
You all are well aware that this date comes once in four years.
Simple, peaceful personality Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is also the record of presenting the budget most of the time in Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India during the difficult times when the country was in a crisis of democracy.
Morarjibhai Desai humbled himself in the movement against the imposition of democracy.
He had to calculate a huge price in his old age.
The government of that time put them in a hurry.
In 1977, when Janta Party won the elections, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
Accordingly, the fundamental rights granted in accordance with Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution shall not be abrogated even during the period of enforcement.
Morarji Bhai had amended the Emergency Lawns, 1975, to ensure that there should not be any revival in the future.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, people were very curious about the Padma Awards.
We feel that the people who work at the grassroots level should be honored with selflessness and their work.
Many people have been working hard to bring about positive changes in the lives of people in different ways.
The people who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and service to the nation, above all, are Karmyogis.
These are the real activists who are far from the world of fame, who do not have the privilege of getting their names or not.
He believes in work: Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam, the message of singing, is in a way a direct world.
I want to talk to you about such people today.
Friends, these rare paintings have been doing the job of reaching out to the new generation.
Abdul Ghafoor, the artefact of Tree of Life, was a gift to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the standards of the Padma awards, Shabbir Sayeed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gomati.
The way he has dedicated his entire life to the service of the mother cow, his work is different.
Even at the age of centuries, many people in the world are training Yoga.
Till now, he has made 5,500 people Yoga teachers and Jamuna Tudu, famously known as Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has done two hands with the Timber Mafia and the Nuclears and not only saved 50 hectares of forests from devastation.
Due to the hard work of Jamuna Baiji, now the villagers of that area plant 18 trees after the birth of every child in their homes.
He has worked towards women empowerment and how farming can be beneficial.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women in our region to join the Self Help Groups to become economically self-reliant.
This change in the list of award winners is a new image of India that is changing in a way.
My dear countrymen, the experience of confronting one heart has recently come to me and I will tell you here today.
Wherever I go to the country today, it is my endeavor that I get the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
Brothers and sisters, Nearly 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I have noticed that this scheme is transforming the lives of the poor.
If a poor person cannot afford medicines, then we must inform him about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the season of examinations in schools will start now.
The examinations of Class  and II will begin in the next few weeks by taking up examinations by different boards across the country.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the parents and teachers of all the students who are examining.
A few days ago, a massive programme called Pariksha Pe Charcha was organised in Delhi and Town Hall was organised as a programme.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at the Pariksha Pe Charcha.
This will definitely benefit the students.
All the students, their teachers, parents can watch the entire recording of this programme on YouTube and convey my best wishes to all my examiners for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, there is talk of India and there is no talk of festivals or festivals.
This is because there is a tradition of thousands of years old culture and traditions that have benefitted us.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I had got the opportunity to spend some time with the Divyang brothers and sisters of Kashi.
And it was a pleasant surprise to hear a copy of it.
The way I speak in Mann Ki Baat, those youths with disabilities have imitated the same methods.
I felt immensely sorry that people just listen to Mann Ki Baat and leave it alone.
I was really impressed by the power of that disabled young man.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through Mann Ki Baat is a unique experience for me.
In a way, I interact with millions and millions of families every month through radio.
Often, while talking to all of you, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts on telephone, I feel that all of you have considered me as a member of your family.
This is a matter of great pleasure for me.
Friends, Election is one of the biggest festivals of democracy.
In the next two months, all of us will be present in the dawn of elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election.
Mann Ki Baat will be the last Sunday of the month of May, respecting a robust democratic tradition.
This means that the month of March, the month of April and the entire month of May will go for three months.
After the election of all our emotions of this period, with a new confidence and with the strength of your blessings, once again we will start a programme to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat and will continue to interact with you for many years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us - 'Kayakave Kailas' means that while working hard, it is like living in the residence of Lord Shiva and Kailashadham.
His reputation was such a scholar who had a unique influence on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He offered his entire life to provide food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
I have been fortunate to receive the blessings of revered Swamiji several times.
In 2007, for the centenary year celebrations of Shri Sri Shivakumar Swami ji, our former President Dr.
Kalam Saheb had recited a poem for revered Swami ji.
This poem of In Giving, You Receive Happiness Alliance Will Bless, All Your Actions, Dr Kalam Saheb reflects the life and mission of Siddhganga Math.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
25th January was the founding day of the Election Commission, which is celebrated as National Voters Day. People all over the world are surprised to see the massive level of elections being held in India and it is natural for every countrymen to take pride in the Election Commission considering the skills that the Election Commission manages.
Every citizen of India who is a registered voter in our country.
There is no fault in ensuring that a registered voter will get an opportunity to cast his vote.
In Himachal Pradesh, the polling stations are being set up at a height of 15,000 feet from the sea level, while in remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands, arrangements are made for voting.
Just imagine, for a voter.
When I hear these things, it is natural to take pride in the Election Commission.
This is the beauty of our democracy so that the Election Commission employees go to far-flung areas to ensure that they get the opportunity to exercise their right to vote keeping in mind the voters.
I appreciate the Election Commission, which has consistently tried to strengthen our democracy.
I would urge the young generation to register as voters if they are eligible to cast their votes.
At the same time, it is my duty to cast a lot of votes.
We must realise this responsibility.
This is our attitude, our tendency.
It should be our culture.
I urge the renowned person of the country to join hands in registering voters or make people aware by running a campaign for voting.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and our participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done something amazing and unforgettable for humanity.
Our country is multi-purpose.
One of these great men was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire nation celebrated her birth anniversary.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You are aware that many rooms and buildings were closed in the Red Fort since independence.
The closed rooms of the Red Fort have now been converted into a very beautiful museum, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army
The museum dedicated to Yad-e-Jallian and 1857 ATEN FIFTECH, Indias First War of Independence and this entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
Every brick in this museum has a smell of our glorious history.
They inspire us to see the legends of the heroes of our freedom struggle in the museum.
At the same venue, the British Rajvatin had been driven by the brave son of Mother India-Carnal Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurubaksingh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I used to visit the memories associated with Netaji in the Red Fort, in the Kranti Mandir, then the members of Netaji's family visited me a very special cap.
Netaji used to portray that cap.
I gave it to the hat museum so that the people coming there can see the hat and take inspiration from it.
In fact, our heroism and patriotism need to continue in different ways to the new generation.
A month ago, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
In a programme, the tricolor was fluttering at the same place where Netaji Subhash Bose had fluttered the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the Tricolor broke out in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because here is the tradition of 15th August.
On this occasion, 75 years of formation of Azad Hind Government were completed.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled association.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
With many brilliant announcements like 'You kill me, I will give you Azadi Dunga', Netaji took a place in the heart of every Indian.
For many years, there was a demand for bringing all the files related to Netaji and I am glad that we could do this thing.
I remember Netaji's family who had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together, we made a lot of comments about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir related to Babasaheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that is Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio connectivity to people as an important medium, similarly Netaji too was very busy with radio and he had chosen radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu started Azad Hind Radio and through radio he used to interact with the soldiers and people of the Azad Hind Fauj.
Subhash Babu had a different style of commencement of Radio Communication.
First of all, he used to say - 'Dhis is Subhash Chandra Bose Speaking to You Over the Azad Hind Radio' and so on, there was a new zeal, a new energy movement in the audience.
I was told that these radio stations used to broadcast weekly reports which were given in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, West and Urdu.
The Radio Station is being run by the resident M.
Vyas played a very important role.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programme gave a big boost to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been set up in this revolutionary temple.
An attempt has been made to present the most attractive methods of Indian art and culture.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and there are over 450 centuries old paintings and artworks.
The Museum has exhibited excellent artworks from great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravivarma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Gemini Rai, Saloj Mukherjee.
And I would like to specially urge you all to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You must be wondering that art is being discussed here and I am telling you about the excellent artwork of Gurudev Tagore.
Till now, we will recognize Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician.
But I would like to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on many topics.
He has also drawn pictures of animals and birds, he has drawn many beautiful pictures of nature and not only this, he has also worked to bring many human characters to Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that he did not give any name to most of his paintings.
They believed that their painters would themselves understand the meaning of that painting and would understand the meaning of their message from the paintings.
Their painting exhibitions are also held in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will visit Kranti Mandir to see their paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of Saints.
Our saints have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thought and actions.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give a big message in a very short span of time.
He had said that whenever a patriarch of Hajo Ketan goes to the caste, if he does not get involved then the leaves below the leaves and afterwards there is nothing in the bottom of the leaves but when the entire tree is destroyed, the humans are misguided by different races and human beings are not there.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, then it is not right to share it on the basis of caste, creed and other social basis.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Through his messages, Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life.
It would not be wrong to say here that he explained the true meaning of labour to the world.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
I would like to urge the students to take interest in the space programme and think of something different and think beyond the sky, I appreciate this idea and especially the message given by them to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad when I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has made an important contribution to India's space programme.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching out to space.
This is the Kalam-Set Launch made by our students on 24th January.
In Odisha, sounding rockets made by university students have established many records.
The number of space missions that have been launched since independence till 2014, almost the same number of space missions have been started in the last four years.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites in the same spacecraft.
We will soon showcase Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technologies in a better way to protect livelihoods and property.
Whether it is cyclone or rail or road safety, space technologies are helping better.
Our fishermen brothers have been given naval devices, which are helpful in economic upliftment along with their security.
We are using space technologies to further enhance public service delivery and accountability.
Under the Housing for All scheme, about 40 lakh houses have been geo-tagged in 23 states.
Besides, the Geo Tag has also lost about three and a half crore assets under MNREGA.
Our satellites have become a symbol of the country's growing power.
Our contribution to our excellent relations with many countries of the world is immense.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has given a visit to our neighbouring friendly nations for development.
Through our unlimited competitive launch service, India is launching not only the developing country but also the satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars for children are always very attractive.
Our space programme gives the children the opportunity to move ahead with the limits that they seem impossible to go beyond.
Our vision is to inspire and explore newer stars while watching the stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that the one who plays will open it. And here in Khelo India, a lot of youngsters and young sportspersons have emerged.
In January, about 6,000 players participated in 18 sports at the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
When a sportsperson performs at the local level, he will do his best in the world.
Sportspersons from every state have performed well at their respective levels in Khelo India.
Many medal winners are inspiring for their lives.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
The captain of Maharashtra's 21-year-old women's clothing team, Sonali Helvy, is a resident of Satara and a very young girl has gone and encouraged her brother and her mother Sonali's skills.
It is often seen that girls are not encouraged in sports like kabaddi.
In spite of this, Sonalin chose cotton and performed excellently.
The 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw of Asansol is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshata Baswani Kamati Hin, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won a gold medal in weightlifting.
He has a farmer in Belgaum.
When we talk about building India then the resolution of Youth Power and New India is a New India.
These are telling the stories of Khelo India that the contribution of not only big cities but also small towns, villages, towns, youngsters and young sports talents to build a New India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about the prestigious beauty contest.
The name of this event is Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya.
People are making beautiful paintings by keeping their toilets clean and by making them colorful, we will get to see pictures of clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all the Sarpanchs and village heads to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
You must put all your clean beautiful toilets on social media including Mylzzatghar.
Friends, On 2nd October, 2014, we started our journey of making the country clean and open defecation free.
Today, India is moving towards Open Defecation Free India, much ahead of 2nd October, 2019, so that I can pay my tributes to my fathers on his 150th birth anniversary.
A resident of Himachal Pradesh, Ankul Sharma has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exam warriors.
Ankul ji, thank you for presenting this issue.
For many fairs, the first part of the year remains a part of the examination.
Students, from their parents to teachers, all are engaged in examination related work.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
Today, I would have liked to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat, but you will be happy to note that after two days, on 29th January at 11 a.m. on the occasion of Pariksha Pe Charcha programme, parents and teachers will also participate in this programme.
And many foreign students will also participate in the event.
I will definitely put forward some of these ideas and suggestions in the Town Hall programme.
You can also see the same live broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire nation pays homage to the martyrs.
Let us also pay our homage to the martyrs for two minutes.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
The year 2018 is slated to end.
And then it benefits the experiences, and it also creates confidence in selecting.
What can we do, which will transform our lives and contribute to the society and the country
I convey my best wishes to all of you for 2019.
All of you must have decided to remember the year 2018.
It is also important that the year 2018 will be remembered as a country as the strength of our 1. 3 billion people.
And it is also a matter of pride for all of us.
In 2018, the world's largest Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme was launched.
Electricity reached every village of the country.
The world's prestigious institutions have recognized that India is working towards eradicating poverty at a record pace.
With the unwavering resolve of the countrymen, the coverage of cleanliness is moving forward from 95 to 95.
For the first time since independence, the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort on the 75th day of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
The country received the world's tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who made the country united.
The country's name was raised in the world.
Champion of the Earth Award was given to the nation.
India's efforts towards solar energy and climate change will get a place in the world.
The first meeting of the Global Solar Alliance was held in India.
Our collective efforts have led to an unprecedented growth in the rankings of Indias trade facilitation.
The country's defence capabilities were strengthened.
This year our country has successfully completed the nuclear triangle i. e.
The country's daughters travelled the world through the sea circumnavigation and the country was filled with pride.
Indias first climate began in Varanasi.
This is why revolution has started in the area of waterways .
The countrys longest railway line bridge was inaugurated, the first and the 100th Pakyong airport in Sikkim was inaugurated.
India has also won the 19-year-old world cup of cricket, the blind cricket world cup.
This year, India earned a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India also made good strides in the Para Asian Games.
If I talk about the collective endeavours of every Indian, then our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that 2019 will emerge.
This has been possible due to the relentless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we have met a few exceptional Indians in December this year.
On 19th December, Dr. Jahendran passed away in Chennai.
Dr. Jahendran is known as one of the cheapest treatments for the poor.
People say that he was a medical practitioner for the patients.
On this website, I have read a lot about the work that inspires their society.
Similarly, Sulagitinarasamma of Karnataka died on 25th December.
Earlier this year, he was honoured by Padmashri.
There are several persons like Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of the society.
While we are talking about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social initiatives taken by the doctors of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city provide free treatment to the poor by organizing camps.
Every month such shibirds are taken by the Heart Lung Critical Care here , in these camps the facility of free treatment of various diseases is available .
Today in every month hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps .
The excitement of these young doctors who are serving patients with selflessness is truly worthless.
Today, I am proud to say that it is because of collective efforts that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has succeeded.
Some people have told me that just a few days ago, more than three lakh people in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh had launched a cleanliness drive.
I'm just Thebetterindia.
I am sure that this will provide information to more and more people about our neighbours who are transforming the society.
It is easy to spread negativity.
However, several good things are happening around us in the society.
And this is being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important part of every society.
When sports are played, those who watch it also get energy.
We see a lot of things like fame, identity and dignity of sportspersons.
But sometimes there are many things that are bigger and bigger than the world.
I would like to tell you about Kashmir's daughter-in-law Nisar, who won the gold medal in the Karate Akya Kya event held in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanayana studied and practiced karate with hard work and chikati, learned brakes in it and proved himself.
I pray for the bright future of this countrymen.
Many congratulations and blessings to Hanaya.
Likewise, there was a lot of discussion among the media about the 16 year old Rajni daughter.
Rajani said that his father had made a lot of sacrifice and suffered a lot to reach here.
Jasmer Singh used to leave for work every morning before Rajni and his feelings were raised.
When Rajani expressed his desire to learn against the problem, the father collected all the resources and increased his enthusiasm.
Rajni had to use old gloves to practice hardships because his family had to face the economic situation.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni did not go out of the way.
She has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani for helping Rajni and enhancing her enthusiasm.
In the same month, a 20-year-old girl from Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian to travel in the world.
She used to run around 300 kilometers of cycles daily for 159 days.
You can imagine 300 kilometers of cycling everyday.
Her stubbornness of cycling is truly arbitrary.
Whether we get inspired by such achievements or not
Especially when my young friends hear about the phenomenon, they also get inspired to do something by crossing the barriers.
If you make a firm resolve, if you have the strength, then all the problems will automatically disappear.
No problem can be obstructed .
When we hear about such examples, we also get an inspiration every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, there will be several festivals like Lodhi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi in January.
On the occasion of all these festivals, if we see the colors of traditional dances in the country of Sanoran then somewhere Irodi will burn in the joy of Sugi.
After this the day slowly starts to grow and winter season starts .
Many congratulations to our farmer brothers and sisters who feed us.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is a spirit of unity in diversity in our festivals.
You can see how similar our festivals have been to nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different, individuals and communities are the same.
Excellent examples of our close relations with nature are festival-based calendars.
This includes not only the festivals of the year but also the information about the planets and constellations.
From this traditional calendar we get to know how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is .
According to the speed of the moon and the sun the festive dates are determined according to the moon and the sun calendar .
It depends on the calendar that is calculated .
Celebrations are also celebrated in many parts according to the status of stars.
Gudhikhowa, Chetichand, Ugadi are all celebrated as lunar calendars, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaisakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu are celebrated as sun calendars.
River and water conservation has a special significance in many of our festivals.
Chhath festival is a festival of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds.
Even on Makar Sankranti lacs of people take bath in the holy rivers .
Our festivals also teach us social values.
On the one hand, it has ancient significance, on the other hand, every festival is easily inspired by social brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to all of you in 2019 and wish you all the very best in the future.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture that we can take pride in and show pride to the entire world and one of these things is our Kumbh Mela.
People from India and abroad come there and are always associated with the Kumbh Mela.
During the Kumbh Mela, the oceans of faith and devotion are immersed.
Millions of people from within the country and abroad have gathered here in one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is imbibed and blossomed with our great cultural heritage.
This year, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organised in Prayagraj from January 15th. Perhaps you are eagerly waiting for it.
Saint-Mahatma has started reaching Prayagraj for Kumbh Mela since now.
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the footsteps of the magnificent cultural traditions of mankind so that we can imagine its global importance.
A few days ago, the Ambassador of many countries had come to see the preparations for the Kumbh.
At that time, the flag of several countries was hoisted at one time.
People from more than 150 countries are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj.
The divinity of the Kumbh will illuminate the magnificence of India in the entire world.
The Kumbh Congregation is an effective medium for its discovery and every person coming here feels differently.
This is a very big academic experience especially for the youth.
I myself had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I have seen that the preparations for Kumbh are going on in full swing.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
This year, emphasis is also being laid on cleanliness in Kumbh.
In the event of Kumbh, cleanliness will not only focus on cleanliness but its good message will reach far flung areas.
This year, the future Triveni will also be able to observe Akshayvat after the holy bath at Sangam.
This akshayvat, a symbol of the faith of the devotees, was shut down in a fort for many years, so the emotional ones could not see it despite their desires.
However, now the thresholds of this Akshayvat have been opened for all.
I would urge you that when you visit Kumbh Mela, you must upload some photos of the Kumbh Mela on social media and you will get inspired to visit this Kumbh Mela.
May this Kumbh of spirituality become the Mahakumbh of philosophy in India for Indians.
May this Kumbh of artistry become the Mahakumbh of creative powers too.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of curiosity in our countrymen regarding the 26th January Republic Day celebrations.
There is an unbreakable bond between revered Bapu and South Africa.
From South Africa, Mohn became Mahatma.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood firm against casteism.
He also established Finnics and Tolstoy Farms, from which the voice for peace and justice was raised throughout the world.
This year 2018, Nelson Mandela is also being celebrated as a Jan Shakti Year and is also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela is considered to be an ideal in the fight against casteism all over the world.
He was inspired and inspired by revered Bapu for so many years.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not just a source of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, just a few days ago, there was a DGP summit at Narmada in Gujarat, where the world's tallest statue is the Statue of Unity.
Detailed discussions were held on how steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
At the same time, I announced the opening of the Sardar Patel Awards for National Integration and in any way the awards will be given to those who contribute to national integration.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity unsettled.
Sardar Patel believed that India's true strength has been united in its diversity.
Respecting their feelings, we have been paying homage to them through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, a long period of his life in North India was his workplace and he laid down his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi Patna, Karmabhoomi, North India and the end of life in Nanded.
Thus, in a sense, the whole of India received his blessings.
If we look at his life, we can see a reflection of the entire India in it.
After the martyrdom of Father Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji gained the position of Guru in the nine-year-old Alphons.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice.
His personality was calm and straightforward, but whenever an attempt was made to smile the poor and the weak, whenever injustice was done to them, Guru Gobind Singh fought hard for the poor and the weak and therefore it is said that...
Twenty-five lakhs of boys and girls used to say that it is not right to demonstrate our strength by fighting against the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that it is the biggest service to alleviate human sufferings.
He was an excellent tricolor, as well as a masterpiece of many other languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country that are not discussed at large.
i. e. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).
I am working to promote safe and healthy habits of food.
India can prosper only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritious food for good health is the most important thing .
In this context, the Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley said that there is a need to facilitate FSS.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him for this initiative taken by him.
I would like to urge you all to join this initiative.
I would like to say that we should also participate in this thing and especially show these things to the children.
Education telling the importance of diet is important from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last edition of 2018 and I will meet again in 2019.
Life, be it individuals, nations or societies, inspiration is the foundation of the progress of that life.
Let us move ahead with this new inspiration, new zeal, new resolutions, new achievements and new heights.
On 3rd October, 2014, we started a journey together on the holy occasion of Vijaya Dashami through Mann Ki Baat.
One man was a shield driver.
There was nothing clothing on the dhaba for despair.
On the side of the road, he had constructed a tapari like a tapari.
There was a discussion on radio at that time.
It should reach far-flung areas of the country, from very far-flung villages to metro cities, from farmer brothers to young professionals.
Recently, AIR has conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen the implications of that survey, some of the implications are different, observable.
Of the people surveyed, about 70 of them are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat is a major contributor to increasing the positive spirit of the society.
This is a glimpse of the positive emotions of our countrymen.
Many people have also experienced that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of voluntary action.
There has been a change in the way people are coming forward with great zeal for social service.
I am very happy to see that Mann Ki Baat has made radio more popular now.
But radio is not the only medium in this journey.
Thank you very much for phone calls.
The apprehension that you have made is exactly the same.
However, if a leader was given a mic and millions of people listened to him then what else would he do
They studied which words were used again and again.
Those studying have concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I had started the Mann Ki Baat programme, I had decided that there should not be politics in it, there should not be any government support in it.
I have been inspired by you and you all for the sake of accomplishing this resolution.
It is evident that what are the expectations of the listeners from the letters published in front of every section of Mann Ki Baat, on-line notebooks, on-line telephone.
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain steady, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore countrymen will continue to live.
Writing letters from a remote place in the country, someone tells me that people should not bargain with small shopkeepers like us, auto rickshaw drivers and vegetable sellers.
Now a campaign like Selfie with Daughter can be started in a small village in the state of Haryana and it can spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government word.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
If you have to answer the question in a simple manner then you say that nothing is being prepared.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very comfortable job for me.
Because every time I get letters from people before Mann Ki Baat.
By calling this number, people record their message in their voices.
Before every part of Mann Ki Baat, it is my endeavour to save the maximum number of letters and comments.
Every moment, my countrymen have settled in my heart. And that is why whenever I read a letter, the situation of that journalist and his feelings become a part of my thoughts.
In such a scenario, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
In fact, it is my voice in Mann Ki Baat but all the examples, emotions and inspiration are from my countrymen.
There are millions of people in Mann Ki Baat whom I have not been able to name till now but these people send their letters and letters.
Efforts are also made to ensure that all those letters which cannot be replaced in Mann Ki Baat and those related departments should take care of their suggestions.
It is because of their hard work that Mann Ki Baat can reach the maximum number of people.
Each team of All India Radio prepares for transmission in different languages.
Some people hear the Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages spoken in style.
One by one, they become Narendra Modi for those 30 minutes.
I congratulate and thank them for their talent and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this programme in your local language.
However, many of the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat were taken up by the media.
There are several topics like cleanliness, road safety, narcotics free India, selfie with Daughter, which the media has developed innovative ideas and made it a campaign and has done a lot of work in that field.
Without our cooperation, Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Sometimes our prejudice also stands in the form of a huge crisis in communication .
Apart from accepting and reacting, I would like to give priority to understanding what the next person has to say.
Normally, there was talk of Communication Gaps between the elderly, the elderly and the daughters of Kumar Vyoga.
In fact, in most of the houses, the subject of talking to children and children is also limited.
In this there is discussion on the study of children or their habits as well as their internal lifestyle .
Whatever they are doing or how they think about it, whether they can learn something differently or not, I always try to do it.
In the end, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do a lot of things at one go.
I tell you - what is wrong with this
These youngsters have shown the courage to ask questions and dream big, the same youth have brought about this change.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram has written on MyGov that I should talk about the Constitution Day tomorrow, the 26th of November in Mann Ki Baat.
They say that this is a very special day because we have accepted the constitution that it is now 69 years old and we are going to enter in the 70th year.
Just imagine, within three years, these great personalities have created such a massive and comprehensive event.
The way these great people have created such a fast-growing draft, this work is still a good example of the management and productivity of the village.
The special feature of our Constitution is that rights and duties have been described in detail in detail.
The combination of these two will take the country forward in the lives of citizens.
If we respect and respect the rights of others then the protection of our rights will automatically be there. And similarly, if we follow our duties in the constitution then the protection of our rights will automatically be there.
I still remember that when India's democracy was 60 years old then in 2010, we had taken a privileged journey by placing an elephant in Gujarat.
Our efforts to create awareness among the youth about the Constitution and to inform them about the important aspects of the Constitution were memorable.
And let us ensure that Peace, Progress, Prosperity, Peace and Prosperity in our country is prosperous.
My dear countrymen, we can never forget the contribution of a great soul when it is discussed by the Rajya Sabha Committee.
He was a great man, a revered Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
What is democratic and how Parliamentary system is there is nothing new for India.
He had said that this freedom that we have attained after so much struggle is invaluable and we have to protect it to the last drop of our blood.
India First Ha Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv next year in 2019.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the society the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony.
All State Governments and Union Territories have also been directed to celebrate this event in a big way.
In this way, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the world.
At that time I remembered Lakhpat Saheb Guruvdar.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, this guerrilla suffered huge losses.
However, the way the state government has worked with the help of the local people in this direction, the way it has done the work of restoration is still going to be an ideal.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to construct the Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit that holy place of Guru Nanak Devji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
But this journey of ours will continue.
The more people will be connected to all of us, the more our journey will be better and it will make everyone happy.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what do I get due to Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October, 2018
On 31st October is the birth anniversary of our lad Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and every year, the youth of the country has been able to run for the Run for Unity.
I urge all of you to participate in this race for UN in such large numbers.
Approximately six months before independence, on 27th January, 1947, a photograph of the world's famous International Monthly Time was published on the page of the magazine Sardar Patel.
This was the map of an India that was divided into several parts.
At that time more than 550 institutions were in the country.
Even though the juice of the British in India was over, they were trying to break this country into several parts and then leave the country.
Times used to write that India is facing threats like partition, violence, pricing, inflation and power politics.
He further wrote the Times: If anyone has the capability to encircle the country and to fill the wounds then it will be Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This news of Time was going to open several other aspects of the life of the Iron Man.
How he did the rescue operations after the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s, how he gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha.
He brought about merger of all institutions in India.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad or Travancore or Rajasthan's royalty Sardar Patel's ideological maturity and strategic skills, we can see India together today.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for seeing this nation and our Mother India bound by unity.
On 31st October this year, Sardar Patel's birth anniversary will be even more special. On that day, paying homage to Sardar Patel, we will dedicate the statue of Unity to the nation.
Built on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, the height of the statue is double the height of the Statue of Liberty statue of the United States.
This statue is the world's tallest skyscraper.
Every Indian will feel proud that the world's tallest effigy is in India.
Sardar Patel, who was with the land, will now enhance the beauty of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, Yesterday we have celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when the Indian Army personnel landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the Khore from the fugitives.
This historic event is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old book by the great army officer of India, Sam Manikshaw.
He was reminded of the period when Field Marshal Manikshaw was a Colonel.
On 31st October, the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
The Prime Minister paid homage to Indira ji.
My dear countrymen, no one likes sports
In the world of sports, spirit, strength, skill, stamina are all important.
The country's youth who have these qualities will not only make progress in sectors like economy, science and technology, but will also flag off the sports.
Our Para Athletes, who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018, got the opportunity to visit.
India has won a total of 72 medals in the event and has won a new record and has enhanced Indias honour.
I am fortunate to meet all these talented para athletes personally and congratulate them.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You will be happy to know that our youngsters have done the best ever in the Youth Olympics 2018.
We won three more medals in Mix Types besides 13 medals.
You must remember that India's performance in this year's Asian Games was also very good.
See how many times I have used the best, most glorious words to speak for a few minutes.
This is the story of Indian sports, which is reaching new heights day by day.
India is recording not only in sports but also in those areas which were never thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won the Gold Medal in Athletics for the Country at the 2018 Asian Para Games.
They are Divyangjans from birth.
When he was eight years old, he had a legacy.
Then he took eight years to an orphanage.
After abandoning orphanages, life driven drivers worked as a Veterinary Veterinary Carrier to clean the DTC bus and lay the roadways in Delhi.
Today, Narayana is winning Indias Gold in International Competitions.
Not only this, India has never won an Olympic medal either at the Senior or Geographical level in Judo.
But Tababi Devi won the Judot Silver medal in the Youth Olympics and created history.
Tababi Devi, a 16 year old sportsperson, lives in a village in Manipur.
Their elders are labourers and mothers are selling fish.
Many a time had come for his family that he had no money for food.
Even in such a situation, the morale of Tababi Devi has not diminished.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable such stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson and his stubbornness is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organised the FIFA 2017 World Cup under 17 years.
The entire world appreciated the successful sportspersonship.
A new record has been written in the number of visitors in the FIFA Under Saventin World Cup .
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football in different stadiums of the country and increased the enthusiasm of young sportspersons.
This year, India is fortunate to host the Mens Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup is scheduled to be held in November 2018 and will be held till December 16th.
Every Indian, be it sports or sports or be it juice or hockey, has an intimacy in his mind.
The history of India in Hockey has been written in gold.
Earlier, India had won gold medals in several tournaments and once India was a World Cup winner.
India has also given hockey to many great sportspersons.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in the world, the story of hockey will remain incomplete without this great sportsperson of India.
Hockey's wonderful Major Dhyan Chand is known all over the world.
After that, he has travelled a long way from Balwinder Singh Sinier, Leslie Glodius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, the sportspersons of Team India are inspiring the new generation of hockey due to their hard work and dedication.
There is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts to face adventure.
He visited Bhubaneswar and encouraged not only Indians but other associations.
During this time along with enjoying sports you can also see the Sun Temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and several world famous sightseeing and holy places along with Chilka Lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Mens Hockey Team for this competition and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with them for their support.
I also convey my best wishes to all the teams coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kind of people who are serving and serving for the social work, these are inspiring and encouraging for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, today we are moving forward to do this thing with new hopes, new zeal and new dreams.
A few days ago, I had gone to a programme where a portal has been launched, its name is Self Four Society, MyGov and the country's IT and Electronics Industry have started encouraging our employees to provide them such opportunities by encouraging them to take up social initiatives.
Every Indian will be proud to see the enthusiasm and intimacy he has for this work.
From IT to Society, I am not there, we are not egos, we are not adults, it is the fragrance of the journey of the entire world.
If someone is teaching children then someone is teaching senior citizens, if someone is engaged in cleanliness then someone helps the farmers. And there is no desire to do all this but it is a selfless feeling of dedication and determination.
A young man learnt a wheelchair basketball to help the Divyangjans wheelchair basketball team.
This spirit is dedication and this is an inspiring initiative for a specific task.
Wouldn't any Indian feel proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was looking at the suggestions made by the people for Mann Ki Baat then I got to see a fascinating comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on Mygov, Please tell us that in Mann Ki Baat, the customs and traditions of many tribes of India are the best examples of coexistence with nature.
We need to learn from them how we need to adopt their traditions of sustainable development.
Manish ji, I would like to compliment you all for keeping this topic in mind.
This is a topic that inspires us to see our glorious history and culture and today the entire world, especially the West, is discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Though our India Year is not tackled by this problem, but we only have to take a brief look at our rich history and traditions and especially understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Having a co-operation agreement with nature has been part of our tribal culture.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship the trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribal communities of central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship Pimpal and Arjun trees.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Vishnoi community has shown us the path of environmental protection.
In particular, they are willing to sacrifice their lives for the protection of trees but they do not approve of the loss of one tree.
Arunachal Pradesh claims to have links with Mishmi tigers.
They consider them as brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland wilderness is seen as the protector of forests .
People from the heritage communities of Maharashtra consider tigers as guests and for them the existence of tigers is prosperous.
It is a belief among the Coal community in central India that their luck is linked to the tiger and if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will have to be hungry.
In the breeding season of Gond tribal fish in central India fishing is stopped in some parts of Ketan river .
On the Nilgiri hills in southern India, a small hunting community in the remotest part was broken and traditionally their habitations are made of locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community is very peaceful and united, but if someone harms their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters belonged to the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against the British Government to protect our wild land.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who have done something unparalleled for the society.
This kind of work seems to be weak but in reality it has a very deep impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Gurbachan Singh of Punjab.
Gurbachan Singh ji was the son of a common and hardworking farmer.
Before marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we will marry the bride's mother Vadla in a simple way.
There is no need to spend much on these things.
We have to celebrate this occasion in a simple manner.
But he suddenly said, but I have one thing.
Nowadays, when the issue of marriage comes to light then it feels that there will be a big demand in front of the bride and the bride's family that will be difficult for them.
But you will be surprised to know that it was a simple farmer who was the brother Gurbachan Singh and what he had said was the true power of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji said that we will never burn the stubble in our fields.
You can imagine how big a social force is there in it.
And we have seen that there are so many families in our society that transform the individual context into social interests.
The family of Shri Gurbachan Singh ji has given us such an example.
I have read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near the navel.
Kallar Majra is talking about the fact that instead of burning the cereals, they mix it with orange and the technologies that should be used for it are used.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh ji
Congratulations to all those who have been doing their best to keep the environment clean.
You are carrying forward the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle like a true heritage.
The way the sea becomes a sea, small activism and awareness and positive work play a very big role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it has been stated in our texts: : Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace and Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Vishvadeva: Peacefulness: Peacefulness: Vishvadeva: Peace: Peace: Peacefulness: Peace and peace. . Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace.
Peace be upon you, upon you, upon every part of the world, upon every part of the world.
Peace: Peace: Peace: Whenever there is a discussion on world peace, Indias name and contribution will be reflected in the golden letter.
For India, this year's 11th November has a special significance because the first major war ended on 11th November, 100 years ago.
The event marks the completion of 100 years, which will mark the completion of one century of the massive destruction and human destruction that took place in that period.
The first major battle for India was an important event.
In fact, we didn't have to give anything directly to that war.
Yet our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers demonstrated to the world that when there was a war, it was not less than anyone.
Our soldiers have showered valour in remote areas and in adverse situations.
The only purpose for all was to re-establish peace.
In the First World War, the world witnessed the monarchy of all.
According to estimates, nearly one crore soldiers and the same number of people lost their lives.
This has given the entire world the significance of peace.
The interpretation of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony are not merely a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, we need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the story of our North-Eastern India is different.
The natural beauty of the North-East is unique and the people here are very talented.
Our Northeast is known for its best work.
North-East is such a region that has made a lot of progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award for 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
The award is given on behalf of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
You will be glad to know that the award for making the best policy is in line with Oscars.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award in the backdrop of the 51 nominee policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is over.
There is a huge change in the weather.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens.
I urge you to take care of yourself, take care of your health and take care of social interest during these festivals.
This festival is an opportunity to take a new decision.
This festival should move forward in a mission mode with determination and it should be an opportunity for us to make a solemn pledge.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The more you progress the country will progress.
