Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
On the pious festival of Deepawali, greetings to all of you.
The shlok says: It is Light that ushers in joy, health and prosperity into our lives, dispelling negative thought, bringing in positivity.
Friends, festival tourism has its own exciting attractions.
Our India, the country of festivals, possesses limitless possibilities in the realm of festival tourism.
Hence, the Indian Diaspora has a significant role to play in promoting festival tourism in India .
My dear countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different this Diwali.
And within no time, there followed a slew of innumerable inspirational stories on social media.
Today, all five brothers are doing well in their respective professions.
She is the Lakshmi of India in every sense of the term.
Ramesh ji , respectful greetings to your mother.
For Kavita Tiwari, her daughter is the Lakshmi of India, her strength.
She is proud of her daughters excellent painting ability.
She has also secured a good rank in the CLAT exam.
Whereas Megha Jain has mentioned that a 92 year old woman has been offering free drinking water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Megha Ji is truly inspired by the humility and compassion of this Lakshmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
Do read them, get inspired and share similar instances.
I respectfully salute all the Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well known 17th century poetess Sanchi Honnamma has penned a poem in Kannada that embodies the same thought, the same words pertaining to every Lakshmi of India that we referred to.
One feels the foundation of the idea was laid in the 17th century itself.
You will notice the beauty of word, sentiment and thought in this poem in Kannada: (Penninda permegondanu himavantanu.
their prodigious virtuosity cradles our social fabric, ensuring its bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th of November, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakashotsav of Guru Nanak dev ji will be celebrated across the world.
The luminescence of Guru Nanak Dev jis influence can be felt not only in India but around the world.
Many of our Sikh brothers and sisters settled in other countries committedly follow Guru Nanak dev jis ideals.
I can never forget my visits to Gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is much about Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but it will require many an episode of Mann ki Baat.
He accorded the highest significance to the spirit of service.
Guru Nank Dev ji firmly believed that any service done selflessly was beyond evaluation.
He stood firm against social ills such as untouchability.
Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji radiated his message to all corners of the world.
He was the widest travelled of those times.
And wherever he went he won hearts through his straightforwardness, humility and simplicity.
Carrying the message of harmony and equality, he travelled north, south, east and west, meeting people, saints and sages.
It is said that the revered Assamese saint Shankar Dev too was inspired by him.
He also travelled to the holy land of Haridwar.
There is a holy place in Kashi named Gurubagh Gurudwara.
It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev Ji had halted there.
He also went to Buddhist holy sites such as Rajgir and Gaya.
His journeys to the south took him to Sri Lanka, as well.
During his Yatra to Bidar, Karnataka, he devised a solution for water woes the place was grappling with.
During one Udaasi, Gurunanak Dev Ji travelled north to Kashmir and neighboring areas.
He is revered in Uzbekistan too, which he had visited.
During one Udaasi, he widely travelled to Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He secured a revered place in the hearts of millions who followed his messages with complete devotion, a practice that continues even in the present times.
Just a few days ago, Ambassadors of approximately eighty-five countries went to Amritsar from Delhi.
There in the Golden Temple itself, they undertook a holy Darshan, commemorating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Besides Darshan, all these Ambassadors had the opportunity to know more about Sikh traditions and culture.
It's my devout wish to imbibe Guru Nanak Dev Ji's thoughts and ideals into our lives
may we be all the more inspired to make it happen.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure all of you remember the significance of the 31st of October.
When we read and hear about Sardar Saheb's style of working, we come to know of the sheer magnitude of the meticulousness in his planning.
In 1921, in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad, thousands of delegates from across the country were slated to participate.
Sardar Patel was entrusted with overlooking all the arrangements.
He utilized this opportunity in improving the citys water supply network.
He ensured that not a single person would face a problem on account of water.
Not just that, he was also concerned about the safety and security of the delegates shoes and baggage. To ensure that, what he did will surprise you.
He contacted farmers and urged them to craft khadi bags.
On the other hand, it led to a major rise in the sale of khadi.
Our country will always be indebted to Sardar Patel for his steller role in the Constituent Assembly.
He strove to ensure enshrinement of fundamental rights that obliterated any possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, all of us know that as Indias first home minister, Sardar Patel undertook the colossal, historic task of integrating Princely states.
Lakshadweep is one of the most beautiful landscapes in India.
Soon after Partition in 1947, our neighbour had cast an eye on Lakshadweep
a ship bearing their flag was sent there.
When Sardar Patel was informed of this, he wasted no time in initiating stern action.
He urged the Mudaliar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxman Swamy Mudaliar to immediately undertake a mission with people of Travancore to Lakshadweep and take the lead in unfurling the Tricolour there.
Following his orders, the Tricolour was promptly unfurled there and the nefarious dreams of the neighbour of annexing Lakshadweep were decimated within no time.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure all assistance for development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly in Indias progress.
It is an attractive tourist destination too.
I hope you get the opportunity to visit the picturesque islands and its pristine beaches.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October, 2018, is the day when the 'Statue of Unity',in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
It is the tallest statue in the world.
It is double in height compared to the 'Statue of Liberty' located in the US.
The distinction of having the world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride
This means that an average of eight and a half thousand people witnessed the grandeur of the 'Statue of Unity' every day.
Besides, at present,it houses many centres of attraction such as Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, and Childrens Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery, which are all constantly evolving and providing a fillip to the local economy.
Local people are not only getting innovative opportunities of employment but for the convenience of visiting tourists, many villagers are providing facilities like home stays.
We are all witness to the fact that how within a year a place developed as a world famous tourism destination.
People arrive there from the country and abroad.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, which Indian will not be imbued with pride for the fact that recently, Time magazine has included the Statue of Unityin its list of 100 important tourist destinations around the world.
Of course I hope, that all of you will devote some of your precious time to visit the Statue of Unity.
But my appeal is, that every Indian who takes out time to travel must visit at least 15 Tourist Destinations of India with family and experience a night stay at whichever place you go to
Friends, as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated as 'National Unity Day'.
This day imparts the message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
On 31st October, this year too Run for Unity is being organized in consonance with previous years.
The last five years have witnessed - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, union territories, state capitals, district centres, even in small cities belonging to tier two or tier three categories, innumerable men, women, be they the city folk, village folk, children, the youth, the elderly, divyang, all are participating inRun for Unityin large numbers.
Anyway, at present, people have adopted and found a passion for the marathon.
Run for Unity is also one such unique provision.
Running is beneficial for the mind, body and soul.
And so, not just our body, but our mind and value system get integrated with ushering unity in India to take India to loftier heights
And so, in whichever city you reside, you can find out about the Run for Unity schedule.
I hope you will all run on October 31st not only for the unity of India, but also for your physical fitness
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison.
This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a country like ours filled with diversities, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths, at every bend, and at every pit-stop.
My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples of individuals who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony.
Various interest groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way
The kind of language that was spoken in order to generate tension in the atmosphere
There was also an attempt to instill shrillness in the tone of different speakers.
Some of the loudmouths and the braggarts had the sole intention of hogging the spotlight at that time.
And we all know what kind of irresponsible talk was floating around
But this scenario had continued for five days, or seven days, or ten days, but, the delivery of the courts decision generated a pleasant and surprising change of mood in the country.
On the one hand, the machinations went on to generate tension for week or two, but, when the decision was taken on Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects and saints gave restrained and balanced statements.
There were attempts to reduce the tension in the sociopolitical environment.
But I remember that day vividly.
And whenever I do that, I get happy that the dignity of the judiciary was very proudly honoured and no allowance for any heated discourse or tension was made anywhere.
These incidents should always be remembered as they impart us a lot of strength.
That day, that moment, instills in us all a sense of duty.
It is an example of how the voice of unison can bestow strength upon our country.
It was a traumatic moment for our country.
Today, I pay homage to her too.
My dear countrymen, today, if one story that rings from home to home, and rings far and wide,is heard from north to south, east to west and from every corner of India, then that IS the story of cleanliness and sanitation.
Every person, every family, every village wants to narrate their pleasant experiences in relation to the cleanliness mission, because behind this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 125 crore Indians.
The outcome also belongs to 125 crore Indians.
But therein lies a pleasant and interesting experience too.
In such a situation, the segregation and management of garbage is a very important task in itself.
In this scenario, to remove 130 tons and more of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding areas fragile eco-system is a great service
It is an eco-system which is home to rare species like the snow leopard and rare animals like ibex and brown bears.
We all know that Siachen as a glacier is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those who live in low-lying areas and also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are occasions that awaken a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially during Diwali, it is customary in every family to buy something new, get something from the market in smaller or larger quantity.
I had once said that we should try to buy local products.
There is no need to go to the tehsil if our need is met in our village.
I once again wish you all the very best on this auspicious festival of Diwali.
In Diwali we burst fire crackers of all kinds
But, sometimes fire is caused due to carelessness.
I extend many felicitations to you.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There must be hardly any Indian who doesnt feel proud of our Armed Forces, our army jawans, our soldiers.
Every Indian, irrespective of region, caste, religion, sect or language, is ever eager to express joy and show solidarity with our soldiers.
Yesterday, one hundred and twenty-five crore Indians celebrated the Paraakram Parva, the festival of Valour.
We remembered that surgical strike carried out in 2016, where our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the audacity of a proxy war under the garb of terrorism.
how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect us citizens.
A day such as Paraakaram Prava reminds our youth of the glorious heritage of our Army.
It also inspires us to maintain the unity integrity of the country.
I too participated in a programme held at Jodhpur in the land of the valiant, Rajasthan.
In the two world-wars fought in the 20th century, over a lakh of our soldiers made the Supreme Sacrifice
This too was an act of valour on part of our soldiers on the path to peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to various United Nations Peace Keeping Forces in terms of sending forces personnel.
For decades, our brave soldiers wearing blue helmets have played a stellar role in ensuring maintenance of World Peace.
My dear countrymen, the sky offers the rarest of hues.
We celebrate Air Force Day on the 8th of October.
Making a humble beginning in 1932 with six pilots and 19 Airmen, our Air Force has emerged as one of mightiest and the bravest Air Force of the 21st century today.
The Air Force also retaliated befittingly in 1965 too.
Who does not know about the Bangladesh Freedom Struggle of 1971
The Air Force played a very significant role in 1999 by pushing back the intruders and liberating Kargil from their clutches.
The Air Force defeated the enemy at Tiger Hill by carrying out air sorties on their positions round the clock.
Be it the relief and rescue work or disaster management, our country is indebted to our Air Force for the commendable efforts of our Air Warrior.
They have always displayed a unique spirit in times of natural calamities like storms, cyclones, floods and forest fires to extend full assistance to our countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality and has opened its doors for our daughters of India.
Now, the Air Force is offering the option of Permanent Commission to Women besides the Short Service Commission, which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the Red Fort.
Indian can proudly claim that in the armed forces, our Army not only man-power but woman-power too is contributing equally.
Women are already empowered and now getting armed too.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, Officer Abhilash Tomy of our Navy was struggling between life and death.
The whole country was concerned about saving Tomy.
You know, Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous, brave soldier.
He was the first Indian who set on a global voyage in a small boat without any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, he was moving ahead in South Indian Ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race maintaining his speed but suddenly a severe cyclonic storm landed him in trouble.
Yet, this brave heart from the Navy kept struggling for many days in mid-ocean.
A rare example of courage, determination, strength and bravery a few days ago I talked to Abhilash over the telephone after he was rescued and brought safely ground.
My dear countrymen, every child in our country knows the importance of the 2nd of October for our nation.
The 2nd of October, this year, has a special significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to organise various programmes throughout the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhis philosophy has inspired the whole world.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started penning down a few thoughts in the shape of a constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the Freedom Struggle gained momentum, he prepared an amended copy of those ideas.
Revered Bapu, put forth his ideas on various subjects like Farmers, villages, securing of labour rights, cleanliness and promoting of education.
This is also known as the Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced this as a most unique part of his personality.
He made everyone feel that he or she was very important and absolutely necessary for the country.
Then, you will see that your doubt is waning away and your ego is also getting quelled.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhijis mantras is very relevant event today.
The swelling middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, increasing purchasing power
can we remember revered Bapu for a moment while going out for shopping Can we remember that mantra of Bapu
Can we spare a thought while purchasing anything as to who in my country will be benefitted by this purchase
Whose face will sport a smile
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I firmly believe that a small step of yours can surely bring about a very big benefit in the life of the poorest and the most underprivileged person.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that by maintaining cleanliness, freedom will be won then he probably was not aware how this would happen.
But this did happen and India got freedom.
For example, think of purchasing Khadi and handloom products on special occasions this will benefit many weavers.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes have been woven after putting in a hard labour, every thread of these clothes must be utilized.
Lal Bahadur Shastriji had a unique quality in that, he was very humble outwardly but he was rock solid from inside.
His slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is the hall mark of his grand personality.
It was the result of his selfless service to the nation that in a brief tenure of about one and a half years he gave to our jawans and farmers the mantra to reach the pinnacle of success.
My dear countrymen, while remembering revered Bapu today, it is quite natural not to skip talking of cleanliness.
A movement Swachhta Hi Sewa was launched on the 15th of September.
Crores of people got connected with this movement and luckily I also got a chance to participate in the voluntary cleanliness shramdaan with the children of Delhis Ambedkar School.
I went to the school, the foundation of which had been laid by none other than respected Baba Saheb himself.
On the 15th of September, people from all sections across the country connected themselves to this voluntary cleaning movement.
Come on, let us listen to a phone call.
I specially thank you for your phone call.
Sanitation Ministers from countries across the world and experts on the subject of sanitation will converge and share their experiments and experiences.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude on 2nd October, 2018 with the commencement of Bapus 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations.
This is specially essential for the freedom and peace of the exploited, victimised and deprived people and to ensure justice for them.
In the Constitution drafted by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, many provisions were inserted to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the 'National Human Rights Commission' (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 1993.
A few days later NHRC would complete 25 years of its existence.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also promoted respect for human dignity over the years.
Our most beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, had clearly said that human rights are not analien concept for us.
In the emblem of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal mantra harking back to Vedic period- "Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah" is inscribed.
NHRC has instilled widespread awareness of human rights and has played an important role in preventing their misuse.
In its journey of 25 years, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence in the countrymen.
For a healthy society, and for lofty democratic values I feel that, it is a very hope inspiring event.
Today, with NHRC operating at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and inculcate them into practice - this is the very basis of Sab ka SaathSab ka Vikas'.
My dear countrymen, the month of October heralds, Jai Prakash Narayan ji's birth anniversary, the beginning of the birth centenary of Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindiaji.
31 October happens to be the birth anniversary of Sardar sahib, I shall dwell upon his birth anniversary in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I want to mention that for the past few years, the occasion of Sardar Sahibs birth anniversary on October 31 is marked in every small town and district by organizing the 'Run for Unity' race.
Even this year, we should try to organize 'Run for Unity' in our village, town, city or metropolis.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb, because he worked for the unity of our nation throughout his lifetime.
I urge you all that on October 31, through 'Run for Unity', to strengthen our efforts and bind every section of the society as a unified unit.
This will be a great tribute to Sardar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, be it Navratri, Durgapuja or Vijayadashmi, I offer all my heartfelt greetings to all of you on account of these holy festivals.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Rakshabandhan.
Heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the bond of love trust between a brother a sister.
For centuries, this festival has proved to be a shining example of social harmony.
The whole atmosphere will reverberate to the sonorous chants calls of Hathi, Ghoda, Palki, Jai Kanhaiya Lal ki and Govinda-Govinda.
Bhagini Chinmayee, Sister Chinmayee has asked a question in Sanskrit.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Poornima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those actively involved in preserving conserving this glorious heritage, helping it to reach out to the masses.
Every language has its own significance, sanctity.
India takes great pride in the fact that Tamil is the most ancient of world languages.
Science technology, agriculture health, Mathematics Management, economy environment, the entire spectrum has been touched upon.
You will be pleased to know that even today, residents of village Mattur in Shivamoga district of Karnataka use Sanskrit as their lingua franca.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teacher Day across the country.
I felicitate all the teachers in the country on this occasion.
I also salute your sense of commitment towards science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the monsoon comes along, bringing a new ray of hope to our toiling farmers.
It provided much needed succor to the scorched trees shrubs, and to parched water bodies
on the other hand excessive rainfall causes devastating floods.
Its a vagary of Nature that some places have received higher rainfall compared to other places.
Disasters, unfortunately leave behind a trail of destruction.
But one gets to witness facets of humanity, humaneness during disasters.
We know that jawans of our armed forces are the vanguards of rescue relief operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned as saviors of those trapped in the floods.
The Air Force, Navy, Army, BSF, CISF, RAF, every agency has played an exemplary role in the rescue relief operations.
I would like to specially mention the arduous endeavors of the NDRF daredevils.
The capability, commitment controlling situation through rapid decisions of the NDRF have made them a cynosure of every Indians eye, worthy of respect admiration.
Yesterday was the festival of Onam.
We pray for Onam to provide strength to the country, especially Kerala so that it returns to normalcy on a newer journey of development.
Once again on behalf of all Indians, I would like to re assure each everyone in Kerala and other affected places that at this moment of calamity, the entire country stands by them.
My dear countrymen I was looking into the suggestions received for Mann Ki Baat.
The subject about which most of the people from across the country have written is Our revered Atal Behari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar, Bihar and numerous others have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov asking me to speak on various aspects of Ataljis life.
As soon as the people in our country and abroad heard of the demise of Atalji on 16th August, everyone drowned in sadness.
He was a leader who gave up his position as Prime Minister fourteen years ago.
In a way, he was cut-off from active politics for the last 10 years.
People remembered him as the best member of Parliament, sensitive writer, best orator and most popular Prime Minister and will continue to remember him.
The country will ever remain grateful to Atalji for bringing good governance in the main stream.
India will remain ever grateful to Atalji for bringing the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two important changes in Indias politics.
First one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15 of the total seats in the state Assembly.
Atalji changed it.
This effort of his resulted in saving of money as well as of resources.
This also helped in improving efficiency.
It could only be a visionary like Atalji who brought in this transformation and as a result of this, healthy traditions blossomed in our polity.
Atalji was a true patriot.
It was during his tenure that the timing of presenting the budget was changed.
Earlier, as was the British tradition, the Budget used to be presented at 5 pm because in London, Parliament used to start working at that time.
In the year 2001, Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
Similarly, you can see that presently efforts are afoot and discussions are being held about simultaneously holding the elections for Lok Sabha and for state assemblies.
This is a good development and a healthy sign for our democracy.
I must say that developing healthy traditions for a sound democracy, making constant efforts to strengthen democracy, encouraging open-minded debates would also be a appropriate tribute to Atalji.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 percent and that of Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of important bills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during this session.
As you know, a demand to constitute an OBC Commission similar to SCST commission was long pending for decades.
The country fulfilled its resolve this time to make an OBC Commission and also granted it Constitutional powers.
This step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice.
With this point in view Parliament has made a provision of strictest punishment by passing the Criminal Act Amendment Bill.
Those guilty of rape will get a minimum sentence of ten years and those found guilty of raping girls below the age of 12 years will be awarded the death sentence.
Recently, you might have read in newspapers, that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, after a brief hearing of two months, pronounced the death sentence on two criminals found guilty of raping a minor girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days.
Courts in Rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions.
This Act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
When we move ahead in the national interest, a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived ones can also be brought about.
In the Monsoon session, this time, everyone jointly presented an ideal approach.
Today, I publicly express my heartfelt gratitude to all MPs.
My dear countrymen The attention of crores of Indians is focused on the Asian Games being held in Jakarta.
The Asian Games are going on.
I wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country.
When India will be fit, only then Indias future will be bright.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners at the Asian Games and also wish the remaining players perform well.
Many good wishes to you all on the National Sports Day.
He is greatly revered in that part of our country and the whole nation remembers him with great respect and regard.
In his memory, 15th September is observed as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have created their own identity in the world.
It is called Bhoonga in Kutch.
This house has faced three earthquakes.
But, you did not find any damage anywhere.
These houses were built by our ancestors in sync with nature and surroundings of this place.
And she was saying all this with such a feeling of pride that it made me think that engineers in that era had constructed such structures according to the local situations which kept the common man safe and secured.
While observing Engineers Day, we should think of the future as well.
Workshops should be held at different places.
What are the things we need to learn in the changing times
What should be taught to the students
We shall meet.
Of late, News of abundant rainfall has been steadily coming in.
At places, we are hearing of rising concerns on account of excessive showers
at some places, people are anxiously waiting for the rains to begin.
After all it was humankind that chose the path of conflict with Nature and consequently earnt her periodic wrath.
And that is why it becomes our collective responsibility...
Let us be lovers of nature, protectors of Nature, conservers of Nature...
in Thailand a team of 12 teenaged football players and their coach went on an excursion to a cave.
Usually it takes a few hours to enter and exit that cave.
But destiny had different plans that day.
Not able to find a way out, they perched themselves a top a mound inside the cave
not for a day or two, but an entire 18 days.
on the other, the world over, humanity joined hands in expressing the noblest the most righteous of human virtues.
The world over, people prayed for the safe secure exit of these children.
No stone was left unturned to trace their where abouts, their well-being and their rescue.
Their timely evacuation was of a prime concern, since the heavy monsoon would have delayed rescue-attempts by a few months.
Anyway, the good news of their safe exit spread a sigh of relief, a sense of inner calm.
But I feel like viewing the entire sequence of events from another perspective, i.
The sense of responsibility commitment, prevailing at every level was astonishing.
The government, their parents, family members, media, citizens of that country, each one of them displayed an awe-inspiring sense of peace and patience.
During the operation, a sailor from Thailand Navy sacrificed his life.
What is certainly required is focusing on your goal with a calm steady demeanour and the will to strive.
A few days ago, the countrys beloved poet Neeraj Ji left us forever.
Every word of Neeraj jis work can instill a lot of strength inspiration in us Indians.
This is the time which is Peak season for colleges.
July is the month when the youth step into a new phase of life, where the focus shifts from questions and veers towards cut-offs.
The attention of students steers from home to hostel.
Students submit themselves to the tutelage of Professors vis a vis the shadow of their parents.
I firmly believe that my young friends must be enthusiastic happy on the commencement of their college life.
Leaving home for the first time, moving out of ones village, coming out of a protective environment amounts to taking charge of the course of ones life.
This multitude of young people leave their homes for the first time to chart a new direction for their lives.
All I would like to say to you is Be calm, enjoy life, seek inner happiness in life.
Old friends are invaluable.
Childhood friends are precious, but selecting, making maintaining new friendships is a task that requires immense prudence.
Keep learning something new, such as newer skills and languages.
how Asharam Choudhury a student from an extremely poor family in Madhya Pradesh overcame lifes many challenges to achieve success.
In his maiden attempt, he cracked the Entrance exam for MBBS at AIIMS, Jodhpur.
His father earns his daily bread by waste-picking.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I happened to glance through a news item, it said- Two youths make Modis dream come true.
On reading further, I came to know how our youngsters put in efforts to transform the lives of the common man by making smart and creative use of technology.
It so happened that once I was interacting with Indian youth in San Jose town of America hailed as a Technology Hub.
I had appealed to those young people to think over how could they use their talent to Indias benefit and do something in that direction whenever they found time.
With their joint efforts, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have developed a SmartGaonApp by utilizing their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the villagers with the whole world but now they can obtain any information on their own mobile phones.
This App is actually bringing in a Digital Revolution in the village, with the help of this App, it has since become easier to record, track and monitor developmental work being done in the village.
This App contains phone directory, News section, events list, health centre and information centre of the village.
This App is very useful for the farmers and the grammar feature of the App and FACT rate among the farmers functions like a market place for their products.
If you look into this incident minutely, one thing will strike you and that is the young man living in America adhering to that countrys life-style and ideology, who left India many years ago but, knows the finer details about his village, knows about the challenges and still is emotionally attached to his village.
This seems to be the reason as to how he could develop this App which is most suited to needs of the village.
A sense of belonging towards the village and towards ones roots and also a spirit to show and do something is naturally there in each and every Indian.
But, sometimes because of time, sometimes because of distance and at times because of situations that spirit gets faded but just with a touch of a tiny spark, everything re-emerges which takes one back to old memories.
Pandharpur is a holy town in Solapur district in Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi warkari or pilgrims start the Pandharpur Yatra on foot.
This yatra (journey) is known as Wari and lakhs of warkaris join this.
Wooden foot wear or padukas of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are placed in a palki and pilgrims begin their pilgrimage chanting Vitthal-Vitthal.
Pilgrims go to have a darshan of Vitthal who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vitthal safeguards the interests of the poor, the deprived ones and the ones who are suffering.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana have deep devotion and respect for Vitthal.
Visiting Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and its grandeur, beauty and spiritual bliss is a unique experience in itself.
I request the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to visit Pandharpur Wari at least once, whenever they get a chance.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ram Dass, Tukaram are relevant even today in educating the masses.
May they be compositions like Bharud (Hkk:M) or Abhang (vHkax), we get a great message of amity, love and brotherhood.
We get the mantra to enable the society to fight against blind-faith through devotion and bhakti.
He had the courage to show a mirror to the British about their wrong doings.
The British were so afraid of Lok Manya Tilak that they tried to charge him of sedition thrice in two decades
this is no small thing.
I want to narrate an interesting incident to the countrymen which is connected with Lok Manya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When on August 1 1920, Lok Manya Tilakji passed away, Patel ji had decided then itself that he would build his statue in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad municipal corporation and he immediately selected Victoria Garden as a venue for Lok Manya Tilaks memorial and this was the very Victoria Garden which was named after the British ueen.
Finally, the statue got built and Sardar Saheb got it unveiled by none other than Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929
and the most interesting point is that during that inaugural ceremony revered Bapuji said that with the coming of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a man but it has got the strength on the basis of which, building the statue of Tilakji has become possible.
Tradition of publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav was also initiated with the efforts of Lok Manya Tilakji.
The celebration of Ganesh Utsav publicly had become an effective medium in promoting a spirit of social awakening, integration, amity and equality among the masses besides projecting a sense of dedication and festivity in them.
Thus, it becomes clear that our younger generations still care for the brave heroes of our ancient past, its heritage and history.
Today, you can see Ganesh pandals in almost every street of various cities.
All families in that street collectively organize these pandals.
This is an excellent chance for our youth wherein they can learn qualities of leadership and organization and inculcate these in themselves.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and positive results of development.
on July 23, another son of Mother India was born, who sacrificed his life so that his countrymen could breathe freely in an atomsphere of freedom.
I am talking about none other than Chandrasekhar Azad.
Where will you find a young man in India who will not be inspired listening to these lines -Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mein hai Dekhna hai zor kitna baazu-e-qaatil mein hai(The desire for martyrdom is now in our heartsLet us see the strength in the arms of my executioner) These lines inspired many young people like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and many others.
Azads courage and passion for freedom inspired the youth of the day.
Chandrashekhar Azad put his life on the stake, but he never bowed in front of the foreign rule.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, India's brave daughter and a farmer daughter Hima Das made history by winning the gold medal in the 400-meter race event.
Ekta Bhyan, another daughter of the country, in response to my letter, has emailed me from Indonesia, where she is now preparing for the Asian Games.
You have brought glory to the Nation.
Ekta has won the gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 held in Tunisia.
Her achievement is all the more special because she has made the imposing challenges in her life the key to her success.
Daughter Ekta Bhyan in 2003, lost the use of half of her lower body due to road accident, but this daughter did not lose courage and made herself all the more stronger to perform this grand feat.
I salute Ekta Bhyanji, Yogesh athuniaji and Sundar Singh Ji, all of you for your fortitude and passion, and congratulate you
My dear countrymen, the month of August is significant because it is filled with historically important dates and festivals, but due to the weather sometimes sickness also enters the house.
I wish all of you best wishes for good health, for this month of August imbued with the spirit of patriotism and for many festivals that have continued over centuries.
We will meet once again for Mann Ki Baat' next time.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru.
Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistans first international match and its a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India.
I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghanis words on Twitter tagging me along The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan.
Im also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan.
He is an asset to the world of cricket.
The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs.
This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents skills of our youth.
I felicitate both the teams of India Afghanistan.
I sincerely hope, that in future too, well play with each other with the best sportsman spirit shine together.
My dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights.
On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison.
Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people.
ealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival.
If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over
It is a matter of great pride for a hundred twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea sky.
A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same.
Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth.
Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues.
Heartwarming was an instance in Ahmedabad.
Around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record.
Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries.
Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets
yoga has proved them in a concrete manner.
We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life.
The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments.
Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health.
Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills.
Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems.
Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctors Day on the 1st of July.
My dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India.
Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other.
Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage.
It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th.
I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir.
Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar
In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in ones pathway to heaven.
On the contrary, breathing ones last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven.
Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view.
He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times.
That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there.
Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses Saakhis and Dohas stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood.
These were his ideals.
We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions.
They are relevant inspiring even in modern times.
I quote a doha , , The true saint is the one who recognizes understands the sufferings of others. Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate.
Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion.
He was a thinker way ahead of his times.
And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries.
Guru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour.
The history of India's struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices.
There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab.
In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity.
Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty
This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision.
Mukherjee on indigenization of India's defence production, in the establishment of four most successful mega projects- Chittaranjan locomotive works factory, Hindustan aircraft factory, Sindri fertilizer factory and Damodar Valley Corporation and other river valley projects, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee contributed significantly.
People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements.
Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages.
At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur
And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people.
Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their schools tinkering lab.
I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasnt a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me.
In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government's credit.
An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength.
I again want to express my gratitude to you all.
We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness.
In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination.
On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture.
The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust.
Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.
A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest.
I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.
'One Nation, One Tax' was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today.
If Ive to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of One Nation One Tax reform, then I credit the states of our nation.
GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country.
states which have different priorities, but in spite of all this, all the decisions that have been taken in the GST Council so far have been taken with absolute consensus.
Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.
Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology.
However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement.
My dear countrymen Once again, while concluding this episode, I wait most eagerly for the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat, of meeting you and talking to you.
I wish you many felicitations.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I once again have been blessed with the opportunity to be face-to-face with you.
I am sure you distinctly remember that for the last many months, a naval team comprising six women Commanders was on a voyage.
I want to tell you something about the Naavika Saagar Parikrama.
They traversed a multitude of oceans, many a sea, over a distance of almost twenty two thousand nautical miles.
This was a first of its kind event in the entire world.
Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
On the 16th of May, a team comprising five tribal students of an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra- Maneesha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madhavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam- scaled the worlds highest peak.
These young boys girls had been selected under Mission Shaurya. True to its name, they brought glory to the country with their brave deed of conquering the Everest.
I congratulate these young friends and members of the school in Chandrapur, from the core of my heart.
Just a while ago, 16 year old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to scale Everest from the Nepal side.
Heartiest congratulations, Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first ever father-daughter duo to ascend Everest.
And its not that only the young are climbing Everest.
This deed is commendable indeed
it also displays their commitment towards cleanliness and the environment.
People have been ascending the Everest for years many have managed to reach the peak successfully.
I congratulate these daredevils, especially the daughters from the core of my heart.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, just a couple of months ago, when I mentioned Fit India, I did not think it would draw such a good response
that a large number of people would come forward to support it.
When I say Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more we will inspire the country to come out play.
People are sharing videos of Fitness Challenge on social media
they are tagging each other to spread the challenge.
Everybody is now getting connected with this Fit India Campaign.
People from the film fraternity, from the world of Sports, common citizens of the country, members of the armed forces, school teachers or even those toiling in fields and farms, their rising notes are building up a crescendo Hum Fit toh India Fit... If we are fit, India is fit.
My dear countrymen, many a time in Mann Ki Baat, you must have heard me mention a thing or two about sports sportspersons.
And in the last episode, our heroes of the Commonwealth Games shared with us their Mann Ki Baat, matters close to their hearts through this programme.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that sports games that were once a part parcel of every childs life, in every lane in the neighbourhood, are fading into oblivion.
These games used to be a special feature of summer holidays.
Sometimes in scorching afternoons at times after dinner, children used to play with exuberant abandon for hours together, leaving all worries behind.
Some games saw the participation of the whole family.
The unity, intrinsic to our countrys diversity can be witnessed in these games.
A single game is known by distinct names at different places.
I am from Gujarat. I known of a game played in Gujarat called Chomal Isto.
It is played with cowries or tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board.
It used to be played in almost every state.
Known as Chowkabara in Karnataka, Attoo in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakaali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Daayaam and Thaayaam in Tamilnadu, Changaa Po in Rajasthan, it had innumerable names.
In Andhra Pradesh it is called Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Odisha its called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra, Vittidaaloo.
Some games are seasonal.
There is a season for flying kites.
they teach us values in life, such as, setting targets, building up determination, developing team spirit and fostering mutual co-operation.
From tiny tots to Grandfather-Grandmother, when we all play these games together then the term Generation Gap disappears on its own.
At the same time, we also come to know about our culture and traditions.
Many games also make us aware about our society, environment and other spheres.
It is crucial that today schools, neighbourhoods and youth congregations should come forward and promote these games.
Through crowd sourcing we can create a very large archive of our traditional games.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, our nation, India will officially host the World Environment Day Celebrations.
I appeal to all of you, that while trying to understand the importance of this theme, we should all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our environment, on our wild life and our health.
Let us all visit the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and try to imbibe and inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday life.
Being sensitive towards nature, protecting nature, should come naturally to us
these virtues should be embedded in our sanskar.
In the past few weeks, we all witnessed that there were dust storms in the different regions of the country, along with heavy winds and unseasonal heavy rains.
These calamities are basically the result of the change in weather patterns.
Our culture, our traditions have never taught us to be at loggerheads with nature.
We have to live in harmony and in synchronicity with nature, we have to stay in touch with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this wisdom at every step of his life.
Today when India speaks of climate justice or plays a major role in the Cop21 and Paris agreements or when we unite the whole world through the medium of International Solar Alliance, they all are rooted in fulfilling that very dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this environment day, let all of us give it a good thought as to what can we do to make our planet cleaner and greener
How can we progress in this direction
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, you do remember the 21st of June now
not only you and I, June 21st remains a part of the entire worlds collective consciousness.
The practice of yoga leads to building up of courage, which always protects us like a father.
When so many attributes become one's partner, then that yogi conquers all forms of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the citizens to adopt their legacy of yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
This was the very month, the month of May 1857, when Indians had displayed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers demonstrated their bravery whilst standing up against the injustice.
It is indeed sad that we kept on calling the events of 1857 only as a rebellion or a soldiers mutiny for a very long time.
In fact, May 1857 was not only evaluated as a minor historical incident but was also an attempt to dent our self-respect.
It was Veer Savarkar who boldly expostulated by writing that whatever happened in 1857 was not a revolt but was indeed the First War of Independence.
Savarkar jis personality was full of special qualities
he was a worshipper of both weapons or shashtra and Knowledge or shaashtras.
Generally Veer Savarkar is renowned for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj.
But besides these sterling qualities, he was also a striking poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill and unity.
A wonderful account about Savarkarji has been given by our dear honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
What an accurate depiction of Savarkar by Atal ji
Savarkar marched along with both poetry and revolution.
Our daughters, who were forced to sift through garbage and beg from home to home in order to earn a living - today they are learning sewing and stitching clothes to cover the impoverished.
I wish all these daughters, brimming with hope and trust, a very bright future.
They have demonstrated that if you have the desire to do something and if you are determined towards that goal then success can be achieved despite all odds
And this is not only about Sikar, but in every corner of India, you will witness something akin to this.
If you observe in your neighbourhood, then you will witness for yourselves how people overcome the difficulties in their lives
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, and enjoy tea there, a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues.
today you will be surprised to know that the lives of more than 70 children are being illuminated through education due to his efforts.
He has opened a school named 'Asha Ashvaasan', spending 50 of his income for children living in slums and hutments.
He ensures education, health and meals for all the children coming to this school.
Who amongst us does not know the Vedic shloka 'Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya'
However, it has been put into practice by D.
Your surroundings too must be full of such inspiring happenings.
There must be innumerable incidents.
Come, let us take positivity forward.
People will wait for the moon in a few days from now onwards.
Witnessing the moon means that the festival of Eid can be celebrated.
After an entire month of fasting during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a harbinger of celebrations.
I hope and believe that everyone will celebrate Eid with gaiety and fervor and on this occasion children will specially get a grand Eidi.
We shall meet once again in another episode of Mann Ki Baat next month.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Just a while ago, from the 4th of April to the 15th of April, the 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia.
71 countries, including India, participated therein.
With an event of such scale magnitude, which saw the participation of thousands of sportspersons from myriad corners of the world, can you imagine the mood that must have pervaded the atmosphere there
An air of excitement, zeal, enthusiasm, hope, aspirations, the determination to achieve who would want to stay away from an atmosphere like that
Shooting or Wrestling, Table Tennis or Badminton, it was a record performance for India.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze, India bagged a tally of around 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian swell with pride.
Of course, winning medals is a moment of joy glory for a sportsperson
it is equally so as a festival of laurels for the country her countrymen.
After the conclusion of a match, representing India, when the athletes draped in the tricolor rise, displaying their medals, the notes of the National Anthem being played evoke a sense of joy and fulfillment, glory and honour.
Perhaps, to express those sentiments Ill run short of words.
But I want to share with you what I heard from these heroes.
I feel immensely proud
Special in the sense that this time there were many pathbreaking firsts.
Are you aware that out of the wrestlers who represented India, each one of them returned with a medal
Manika Batra won a medal in each of the events that she competed in.
She is the first Indian woman to win a gold in the individual table tennis category too.
India clinched the maximum number of medals in shooting.
Sachin Chowdhary is the sole Indian Para Power Lifter to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games.
This edition of the games was special on one more count- a majority of the medalists was women athletes.
In squash, boxing, weightlifting and shooting the performance of women turned out to be par excellence.
The final contest in Badminton took place between two Indian Shuttlers, Saina Nehwal and P.
The whole country watched it with abated breath.
Athletes who participated in these games hail from various parts of the country, even from smaller towns.
Today, the positions they have secured for themselves, the targets they have achieved, owes a lot to the efforts contribution of their parents, guardians, coaches, support staff, schools, teachers, the atmosphere provided by their Schools, during this journey in their lives.
Even their friends have contributed by boosting their morale under all circumstances.
I was overjoyed to see people getting connected to it with a lot of enthusiasm.
Expressing support for this, many people have written to me, sent me letters, shared fitness mantra- Fit India stories on social media.
A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsale, sharing his photo by the swimming pool, has written, My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Rooma Devnath writes, I truly feel happy healthy through my Morning Walks.
She further adds, For me, fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
Devnathji, indeed, happiness is fitness, and theres no doubt about it.
Dhawal Prajapati, sharing a photograph of himself trekking, has written For me, travelling trekking is Fit India.
It was heartening to see many eminent personalities encouraging our youth in interesting ways for Fit India.
Cine artiste Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
He has mentioned that this exercise benefits muscles of the back and the stomach, to a great extent.
in this hes trying his hand on the volleyball with others.
Many other young people have shared their experiences, having joined the Fit India efforts.
I feel movements like these are beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
I would additionally like to mention, that the movement of Fit India, without any expense, is called YOG.
Yog has a special significance in the Fit India campaign.
You too must be busy with preparations...
the significance, the merit of 21st June, International Yog Day has been accepted welcomed globally.
Do begin preparing for the Day rightaway.
And not just yourself- your city, village, neighbourhood, school, college, men, women, everyone should make an attempt to connect with yog.
You must have viewed an animated video depicting me, that has been widely circulated.
I congratulate those from the field of animation for highlighting nuances, just the way a teacher does.
You too will benefit from it.
Ive seen a lot of young people these days, spending time in learning new things.
as it is, an altogether new experience in itself.
One gets an opportunity to experience life anew, away from closeted walls, away from paper pen and computers.
Dear young friends, today I urge you to undergo a special internship.
Three Ministries of the Government of India maybe four- Sports, HRD, Department of Drinking water have come together to launch a Swachch Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Even the cause of the cleanliness campaign will get a boost, and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, well surely attain a sense of fulfillment.
Once again, I invite students young people, boys girls to avail of the benefits of the internship.
You can register yourselves for the Swachch Bharat Summer Internship on Mygov.
I hope our youth will lend a hand in taking this movement of cleanliness forward.
Do send in your learning experience, do post your stories, photos and videos.
Come.
Let us turn this vacation into a learning opportunity, for a totally new experience.
I try to watch Good News India programme on Doordarshan whenever I get a chance and I would appeal to my countrymen that we all should also watch this Good News India programme wherein we get to know as to how many people in various parts of our country are doing many good things and that such good things are happening.
This group of youngsters has started a big campaign in Delhi for providing education to the street children and slum dwellers.
Initially, shocked to see the condition of children begging around or doing some menial jobs that this group of youngsters got dedicatedly, selflessly involved into this creative mission.
Starting with just 15 children from the slums near Geeta Colony in New Delhi it is now being run at 12 places and two thousand children have been brought under its fold.
Young teachers associated with this campaign find out a free time of two hours from their busy schedule and contribute in this stupendous mission of bringing out a social transformation.
Dear brothers and sisters, in this very way, some farmers from hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
With their collective efforts, they have not only changed their own fortunes but have changed fortunes of the whole region.
In Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, main crops sown are Mandwa, Chaulai, Corn or Barley.
This being a hilly area, the farmers did not get a fair price of their produce.
But, the farmers in Kapkot tehsil decided to come out of this situation and adopted a value- addition process and changed the loss incurring equation into a profit-earning one.
Besides, there is a strong belief that the land in this area is iron-rich and these iron rich biscuits are very good for pregnant women as they overcome the deficiency of iron.
These farmers have formed a cooperative society in Munar village and set-up a biscuit factory there.
Impressed by the bold initiative of these farmers, the administration has also linked this to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being supplied upto Almora and Kousani besides being sold to about fifty Aanganwadi kendras in Bagheshwar district.
My dear countrymen, we often hear that in, times to come, the world will face a war because of water.
Everyone talks about this but do we not have any responsibility towards conservation of water
Do we not feel that water conservation must be a social responsibility
How can we conserve each single drop of rain water
And, we all know this. And, water conservation is not a new topic for us
it is neither a part of the academic curriculum nor a part of our languages.
Our forefathers have lived this as a way of life for centuries together.
They gave due priority and importance to each single drop of water.
They found out newer methods in order to conserve every single drop of water.
Those of you who might be getting a chance to visit Tamilnadu might have noticed that in some temples in the state, there are carvings on stone depicting irrigation system, water conservation methods and drought management.
May it be Mannarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai you will get to see massive stone inscriptions to this effect.
Several baodis (stepwells) are famous as tourist spots but please do not forget that these are the living symbols of the water conservation campaigns which our forefathers had accomplished.
Adalaj and Patan Ki Raniki Vaav (Baodi) in Gujarat is a UNESCO World Heritage site and its grandeur is to be seen to be believed.
Baodis are water temples in a way.
If you happen to go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chand Baodi.
Budget under MNREGA is also utilized for this water conservation activity.
During the last three years, everyone in his or her own way has contributed towards water conservation and water management.
An average of 32,000 crore rupees have been spent besides the MNREGA budget each year on water conservation and water management.
If we talk of 2017-18, 55 percent of the total outlay of Rupees 64 thousand crores, which comes to around rupees 35 thousand crores, has been spent on works like water conservation.
In last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land got more benefit through water conservation and water management measures.
Some people have really benefitted very well from MNREGA budget provisions made by the Government of India for water conservation and water management works.
The Ganges and the Yamuna have plentiful of water but there are many other places in Uttar Pradesh like Fatehpur district where two small rivers namely Sasur-Khaderi got dried out.
After receiving the reports of Remote Sensing Imagery and Inter Department Coordination, the district administration took up the responsibility of soil and water conservation on a massive scale.
They succeeded in reviving the dried out Sasur Khaderi river with the help and cooperation of people from 40-45 villages of the area.
This grand achievement is a big boon for animals, birds, farmers, crops and villages.
Gurudev Tagore was a personality full of knowledge and intellect whose writings left an indelible mark on everyone.
And, whenever I got a chance to listen to poems like Anandloke and Aaguner, Poroshmoni, I used to feel as if my mind was being energised.
You must also have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay my respectful homage to Rabindra Nath Tagore.
The month of Ramazan is celebrated with full reverence and respect throughout the world.
The sociological and collective aspect of fasting is that when a person experiences hunger himself, he comes to realize the hunger of others.
When he is thirsty, he realizes the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings of Prophet Muhammad-peace be upon him- and his message.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood as morals from his life.
People donate generously to the needy during this holy month.
My dear countrymen Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We must be proud of the fact that India is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the very synonym of power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate Lord Buddhas teaching as well as, pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps.
Lord Buddha was the fountainhead of egalitarianism, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values, which are most desired in the world today.
Baba Saheb Dr.
Ambedkar stressed that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion than this.
This form of compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha for the alleviation of suffering of the people.
It forges a link between us and many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar where Buddhist traditions and his preaching are a part of their origins.
I am also very pleased that the Government of India is a partner in the restoration of many Buddhist temples which also includes the centuries old magnificent Anand Temple in Bagan in Myanmar.
I seek benediction from Lord Buddha for the entire world, so that we can fulfill our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, as we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the idols of laughing Buddha, it is said that laughing Buddha brings one good fortune, but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in India's defense history.
That day also was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, at Indias western end a nuclear test was conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
India's test was not only successful but in a way, India had demonstrated its might in the field of science and technology.
We can also say 11 May 1988 is engraved in the history of India as a demonstration of her military power.
Lord Buddha has shown the world- that the power of inner strength or that of the soul is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when you are sturdy as a nation, you can be at peace with others.
The month of May, 1998 is not just important for the country from the aspect that nuclear tests were conducted this very month, but the manner in which they were carried out is also important.
It has revealed to the entire world that India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can reach loftier destinations and earn new laurels.
On that day, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra - "Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan, Jai-Vigyan.
Now that when we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Pokhran test conducted on May 11, 1998, I ask the younger generations of our nation to imbibe the mantra of 'Jai-Vigyan' given by Atalji for enhancing the might and the power of India, to build a modern India, a powerful India and a self-reliant India.
Synergize your energy with the strength of India.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy day of Ram Navami.
My heartiest greetings to countrymen on this pious, festive occasion.
We have seen how closely the power of Ram Naam, the chant of Lord Rams name, permeated every moment of revered Bapus life.
A while ago, when distinguished dignitaries of all ASEAN Countries were here on the 26th of January, they were accompanied by cultural troupes from their respective countries.
And its a matter of immense pride that a majority of these countries presented the Ramayan in front of us.
This signifies that Ram Ramayan continues to inspire and have a positive impact, not just in India, but in that part of the world too.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ramnavami.
My dear countrymen, just like every time earlier, I have received a rather large number of letters, e mails, phone calls and comments from you.
I read a post written on MyGov by Komal Thakkar ji, where she has referred to starting on-line courses for Sanskrit.
Alongwith being IT professional, your love for Sanskrit has gladdened me.
I have instructed the concerned department to convey to you efforts being made in this direction.
I shall also request listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are engaged in the field of Sanskrit, to ponder over ways means to take Komaljis suggestion forward.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji of Village Baraakar, District Nalanda, Bihar I read your comments written on the Narendra Modi App.
Long live the land and that will be conceivable only when we begin feeling concerned about every living being on this land.
You have urged one and all to retain and keep aside some water for birds animals, during summer time.
Sakal ji, I have conveyed your sentiments to our listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji has asked me to speak to the youth concerning their health.
He feels that our youth are physically weak, compared to those of other Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I feel I should speak in detail to all of you on Fit India.
In fact, all you young people can come together to launch a movement of Fit India.
Recently, the President of France paid a visit to Kashi, Varanasi based Shriman Prashant Kumar has written that glimpses of that visit were extremely touching, appealing left a deep impact.
And it is his heart felt desire to see all those photos videos being shared on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India has already done that on social media and the Narendra Modi App, beginning that very day.
You may now like them, re-tweet them, post them to your friends.
This time, maximum number of letters are from children who have written about exams.
They have shared their vacation plans.
Theyve expressed their concern on the availability of water for birds animals.
Our farmer brothers sisters have written on Kisan Melas, Farmer Carnivals and activities revolving around farming, being held across the country.
uite a few active citizens have sent in suggestions on the subject of water conservation.
Ever since we have begun conversing with each other in Mann Ki Baat through the medium of radio, I have noticed a pattern that in the sweltering heat of this season, most letters focus around topic pertaining to summer time.
Just before examinations, letter pour in, touching on the anxieties of our young student friends who are about to appear.
During the festival season, our festivals, our culture, our traditions are focused upon.
And why should not things change
In utterances of yours, in your experiences, in the examples that you quote, there exists immense inspiration, unfathomable energy, unparalleled warmth
In a way, this is endowed with the might to transform the entire season-cycle of the country.
When I heard the story of Kanpur based Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary, of how he visits the underprivileged on footpaths and offers free medicines to them, it gives one an opportunity to feel the sense of brotherhood that prevails in the country.
Thirteen years ago, on account of a delay in medical treatment, a Cab driver from Kolkata, Saidul Laskar lost his sister.
He vowed to construct a hospital in order to ensure that none of the underprivileged face a similar situation due to lack of medical aid.
In this mission of his, Saidul sold off family jewellery and raised funds through charity.
His cab passengers too contributed large-heartedly.
A young engineer girl donated her first salary for this noble cause.
This is the power of New India.
Today the whole world has changed the way it looks at India.
Today, the entire country, the youth, women, the marginalized, the underprivileged, the middle class, in fact every section has awakened to a new confidence ... YES, we can go forward, the country can take great strides.
An atmosphere of positivity built on a self confidence filled with hope has pervaded all over.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very crucial for our farming brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji they all recognized agriculture and the farmer as vital aspects of the nations economy and also for the common mans life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji generally insisted on conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and also highlighted the importance of an improvised agricultural infrastructure.
Chaudhari Charan Singh in his speech in 1979 had urged our farmers to use new technology and to adopt new innovations and underlined their vital significance.
I recently visited the Krishi Unnati Mela organized in New Delhi.
But one thing that impressed me most was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers of the state.
This state has a small area but it has attained a grand success.
Our farmers in Meghalaya, in the year 2015-16, achieved record production as compared to the last five years.
They have showed that if once the targets are set, spirits are high and with a strong resolve, the set targets can most certainly be attained.
Brothers and sisters, in this years budget a big decision has been taken to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce.
It has been decided that the MSP of notified crops will be fixed at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are on to connect local village mandis to wholesale market and then on with the global market.
Twenty- two thousand rural haats in the country will be upgraded by creating the necessary infrastructure and these will be integrated with APMC and e-NAM platform- so that the farmers would not have to go to distant places for selling their produce.
In other words, such a system is being set up where in farms in any part of the country will have a market-connect.
My dear countrymen, this year Mahatma Gandhis 150th birth anniversary celebrations will begin.
How should the country celebrate it
Swachch Bharat is already our resolve
besides this, how can our 125 crore countrymen pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by working in close harmony
I request you all to share your opinions and suggestions with everyone via MyGov.
What should be the logo for Gandhi 150
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and have to take the country to newer heights by drawing inspiration from Bapu.
In the health sector the nation has now moved ahead from the conventional approach.
Earlier, every aspect regarding health used to be a responsibility of the Health Ministry alone.
But now, all departments and ministries- be it the Sanitation Ministry or Ayush Ministry or Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Consumer Affairs Ministry or the Women Child Welfare Ministry or even the State Governments- they are all working together for Swasth Bharat and stress is being laid on affordable health alongside preventive health.
Preventive health care is the least costly and the easiest one as well.
And, the more we become aware about preventive health care, the more beneficial will it be for the individuals, the family and the society.
Also, extensive work is going on to set up Health Wellness Centres across the country.
Less than a hundred days are now left for the International Yoga Day on 21st June.
On the previous three International Yoga Days, people in our country and people all over the world participated with great zeal and enthusiasm.
This time too, we need to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate our family, friends and all others from now itself to do yoga.
Yoga has to be made popular among the youth, the senior citizens, men and women from all age groups through interesting ways.
Usually, the countrys Television and electronic media do a variety of programmes on Yoga the whole year.
Can we, beginning now, till the Yoga Day, devise a campaign to spread awareness on Yoga
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Efforts are being extensively undertaken to make health care accessible and affordable, make it easily accessible and affordable for the common man.
More such centres are being opened.
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to provide this information about Jan Anshadhi Kendras to the needy ones it will cut their expense on medicines.
This will be a big help to them.
The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
In the present 479 medical colleges, MBBS seats have been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in various states with a view to providing better treatment and health facilities to people across the country.
One new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
This is an enormous task.
Your cooperation is needed to create public awareness.
All of us will need to make united efforts to become TB-free.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
The whole world is looking at India as a hub for investment innovation and development.
That the development of industries could only be possible in the cities, was the kernel of the idea of Dr. Baba Sahib Ambedkar and that was the reason he banked upon urbanization of India.
He also believed that poverty cannot be ameliorated by mere distribution of capital among the impoverished.
Today our monetary policy, Start Up India, Stand Up India initiative have become seedbed for our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
He stressed the utilization of water for the development of the nation The genesis of different river valley authorities, different water related commissions - all these were possible due to the vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today there are landmark efforts, being embarked upon for waterways and ports in our country.
New seaports are being constructed on a number of seaways of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
In the era of 40s, while most of the discussions were centred around the Second World War, the looming Cold war and the partition it was during those times Dr.
Ambedkar had laid the foundation of Team India's spirit in a way.
He had talked about the importance of federalism, federal system and stressed on Center and states working together for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted in all aspects of governance the mantra of co-operative federalism and going a step further, we have adopted competitive cooperative federalism but most importantly, Dr.
But, the picture of New India is altogether different.
Ambedkar from April 14 to May 5 Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan, is being organized.
Under the aegis of this campaign, separate programmes on village development, poverty amelioration and social justice will be held throughout India.
I urge you all to be a part of this campaign.
My dear countrymen, a spectrum of many festivals would dawn upon us in the next few days- Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and the Baisakhi.
The day of Bhagwan Mahavir's birth anniversary is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavirji, the apostle of non-violence will inspire us all.
I extend felicitations to all on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
The very mention of Easter reminds us of the inspirational preaching of Lord Jesus Christ which has always impressed on mankind the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and in parts of western India in April
All of these festivals are connected in one way or another to our fields and granaries, and through these festivals, we thank nature for the priceless gifts we receive as produce.
Once again, my best wishes to you all on the occasion of the festivals coming our way.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
The same question gave rise to a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about Science, the first name that strikes us is that of Bharat Ratna Sir C.
One of his discoveries is famous as the Raman Effect.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great Mathematicians like Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupt and Aryabhatt
on the other, in the field of medicine, Sushrut Charak have bestowed upon us a place of pride.
Right from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose have brought laurels to India.
The famous particle BOSON has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently I got an opportunity to take part in a programme in Mumbai the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was interesting to know about the ongoing miraculous accomplishments in the field of Science.
Artificial Intelligence aids in making robots, Bots and other machines meant for specific tasks.
Through self learning, machines today can enhance their intelligence to a smarter level.
This technology can be harnessed to better the lives of the underprivileged, the marginalized and the needy.
In that programme on Artificial Intelligence, I urged the scientific community to deliberate on how Artificial Intelligence could help us make life easier for our divyang brothers sisters.
A few days ago, I got an opportunity to accompany the Prime Minister of Israel to Ahmedabad, Gujarat for the inauguration of I create.
There a young person referred to developing a digital instrument that converts the written word into voice.
I feel we can harness Artificial Intelligence in many such fields.
Science and Technology are value neutral.
They dont possess any value in themselves.
Any machine will work the way we want it to.
It entirely depends on us what task we want it to perform.
Here human objectives assume significance
the use of Science for the sole purpose of human welfare, with the endeavour to assist human lives touch the greatest heights.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, failed many a time in his experiments.
Coincidentally, I am fortunate today to be in Auroville, the land, the karmabhoomi of Maharshi Arvind.
Thus, as a great sage, he questioned every facet of life.
Extracting answers, he showed the right path to humanity.
The relentless quest to ask questions for knowing the truth is very important.
I congratulate our scientists, and all those connected with Science on the occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, safety in the times of crises, disasters are topics on which many messages keep coming in- people keep writing to me.
In a comment posted on Narendra Modi Mobile App, Shriman Ravindra Singh from Pune has referred to occupational safety.
He writes that in our country, safety standards at factories and construction sites are not upto the mark.
Since the 4th of March is National Safety Day, the Prime Minister should include safety in the Mann Ki Baat programme in order to raise awareness on safety.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, if we are not able to attain a certain level, it will get extremely difficult during the time of disasters.
We often read signboards on streets bearing lines such as Lose alertness invite mishaps or , One mistake can cost you dear- rob you of your joy smile or , Dont be in a hurry to leave this world embrace the culture of safety or Dont play around with safety, your life will be treated cheap.
Beyond that, these sentences serve no purpose in our lives.
most of the mishaps are a consequence of some mistake or the other on our part.
If we stay alert, abide by the prescribed rules regulations, we shall not only be able to save our own lives but we can prevent catastrophes harming society.
There are times when we come across many slogans on safety at the work place but none following their letter and spirit.
I urge the fire brigade under corporations and municipalities to visit school children once a week or once a month and perform mock drills for them.
As far as disasters are concerned, this country has borne the brunt of many a natural as well as man made disaster, such as chemical industrial mishaps.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority, NDMA is the vanguard when it comes to dealing with disasters in the country.
During earthquakes, floods, cyclones, landslides, NDMA reaches the area within no time. They have issued guidelines
simultaneously they keep imparting training on a regular basis for capacity building.
In Districts prone to floods and cyclones, an initiative names Aapada Mitra has been launched for training Volunteers.
Training and awareness have a very important role to play.
Two- three years ago, thousands of people would lose their lives every year due to heat-wave.
In 2017, the death toll on account of heat wave remarkably came down to around 220 or so.
This proves that if we accord priority to safety, we can actually attain safety.
I laud the role played by innumerable individuals, citizens who immediately embark upon rescue and relief operations wherever a disaster strikes.
India has made a pioneering effort BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan Nepal a joint disaster management exercise involving these countries was undertaken.
It was a novel humanitarian experiment on a large scale.
Well have to make it part of our life, our being.
In day to day life, during air travel, we must have frequently come across air hostesses giving out a rather longish speech, safety instructions at the beginning of a flight.
We must have heard it hundreds of times.
But today if one of us is taken inside an aircraft and asked about the location of equipments, say life jackets, and how to use them, I can say for sure that none of us will be able to give the right answer.
Was there a scope of direct visibility when the information was given
Of course there was.
But we did not respond actively.
And that is why our ears hear when we sit in the aircraft, but no one realizes that these instructions are for me.
We experience this in all walks of life.
Let us not think that safety is only meant for someone else.
If all of us become conscious and aware of our own safety, the essence of safety of society will be inbuilt.
My dear countrymen, in the current budget, emphasis has been laid on turning waste to wealth and waste to energy through Bio gas, under the Swachch Bharat Campaign.
An effort was initiated which was named GOBAR-Dhan - Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
The aim of this GOBAR- DHAN scheme is ensuring cleanliness in villages and generating wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid agricultural waste into Compost and Bio Gas.
India is home to the highest cattle population in the world, close to 300 million in number, with a daily output of 3 million tonnes of dung.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other Bio-waste to produce energy.
But India was lacking full capacity utilization.
Under the Swachch Bharat Mission (Rural), we are taking rapid strides in this direction.
A target has been set to use cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste to produce Bio gas based energy.
Under the Gobardhan Scheme our farmer brothers sisters in rural India will be encouraged to consider dung and other waste not just as a waste but as a source of income.
It will be easier to keep the village clean and sanitized, livestock health will improve and farm yields will increase.
Biogas generation will increase self-reliance in energy utilized for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and cattle herders will be helped in augmenting their income.
There will be novel opportunities for newer jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created for better implementation of 'Gobar Dhan Yojana', it will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially our sisters residing in rural India, to step forward, and through creation of self-help groups and cooperative societies extract full advantage from this opportunity.
I invite you to become part of the movement comprising clean energy and green jobs, to become a part of the initiative to convert waste in your village to wealth and by converting dung into Gobar dhan.
My dear countrymen, till date, we have been hearing about the myriad types of festivals - be it music festivals, food festivals, film festivals and many other kinds of festivals.
But in a unique endeavor in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state's first 'Trash Mahotsav' was organized.
The objective behind this festival sponsored by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to generate awareness about cleanliness and the methods using which city's waste can be creatively used and inculcate awareness about various ways to recycle the garbage.
A plethora of activities were organized during this festival, which found full participation of students and adults.
Raipur inspired various types of such garbage or trash festivals in other districts too.
Every year on March 8, 'International Women's Day' is celebrated.
There are many programs that are held in our country and the world.
Today the country is moving forward from the path of Women development to women-led development.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda. Hed said 'The idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence' - This idea of Swami ji about one hundred and twenty five years ago expresses the contemplation of woman power in Indian culture.
We are part of a tradition where men were identified due to women-Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Putra, these were identities of a son.
I just received news from Jharkhand wherein under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan', about 1.
5 million women in Jharkhand and this figure is not a small one organized a hygiene campaign for an entire month
Under the auspices of this campaign starting from January 26, 2018, these women constructed 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days and made a record of sorts.
You can imagine what a mammoth undertaking it was
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will change the course of the campaign of cleanliness in general life, the effective role of hygiene in the nature of the people ingeneral.
My dear Brothers and sisters, I was just watching the TV news two days ago that electricity has reached three villages of the Elephanta island after 70 years of independence, and this has led to much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know very well, that Elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from Mumbai.
I congratulate the administration and the populace there.
There is no greater contentment and joy than the fact that the lives of the countrymen be full of shine and there be happiness in their lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
And now the month of March beckons us with ripe crops in the fields, playful golden earrings of wheat and the captivating blossom of mango pleasing to the mind are the highlights of this month.
But this month is also very special to all of us because of the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March the entire country immersed in joy will celebrate the festival of Holi.
In The festival of Holi, the importance of colors is as important as the ceremony of 'HolikaDahan' because it is the day when we burn our inherent vices in the fire.
Holi makes us forget our rancours and gives us an opportunity to be a part of each other's happiness and glad tidings, and it conveys the message of love, unity and brotherhood.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first episode of Mann Ki Baat in the year 2018.
Just a couple of days ago, we celebrated our Republic Day festival with gaiety fervour.
This is the very first time in history that heads of 10 Nations attended the ceremony.
He writes, The 1st of February is the death anniversary of astronaut Kalpana Chawla.
She left us in the Columbia space shuttle mishap, but not without becoming a source of inspiration for millions of young people the world over.
If one possesses the will the determination, a firm resolve to achieve something, nothing is impossible.
Its a matter of joy that women in India are taking rapid strides of advancement in all fields, bringing glory to the Nation.
In our country, respect for women, their status in society and their contribution has proved to be awe inspiring to the entire world, since ancient times.
There has been a long tradition of Vidushis...
Many Vidushis of India have contributed in composing the verses of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee...
Today, we talk about Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, save the girl child, educate her. But centuries ago, it has been mentioned in our ancient texts, in the Skand Puran :-, R:, This means, a daughter is the equivalent of ten sons.
The Punya that you earn through ten sons amounts to the same earned through just one daughter.
This underscores the importance that has been given to women in our society.
Be it the erudition of the Vidushis of the Vedic Period... Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee
be it the learning devotion of Akka Mahadevi or Meerabai, be it the governance of Ahilyabai Holkar or the valour of Rani Lakshmibai, woman power has always inspired us.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has further cited some examples.
He writes that the flight of our courageous Defence Minister Nirmala Seetharaman in a Sukhoi 30 fighter plane is inspirational for him.
Three braveheart women Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on the Sukhoi- 30.
An Air India Boeing jet with an all woman crew led by Kshamata Vajpayee flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and back.
Today women are not just advancing in myriad fields they are leaders.
Today there are many sectors where our woman power is playing a pioneering role, establishing milestones.
A few days ago, Honble President took an initiative.
A book has been compiled on these women achievers, first ladies, so that, the entire country comes to know about the power of these women and derive inspiration from their life work.
This is also available as an e-book on the Narendra Modi Website.
The countrys woman power has contributed a lot in the positive transformation being witnessed in our country society these days.
Today, as we speak of women empowerment, I would like to refer to a railway station.
You must be wondering what a railway station has got to do with women empowerment.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India which is run by an all woman staff.
All departments have women performing duties...
the commercial department, Railway Police, Ticket checking, Announcing, Point persons, its a staff comprising over 40 women.
This time, after watching the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that a major highlight of the parade was the BSF biker contingent comprising women participants.
Daredevil stunts performed by them was awe inspiring for our foreign guests.
Empowerment is another form of self reliance.
Today our Nari Shakti is assuming leadership roles.
It is becoming self reliant.
By the way, this also reminds me of tribal women of Chattisgarh, who have done something extraordinary and set a remarkable example.
When we refer to Adivasi women, a stereotypical image comes to our minds, comprising jungles, pathways in the woods and women carrying kindlewood on their heads.
But the woman power of Chattisgarh, the tribal women there broke this stereotype presented an all new picture of themselves.
Dantewada in Chattisgarh is a Maoist infested region. Violence, torture, explosives, guns, pistols...
In this dangerous atmosphere, Adivasi women are becoming self reliant by driving e-rickshaws.
In a short span of time, a number of women have become part of this phenomenon.
This has three benefits- on the one hand self-employment has empowered them
Leaving out things that are beyond the constraints of time and accepting betterment in things wherever necessary.
And this is a salient feature of our society...
relentless efforts towards self-improvement, self correction.
Just a while ago, Bihar launched an interesting initiative.
In order to uproot social ills in the state, the worlds longest human chain spanning over thirteen thousand kilometers was formed.
This campaign made people aware of social maladies such as child-marriage and the dowry system.
The entire state thus resolved to fight against these social evils.
Children, the elderly, the youth full of energy and enthusiasm, women, girls turned out to participate in this battle.
The human chain that commenced formation from Gandhi Maidan in Patna gained momentum, touching the state borders.
In order to ensure that the fruits of progress rightly reach all sections of society, it is imperative that our society is freed of these ills.
Come, let us pledge to come together to wipe out these evil customs from our social fabric...
let us build an empowered, capable New India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister, the administration, in fact every member of the human chain for this massive, special initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka has written on My gov. He was undergoing an expenditure of six thousand rupees a month on medicines alone for the treatment of his father.
Earlier, he wasnt aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But now that hes come to know of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has begun purchasing medicines from there and his expenses have been reduced by about 75.
Medicines available at the Jan Aushadhi Centres are 50 to 90 cheaper than branded drugs available in the market.
This is great help for the common man, especially for senior citizens who require medicines on a daily basis and results in a lot of savings.
That is why good quality medicines are made available at affordable prices.
Today, over three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This has led to not only availability of cheaper medicines, but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are now available at Amrit Stores at Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Centres at hospitals.
The sole aim behind this step is ensuring availability of uality affordable health service to the poorest of the poor, so that a healthy prosperous India comes into being.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
It was such a striking photo that my attention was magnetically drawn towards it.
The photo showed that a grandson was participating in the 'Clean Morna River' along with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'.
The Morna river was a perennial river flowing throughout the twelve months of the year but now it has become seasonal.
The second painful fact was that the river was completely filled with wild grass and hyacinth.
A lot of garbage was being dumped into the river and along its banks.
An action plan was chalked out and on January 13th a day before Makar-Sankranti, in the first phase of 'Mission Clean Morna' sanitation of the two sides of the bank of the Morna river at fourteen places spread over an area of four kilometers, was carried out.
Huge social reforms can be brought about through mass movements.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the municipal corporations administration, all the citizens who were associated with this mass movement, I laud your efforts which are not only very much appreciated but this will inspire the other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you must be hearing a lot about the Padma Awards.
These awards also attract attention in newspapers and television also.
There was a certain methodology of awarding Padma Awards every year, but this entire process has been changed for the past three years.
Now any citizen can nominate any person in our country.
Transparency has been brought about in the entire process by making it operable online.
He has been making toys from garbage for over four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science.
He has been trying to get children inspired to conduct scientific experiments using waste
towards this end he has been encouraging children by showing them films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
What a wonderful life, what a dedicated mission
You must have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He was employed in a small job for eking out his living, but he was also fond of painting in the traditional tribal art form.
Today, due to this hobby, he garnered respect not only in India but the entire world.
He has exhibited his paintings in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who made India proud in many nations abroad, was also recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri.
You will be pleasantly surprised listening to the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutti.
Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still resides in a hut made of palm leaves in a tribal tract amidst dense forests.
She has created five hundred herbal medicines relying solely on her memory.
She has mastery in synthesizing medicines used for treatment of snake bites.
Lakshmi Ji is continuously serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who, in order to construct a hospital, cleaned utensils in the homes of others and also sold vegetables.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in this hospital that has come up through hard-work.
These people should be invited to schools and colleges to share their experiences.
Beyond awards, there should be some more efforts from our society in acknowledging their contribution.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on January 9th every year.
It was on the 9th of January, when our revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond that exists between Indians in India and Indians living around the globe.
This year we organized a program on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, where all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin were invited.
You will be pleased to know that in this programme, Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Surinam, South Africa and America, and many other countries wherever our Mayors or MPs of Indian Origin exist, all of them participated.
whether working in the field of cyber security, or dedicated to Ayurveda, entertaining the society through music, or through poetry
I would thus like to thank the European Union, for recognizing the people of Indian origin and through them in making people in India and people the world over aware of their exemplary work.
The 30th of January is the death anniversary of our revered Bapu, who showed us a new path.
On that day we also observe 'martyrs day' in solemn memory of the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the defense of the country and pay our homage at 11 in the morning.
They were not just mere theories.
At present we witness at every step how accurate Bapu's words were.
What can be a bigger tribute than taking a vow that we shall tread the path of Bapu - and walk, as far as possible
Mann Ki Baat December 2017
This is the last edition of Mann Ki Baat this year and its a coincidence that this day happens to be the last day of the year of 2017.
A few hours later, the year will change, but this sequence of our conversation will go on, just the way it is.
People in India too celebrated Christmas with warmth and cheer.
The pious occasion of Christmas reminds us of the great teachings of Jesus Christ who laid much emphasis on the spirit of service, Sewa bhaav.
The essence of the spirit of service can be felt in the Bible too.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The illustrious life of Guru Gobind Singh ji, full of instances of courage sacrifice is a source of inspiration to all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached the virtues of sublime human values and at the same time, practiced them in his own life in letter spirit.
A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, Guru Gobind Singh ji, in all these roles, performed the great task of inspiring people.
He fought against oppression injustice.
His teachings to people focused on breaking the cordons of caste and religion.
In this endeavour, he stood to lose a lot on his personal front.
But he never let antagonism raise its ugly head in his path.
Im fortunate that at the beginning of this year, I got an opportunity to participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebration organized at Patna Sahib.
People born in the year 2000 or later those born in the 21st century will gradually begin to become eligible voters from the 1st of January, 2018.
As voters of this century, you too must be feeling proud.
You too can be the makers of 21st century India and this opportunity comes into being, very specially, on the 1st of January.
And today, in this edition of Mann Ki Baat, I wish to speak to our successful young men women between 18 25, all infused with energy and resolve.
I consider them New India Youth, New India Youth stands for aspirations, enthusiasm energy.
I firmly believe that the dream of our New India will be realized through the skill fortitude of these energetic youth.
When we talk of new India then that new India will be free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption free from filth and poverty.
In the New India everyone will have equal opportunity and aspirations and wishes of everyone will be fulfilled.
New India will be a place where peace, unity and amity will be our guiding force.
My New India Youth should come forward and deliberate on how this New India would be formed.
One should decide ones own path and also decide a way for connecting along those attached to one and the Caravan should get going.
You should move forward and thus should the country move ahead.
Right now, while taking to you I got an idea whether we could organize a mock parliament in every district of India
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
Nothing is impossible for a man having positivity and zeal.
In English too, it is said, Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.
During the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share their positive moments of 2017 and to welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere.
I am very glad that a large number of people gave positive responses on social media platform, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Lakhs of tweets were posted on Positive India hashtag (), which reached out to more than nearly 150 crore people.
In a way, a wave of positivity which emanated from India spread all over the world.
All tweets and responses received were really inspiring.
Some people even shared their personal achievements.
SOUND BITE My name is Meenu Bhatia.
I reside in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-1, Phase- I, Delhi.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Waade.
He died in an accident.
Only we know of the situation we faced at that time.
Assistance from the government helped us a lot and I could gather the strength to stand myself.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
A national highway has been constructed in 2017 through our village Bhinnar.
As a result of this, our roads have improved a lot and business there will surely get a boost.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja.
I live in Mohalla Saadatganj, district Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
These are without parallel.
My name is Satish Bewani.
So, this is our achievement in 2017.
There are a large number of such persons who have brought in positive transformation in the lives of many people through endeavour at their own level.
When we all talk of positivity, I also feel like sharing one experience.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak who is a topper in Kashmir Administrative Service Examination.
He actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism and hatred and topped in the Kashmir Administrative Examination.
You will be surprised to know that terrorists had set his ancestral home on fire in 1990.
Terrorism and violence were so widespread there that his family had to leave their ancestral land and flee from there.
For a young child, such an atmosphere of violence could easily create darkness and bitterness in the heart, but Anjum did not let it be so.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself a path of serving the people.
He overcame the adverse situation and scripted his own success story.
Today, he has become a source of inspiration not only in Jammu Kashmir but for the youth of the whole country.
Anjum has proved that however adverse the circumstances be, the clouds of despair and disappointment can easily be cleared by taking positive steps.
Just last week, I had a chance of meeting some daughters of Jammu Kashmir.
I was amazed at the spirit that they had, the enthusiasm that was there in their hearts and the dreams they nurtured. I was listening to them on how they wanted to make progress in various facets of life and, how their lives were filled with hope.
I talked to them, there was no sign of despair
there was only enthusiasm, optimism, energy, dreams and a sense of resolve.
These are the strength of our nation, they are my youth, they are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a reference to famous religious places, not only of India but of the whole world, it is very natural to mention about the Sabrimala temple of Kerala.
Millions of devotees come to this world famous temple, seeking blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
It is a huge challenge maintaining cleanliness around such a large religious place where devotees in such huge number come.
And especially, since this place is situated in the midst of hills and forests.
But, Sabrimala temple in itself is an example to show how this challenge could be converted into a sanskar, a habit and what a tremendous strength public participation has
One police officer P.
Vijayan initiated a programme Punyam Poonkavanam and commenced a voluntary campaign of creating awareness on cleanliness.
Every devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a part of the Lords worship.
Every morning, there is a uniquely pleasant scene of cleanliness here when all devotees join in the drive.
However big a celebrity be, or however rich one might be or however high an official be each one contributes as an ordinary devotee in this Punyan Poonkavanam programme and becomes a part of this cleanliness drive.
There are many such examples before us.
This cleanliness drive in Sabrimala and the contribution of Punyan Poonkavanam in this are so immense that each devotee contributes and participates in it.
Here, a strong resolve of maintaining cleanliness also is as important as the strict discipline observed during worship.
My dear countrymen, all of us made a resolve on Bapus birth anniversary on October 2, 2014 to take forward Bapus unfinished task of building a Clean India and a filth- free India.
And, all of us took a resolve that on the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we shall make some contribution in the direction of making Clean India which he had dreamt of.
Efforts in the direction of cleanliness are being widely taken across the whole country.
A change can now be seen in the form of public participation in rural and urban areas alike.
Cleanliness Survey 2018, the largest in the world, will be conducted from the 4th of January to 10th of March, 2018 to evaluate achievements in cleanliness level of our urban areas.
This survey will cover a population of more than 40 crores in more than four thousand cities.
During this survey, the matters to be surveyed include freedom from defecation in the open in cities, collection of garbage, transport facilities to lift garbage, processing of garbage using scientific methods, efforts to usher in behavioural changes, innovative steps taken for capacity building to maintain cleanliness and public participation in this campaign.
Separate teams will go to cities for inspection.
They will talk to the people there and gather their reactions.
They will analyse the use of the Cleanliness App and also about bringing reforms and improvements in various kinds of service centres.
It will also be observed whether the cities have created a system wherein cleanliness of cities will became public habit, or the citys habit for that matter.
It is not for the government alone to maintain cleanliness.
Every citizen and peoples organizations have a big responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to actively participate in the Cleanliness Survey to be undertaken in the coming days.
And take the full onus to ensure that your city should not lag behind and your street or mohalla should not look to be wanting.
I am very sure that using blue and green dustbins to collect dry and wet garbage respectively must have become your habit by now.
For waste- collection the principle of reduce, reuse and re-cycle is very effective.
Be sure that you do not remain lagging behind in the Cleanliness Survey to be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018. This should become the talking point in every city.
And all of you must have a dream Our city our efforts, Our progress countrys progress.
Let us all, once again remembering revered Bapu and taking a resolve to build a Clean India, put in our best endeavours.
My dear countrymen, there are a few things which appear small but they have a far reaching impact on our image as a society.
Today, in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
Who would have drafted such rules
Why this discrimination
And when I went into the depth of the matter I was surprised to find that - even after seventy years of our independence, we were the ones who had imposed these restrictions.
For decades, injustice was being rendered to Muslim women but there was no discussion on it.
Even in many Islamic countries this practice does not exist.
But Muslim women in India did not have this right.
And I'm glad that our government paid heed to this matter.
Usually there is a lottery system for selection of Haj pilgrims but I would like that single women pilgrims should be excluded from this lottery system and they should be given a chance as a special category.
It should be our constant endeavor that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities just like men get so that they can proceed simultaneously on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for all of us.
But 26th January, 2018, will especially be remembered through the ages.
The Republic Day will be celebrated with leaders of all ten ASEAN countries coming to India as Chief Guests.
This time, not one but Ten chief guests would grace the Republic Day.
This is unprecedented in India's history.
The year 2017 has been special for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years of formation in 2017 and in 2017 25 years of India's partnership with ASEAN were completed.
On 26th January the arrival of great leaders of 10 nations of the world as a unit is a matter of pride for all Indians.
May the New Year bring greater happiness, glad tidings and prosperity for all of you.
Let us move forward with all renewed zeal, enthusiasm, fervor and new resolve.
The month of January is the period of the northward movement of the Earth on the celestial orbit around sun and in this month Makar-Sankranti is also celebrated.
This is a festival linked with nature.
Though all of our festivals are associated with nature in one way or the other, but in our country blessed with the bounty of cultural diversity, there are different ways to celebrate this wonderful episode of nature in different forms.
In Rajasthan, it is called Sankrant, Magh-bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu - all these festivals are special in their own right and they have their own importance.
All of these festivals are usually celebrated between 13th and 17thJanuary.
Felicitations to all of you on the occasion of these festivals.
And once again, best wishes for the New Year 2018 to all of you.
I Thank you my dear countrymen.
We shall converse again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There must be hardly an Indian citizen who does not show deep regard for her, does not revere her.
She is elder to most of us and has been a witness to myriad phases, different eras the country has passed through.
. Lata Didi.
She turns ninety this 28th of September.
Before leaving on the foreign tour, I was blessed with an opportunity to converse with her on the phone.
This chat was akin to a younger brother speaking to his elder sister affectionately.
I usually refrain from sharing such personal conversations but today, I want you to listen to the tete a tete
Modi Ji : Lata Didi, Pranaam.
This is Narendra Modi speaking.
Lata Didi: Pranaam.
Lata Didi: I was touched when I came to know that you would be giving me a call.
When are you returning
Modi Ji : I am returning in the intervening night of the 28th the 29th, slightly past your birthday.
Lata Didi: Okay, Okay.
Whats there to celebrate on a Birthday
Lata Didi: I seek your blessings.
Modi Ji : It is we who seek your blessings, you are much elder to us.
Modi Ji : And it gives me joy when you proudly say that your mother was a Gujarati.
Our close bond feels like family and gives me immense joy.
I do not wish to trouble you further, since I can see how busy you are with myriad pressures on the work front.
There are so many things that you have to think of.
But I shall come very soon to your place.
And I would love you to feed me a Gujarati dish.
The ensuing weeks shall be witness to the sparkle of festivals throughout the country.
All of us shall celebrate the NavaratriMahotsava, Garba, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali, BhaiyaDooj, Chhath Puja... .
for us, it is an order a philosophical thought, or an inspiration.
There are homes where sweetmeats are left to rot there are homes where children yearn for a sweet
At least in our homes, items that are in excess and thus, not required anymore, could be allocated for Delivery Out.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from homes, look for the needy and hand them over discreetly.
In our culture, daughters are considered Laxmi, since they are harbinger of fortune and prosperity.
Can we, this time around in society, organize programmes to felicitate daughters in villages, towns and cities
It could be in the form of a public function.
There must be numerous daughters amongst us who, through there perseverance, diligence and talent have brought glory to their families, society and the country.
Our society must recognize such daughters, honor them and feel proud of them.
Programmes to felicitate them should be held throughout the country.
We could do something more we could highlight the achievements of these daughters by sharing their achievements on social media, using the hashtag BHARAT KI LAMI.
A few days ago, AleenaTaayang, a student from far off Arunachal has written an interesting letter to me.
I hail from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
On my exam result this time, some people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors
My experience after that has been very good.
I felt, had I read the book before my exams, I wouldve benefitted a great deal.
if you are thinking anew on a new edition, do include a few mantras for parents and teachers and of course new content. See...
even my young friends bear this trust that whatever they ask the Pradhan Sevak, the principal servant of the country to do
My young student friends, first of all, I thank you for writing to me.
At the same time, my little friend has entrusted me with a task, in fact there are orders for me.
But I urge all of you...
can you be of help to me
It is about experiences in your daily lives.
Ill give it due thought and whatever comes across as apt, I shall try and incorporate that in my own words.
So, I shall eagerly wait for your thoughts to flow.
Once again, I express my gratitude to our little friend, student Aleena Taayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you update yourselves with the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and television, you even discuss the engagements.
If you havent heard Medvedevs speech yet, I shall urge you, especially young friends to watch this video.
The wisdom of our ancestors is truly praiseworthy.
Our ancient texts observe: : Meaning, when ability and humility amalgamate in a person, whose heart will he not be able to win over
As a matter of fact, this young player has won the hearts of people across the globe.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to tellyou now is directly for your benefit.
Tobacco intoxication occurs due to the nicotine present in it.
Brain development is hampered by its consumption during adolescence.
But, today, I want to have a discourse with you on a new topic.
You must be knowing that, recently the e-cigarette got banned in India.
An e-cigarette is a type of electronic device unlike a typical cigarette.
In ane-cigarette, theheating of nicotine-containing fluids creates a type of chemical smoke and this is the pathway through which nicotine is consumed.
Like the conventional cigarette, it does not spread odour as fragrant chemicals are added to it.
We have seen around us, that, even if the father in any house is a chain smoker, still he tries to stop the rest of the household from smoking and wants his children not to fall prey to the habit of cigarettes or bidis.
His effort is that no family member should take to smoking.
He knows that smoking or tobacco causes great damage to the body.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are added to e-cigarettes, which have a deleterious effect on health.
You are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us, we come to know about it through its odour.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in someones pocket, the smell can be detected.
However, this is not the case with an e-cigarette and many teenagers and young people, unknowingly and sometimes proudly displaying an e-cigaretteas a fashion statement, keep itbetwixt their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes hold it in their hands and thus fall prey to it.
The younger generation is the future of our country.
I urge all of you to quit the addiction to tobacco and do not harbour any misconceptions about e-cigarettes.
Fit India does not mean that if we go to the gym for two hours every morning and evening, it will suffice
All these addictions have to be avoided to be a part of Fit India.
India has not only been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, but also the land of their karma.
And these are the people who have spent themselves in service of others.
One such illustrious Indian is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that, on the coming 13thOctober, His Holiness Pope Francis will declare Sister MariamThresia a saint.
Sister MariamThresia, in her short lifespan of 50 years, worked for the good of humanity becominganoble example for the entire world.
She rendered service in the fields of education and social service.
I once again pay heart felt tributes to Sister MariamThresia and congratulate the citizens of India, and especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
In India, citizens are contributing in this campaign in their own way.
But, a young man from our country has initiated a very unique campaign.
as far as sanitation and cleanliness, along with fitness levels.
I do believe that a single step towards freedom from single use plastic taken by 130 crore countrymen will give India a lead by a 130 crore steps.
Ripudaman ji, once again, many thanks to you.
And to your team, and your imaginative, innovative bent of mind, heartiest congratulations from my side.
My dear countrymen, groundwork for 2ndOctober is going on all over the country and also the world over, but we want to transmute 'Gandhi 150' as a task on the path of our duty.
hence for that reason, every year on 31 October, we run for fostering unison in the country as 'Run for Unity', all over the nation.
So, better start preparing from this instant onwards
My dear countrymen, the 27th of September, two days prior to today, was celebrated as World Tourism Day and you will be happy to know that certain reputed tourism agencies of the world which rank standards of travel tourism have shown that India has displayed a lot of improvement in the Travel Tourism Competitive Index.
And all this has been possible due to your cooperation and especially because understanding the importance of tourism has increased.
My dear countrymen, once again I wish you all the best for various festivals that would be celebrated in the oncoming season in India, which is filled with diversity
Mann Ki Baat November 2017
My dear countrymen, namaskar
A while ago, I had a chance to have an indirect dialogue, with young friends from Karnataka.
I read those letters and liked the initiative.
Kirti Hegde from North Kannada had appreciated Digital India and Smart City schemes and she put forth a suggestion that we need to transform our education system and said that the present-day children do not like classroom reading, they love to know more and more about nature.
And if we impart knowledge about nature to our children then in future they may prove very useful in protecting the environment.
A child Reeda Nadaf from Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of an army man and feels proud of being so.
Which Indian would not be proud of our soldiers
And, you being a soldier daughter should naturally take pride in that.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has written that her school is 5 Kilometres away from her village and she has to start early in the morning and it gets quite late in the evening by the time she returns home.
But, my countrymen, I liked this initiative taken by a newspaper that helped these letters reach me and I got an opportunity to go through these.
This was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
The 26th of November is our Constitution Day.
The Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on this day in the year nineteen forty-nine.
Our constitution was implemented on the 26th of January, 1950 which we celebrate as our Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the spirit of our democracy.
This is the day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They all worked hard for about three years to draft the Constitution.
And, whoever reads that debate will feel proud about what actually the vision of a life dedicated to the nation is.
Can you imagine how hard their task would have been to frame the Constitution of our country which has such big diversities
They must have shown a great sense of understanding and farsightedness and that too at a juncture when the country was getting rid of the bondage of slavery.
Now, this is the responsibility of all of us to make a New India in the light of the thinking of the makers of our Constitution.
Our Constitution is all encompassing.
It guarantees fundamental rights to each every citizen, whether underprivileged or oppressed, backward or deprived, a tribal or a woman. It protects their fundamental rights and safeguards their interests.
It is our duty that we abide by our Constitution in letter and spirit.
Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day today.
Seventeen separate committees were constituted by the Constituent Assembly on various important issues.
One of most significant of these was the drafting committee and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of this drafting committee.
He was playing a pivotal role in it.
The Constitution of India, which we feel so very proud of, bears an indelible stamp of his able leadership.
He ensured the welfare of every section of society.
We remember him and bow before him on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas on 6th of December.
15th of December is the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Sardar Patel rose from being a farmers son to be known as the Iron Man of the country, undertaking the extraordinary task of uniting India into one nation.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
The country remembers and bows to those brave citizens, policemen, security men and each one who lost their lives then.
This country can never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism has taken an ugly shape and has become a global threat almost as a daily routine.
We, in India, are facing to lot for the last 40 years on account of terrorism.
Thousands of our innocent people have lost their lives.
It is bent upon destroying the humanitarian forces.
So, not only India but all humanitarian forces will have to keep fighting unitedly to defeat the menace of terrorism.
Lord Budha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi this is the land which gave the message of love and non-violence to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social fabric.
That is why, the need of the hour is that humanitarian forces should become more alert and cautious.
My dear countrymen, we shall observe Navy Day on the 4th of December.
Be it the Indus, the Ganges, the Yamuna or the Saraswati our rivers and seas are both economically and strategically important.
These are our gateway to the whole world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable bond with oceans.
And as we peep into our history, we come to know that about 800 to 900 (eight to nine hundred) years ago, during the rule of the Cholas, the Chola Navy was considered one of the strongest navies.
This navy had a big role in the expansion of the Chola-rule and in making it an economic super power.
Numerous references of voyages and expeditions of the Chola-Navy are found even today in Sangam - literature.
Very few people might be aware that most navies of the world allowed women on their warships pretty later.
But in the Chola Navy, a large number of women played leading roles and that too about eight to nine hundred years ago
to the extent that women actively took part in battles.
The Chola rulers possessed a very rich and sound knowledge of ship building.
Konkan coast, where the sea has a significant role, was under Shivaji Maharajs realm.
Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarn Durg, etc were either situated on the sea coast or were encircled by sea.
The security of these forts was the responsibility of the Maratha Navy.
There was a combination of large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
His naval forces were very efficient and skilled in attacking the enemy and in defending their attacks.
And how can we refer to the Maratha Navy and not remember Kanhoji Aangre
He took the Maratha Navy to newer heights and established Maratha Naval Bases at a number of places.
After Independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions be it the liberation struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pak war.
many fishermen were rescued from the sea and handed over to Bangladesh.
In May-June this year when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our navy reached there immediately and helped the government and the people there.
In September, during the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, our naval ship INS GHADIYAL delivered humanitarian assistance there.
Carrying medical services to FIJI, sending urgent relief, or delivering humanitarian aid during crisis to a neighbouring country our navy has always rendered glorious service.
They sacrifice their youth for the country so that 125 crore countrymen may live in peace.
We observe ARMED FORCES FLAG DAY every year on 7th December.
This is a day to feel proud of and show respect to our countrys armed forces.
A movement to instill respect for our forces will come into being in the country.
People from the forces could be invited to schools and colleges to share information about the forces.
Our new generation can get a good opportunity to get information about the forces.
This is also an occasion to collect funds for the welfare of the jawans of our armed forces.
This amount is spent through the Sainik Kalyan Board on the dependents of those who lost their lives and also for those who got injured during wars, for their rehabilitation.
Come, let us do something on this occasion which may raise the morale of our armed forces.
We should also contribute towards their welfare.
My dear countrymen, World Soil Day is on the 5th of December.
I want to tell something to my farmer brothers and sisters.
An important component of the Earth is soil.
Whatever we eat is linked only to this soil.
In a way, the complete food chain is connected to soil.
There will be no soil, no plants and trees will grow
how will human life be possible
How will animals and birds survive
This concern was touched upon a long time ago in our culture and that is why we are aware of the significance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, there has been efforts to foster a feeling of devotion and gratitude towards our farms, our soil among the people and at the same time scientific farming methods and techniques have been adopted which provide nutrients to the soil.
In the life of the farmer of this country both aspects have been important- reverence to his soil and preserving nurturing it scientifically.
We all feel proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are rooted to traditions and also take interest in modern science, they keep trying and resolve.
I had heard about the farmers, of Tohoo village in Bhoranj block of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh.
Some enlightened and alert farmers in the village noticed and understood the gravity of the situation, and after that got their soil tested on time and followed the advice about the quantity of fertilizers, micro-nutrients and organic fertilizers to be used.
And, you will be surprised to know about the results achieved after the farmers received the information and guidelines about soil health.
Besides, the soil quality also improved.
And, now the farmer also realizes that proper soil care is needed if production is to be increased and that if we take care of our soil, it will also care for all of us.
Our farmers across the country have got more than 10 crore soil health cards made so that they may understand their soil better and accordingly sow the crop.
We worship mother Earth but have we ever thought as to how much damage is caused to the health of our mother- Earth because of the usage of fertilizers like Urea
This has been proved by all scientific methods that a serious damage is caused because of an excessive use of urea.
All of us are experiencing Global warming, climate change now.
And now, December is knocking on our doors, yet winter is advancing at a leisurely pace.
But the moment winter sets in, we all have experienced that we dont like coming out of our quilts one bit.
Covering 30 to 40 homes everyday, spreading the message of cleanliness, this boy transformed the village into Open defecation free.
Promoting the virtues of cleanliness, this little lad has done inspiring work.
This proves that cleanliness suffers from no barriers of age there are no boundaries.
A child or an elderly person, a woman or a man, everyone needs cleanliness.
And everyone should contribute towards the cause of cleanliness.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are firm in their resolve
they are competent, capable, courageous and determined.
We get to learn something or the other every moment.
They are performing well in every walk of life.
Whether it be the field of sports, any kind of competition or a social initiative, our Divyang brethren are second to none.
You must be aware that our Divyang sportspersons won 4 medals in the Rio Olympics through their stellar performances.
They also emerged champions in the T-20 Cricket World Cup for the Visually Challenged.
Myriad competitions take place all over the country.
Recently, the 17th National Para-Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Divyang brothers sisters from different parts of the country participated displayed their stellar skills.
One of them happens to be 19 year old Jigar Thakkar from Gujarat, whose body suffers from 80 muscle atrophy.
Just look at his fortitude, resolve perseverance.
They will be imparted training at the Centre for excellence at Gandhinagar in Gujarat.
let us move forward with each other, together.
A few days from now, the pious occasion of Id-e-milad-un-nabi will be observed.
Paighambar Hazrat Mohammad Sahab was born on this day.
I extend best wishes to all countrymen.
And I hope that this holy occasion of Id gives us new inspiration, fresh energy and the strength to resolve anew, to foster peace communal amity.
Thank you(End of phone call)You are quite right that 2017 is near completion, and the year 2018 is knocking on the door.
And you have given some sound advice.
But continuing from your point of view I feel like adding something more to it and modifying it a bit.
And as in our villages, our elders, the old people of the village are always reminding us - forget the sorrow but also do not forget the joy.
In our media many interesting events of the year gone by are broadcast again to reflect on the previous year.
Remember to recollect the incidents that inspire others.
If you remember positive events, then you will be in a mood to do good around you.
Positive events provide energy to do good.
Let all of us together witness the strength of this collective momentum and its impact.
And I will definitely share the positive thoughts that arrive on positiveindia (hashtag positive India) with the rest of our denizens in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I will be back amidst you next month, with another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
We will have another opportunity to talk a lot.
Mann Ki Baat October 2017
The unique festival Chhath Pooja is deeply linked with nature worshipping nature.
Surya Jal The Sun Water are central to the veneration in Chhath, whereas utensils made of bamboo clay and tubers are an essential part of the Pooja articles.
In this mega festival of faith, veneration of the rising sun and worship of the setting sun convey a message that is replete with unparalleled Sanskar.
the Chatth Pooja bestows upon us the sanskaar to respect revere those whose setting, whose dusk is imminent.
The expression of the significance of cleanliness in our lives is intrinsic to this festival.
Before the advent of Chatth, people come together to clean up their homes, and along with that cleansing of rivers, lakes, pond banks and pooja locations, that is ghats, with utmost enthusiasm fervour.
It is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
But whenever I look at the overall outcome of Mann Ki Baat, it reinforces my belief, that it is intrinsically, inseparably woven into the warp weft of our common citizens lives, cent per cent.
Take the examples of Khadi and handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti I have always advocated the use of handloom and Khadi. What has it led to
You will be glad to know that on the 17th of this month on the day of Dhanteras, the Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan store in Delhi witnessed a record sale of Rupees one crore, twenty lakhs.
You too must be feeling happy with a sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one Khadi Handloom store.
During Diwali, Khadi gift coupon sales recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise.
Compared to last year, the total sales of Khadi Handicrafts have risen almost by 90.
One can clearly see that today, the youth, the elderly, women, in fact every age group is taking to Khadi handloom.
I can imagine how many weaver families, poor families, and the families working on handlooms must have benefitted from this.
Khadi was Khadi foundation earlier and we talked of Khadi fashion but with my recent experience I can say that after Khadi for nation and Khadi for fashion now, it is becoming Khadi for transformation.
Khadi and handloom have transformed the lives of the poorest of the poor and are emerging as a powerful means of empowering them.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on NarendramodiApp whether there could be an arrangement to send our homemade sweets to the security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our homemade sweets must reach our countrys soldiers.
Luckily I got another chance to celebrate Deepawali with our courageous and brave heart security personnel.
Memories of Diwali celebrations with our security forces in Gurez sector of Jammu Kashmir will stay long cherished in my heart.
On behalf of all our countrymen, I salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the countrys borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice, braving all odds.
Whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their tales of valour.
Many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over.
As UN Peacekeepers, they are bringing glory to the nation in the comity of nations.
United Nations Day was observed recently all over the world on the 24th of October.
Everybody recalls the efforts and constructive role of the UN in establishing peace throughout the world.
And, we are believers in Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam which means the whole world is our family.
And with this belief, India has been cooperating very actively in various important initiatives taken by the UN.
You may be aware that the preface of the Indian Constitution and the preface of the UN Charter both start with the words We the people.
India has always stressed on the importance of equality for women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is a living example of this.
It appears to be a minor change but it reflects a vision of a healthy thought.
Indias most important contribution under the UN umbrella is its role in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
India has always been extending active support to UN Peace Missions.
Many of you may be getting to know this for the first time. More than 18 thousand Indian security personnel have lent their services in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Till August 2017, Indian soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71 Peacekeeping operations undertaken by the UN the world over.
These operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many other parts of the world.
In Congo and Southern Sudan more than twenty thousand patients were treated in hospitals of the Indian army and countless lives were saved.
Indian security forces have not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts with their people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peace keeping efforts.
Later, all countries started sending their women police units.
You will surely feel proud to know that Indias contribution is not limited to just peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to peacekeepers from about eighty five countries.
The brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Budha have sent a message of peace and amity around the world.
Peacekeeping operation is not an easy task.
Jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in difficult and remote areas.
They have to live amongst many different people.
They need to know and adapt to various situations and different cultures.
They have to mould themselves according to the local needs and environment.
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one among those Indian Peacekeepers who carved a special niche for themselves in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed the Force Commander for an operation in Namibia and he gave his services to ensure the Independence of that country.
General Thimaiyya, who had been Indias army chief, lead the UN Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace efforts.
India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and harmony to the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has given great souls who selflessly served humanity.
Sister Nivedita, whom we also know as Bhagini Nivedita, was one such extraordinary person.
She was born in Ireland as Margret Elizabeth Noble but Swami Vivekanand gave her the name NIVEDITA.
And Nivedita means the one who is fully dedicated.
She later proved herself true to her name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
She was so impressed by Swami Vivekanand that she renounced her happy- prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the British rule.
The Britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally as well.
Constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel inferior were on.
Bhagini Nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of Indian culture.
She brought the people together by infusing a sense of national-awakening.
She travelled to various countries and raised her voice against the mischievous propaganda against Sanatan Dharma and ideology.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanya Bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem Pudhumai Penn or New woman and is renowned for his efforts for Women empowerment.
It is said that Bhagini Nivedita was the inspiration.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
She helped publication of Basus research and publicity through her articles and conferences.
This is Indias unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are a powerful testimony to this.
In 1899, plague broke out in Calcutta and hundreds of people lost their lives in no time.
Sister Nivedita, without caring for her health, started cleaning drains and roads.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, many felicitations to all the children on the occasion of Children's Day celebrated on the birthday of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the emerging heroes in the creation of new India.
Your concern is correct that the diseases which surfaced in old age, or emerged around the last lap of life - have started to appear in children nowadays.
It is indeed surprising today, when we hear that children are suffering from diabetes.
In earlier times, such diseases were known as 'Raj-Rog' which means diseases that used to afflict only the rich or those who lived a life of luxury.
Such diseases were very rare in young people.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in our eating habits.
Society and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis.
If youll start paying attention to it, you will see that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
You just need to make small regular changes in order to transform your habits, making them a part of your way of life.
I would like the family to consciously try to inculcate in children the habit of playing in open grounds.
If possible, we can make the elder family members accompany these children to the playground and play with them.
The children can be made to take the stairs instead of taking the lift.
After dinner, the entire family can go for a walk with the children.
It is simple because it can be easily learned and it is accessible, since it can be done anywhere.
No special tools or fields are needed.
There are several studies being conducted on how Yoga is effective in curbing diabetes.
Do not look at Ayurveda and Yoga as a means of medical treatment only
instead of this we should make them a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, we have been getting glad tidings from the field of sports.
In different games, our athletes have made the country proud.
In hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey title through its dazzling performance.
Our players performed magnificently and on the basis of their sterling efforts, India has become the Asia Cup champion after an interval of ten years.
India had earlier won the Asia Cup in Hockey in the years 2003 and 2007.
I extend felicitations on behalf of the entire nation to the entire team and support staff.
After hockey, good news for India also came in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth has filled every Indians heart with pride by clinching the Denmark Open title with his excellent performance.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this win has completed the triad of the super series premiere title.
I congratulate our young friend, Kidambi Srikanth for this feat and enhancing the prestige of India.
Friends, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them exhibited their skills on the football field.
I also got an opportunity to go and watch a match.
I extend my congratulations and good wishes to all the players, their colleagues, and all the sports lovers once again.
My dear countrymen, a multitude of people write to me about Swachch Bharat, I feel that if I have to do justice to their feelings then I will have to do the program Mann Ki Baat every day and every day Mann Ki Baat will be dedicated solely to the subject of cleanliness.
Some listeners send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others mention the role of youth in these efforts.
Sometimes there is a story of an innovation to bring about cleanliness or winds of change that get ushered due to an officials zeal.
A few days ago I received a very detailed report highlighting the story of transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
An NGO called Ecological Protection Organization launched a cleanliness campaign in Chandrapur Fort.
In this campaign lasting for two hundred days, people performed the task of cleaning the fort, non-stop, without any fatigue and with team-work.
Just think Two-hundred-days of continuous labour
They sent me photographs with a caption- Before and After
This mammoth effort of bringing about cleanliness is a wonderful example of fostering aesthetics, co-operation and continuum.
Forts are symbols of our heritage.
And it is the duty of all countrymen to keep our historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate Ecological Protection Organization, their entire team and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, well celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only the first guru of Sikhs
He envisioned the welfare of all humanity and considered all castes to be equal.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
Guru Nanak Dev ji undertook a 28 thousand kilometre journey on foot and throughout the journey spread the message of true humanity.
He entered into a dialogue with people and showed them the path of truth, sacrifice dedication.
He advocated the message of equality in society, not through mere words but through concrete endeavour.
In order to convey his ideals, Guru Nanak Dev ji composed the Gurbani.
Come 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th PRAKASH VARSH of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Come, let us try advance on the path of his ideals teachings.
My dear countrymen, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, two days from now, on the 31st of October.
All of us know that he was the one who laid the foundation stone of modern, unified India.
We can learn a lot from the unparalleled saga of this great son of Mother India.
The 31st of October was also the day on which Smt. Indira Gandhi left this world.
Translating a thought into reality was his forte.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took on the reins of weaving a unified India.
He ensured that millions of Indians were brought under the ambit of one nation one constitution.
His decision making ability infused in him the strength to overcome all obstacles.
Wherever respectful coercion was needed, he proceeded gently.
Wherever the use of force was imperative, he did not hesitate.
He set a definite goal and moved forward on its path with grit determination.
It was only he who could achieve this task of uniting India.
He conceived a nation where everyone was equal.
One ideal of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will always be inspiring to all of us.
These lofty ideals of Sardar Sahab are relevant to and inspiring for our vision for a New India, even today.
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution in giving a unified texture to the nation is without parallel.
My dear countrymen, you mustve returned to your respective routines after the Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new determination.
May all your dreams come true, my best wishes to you.
It is now a full three years since I started speaking to you over Mann Ki Baat.
This is the 36th episode today.
And I have never said that these are the expressions of my mind
And when I say things in Mann Ki Baat, people from across the country send their ideas, experiences and feelings to me.
Most of these are inspiring to me.
A large number of these ideas are regarding improvements in the functioning of our government.
There are personal grievances and complaints and sometimes attention is drawn to community problems.
I just take half an hour of your time in a month but people keep sending suggestions, ideas and other material over Mann Ki Baat during all 30 days of the month.
And, this is why the three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is in fact a journey of our countrymen, their emotions and their feelings.
I am thankful to our countrymen for having provided me an opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man.
I surely believe and feel that now after three years, social scientists, universities, research scholars, media experts would undertake its analysis and highlight its every aspect, positive as well as negative.
And I am sure that this brainstorming could be useful for Mann Ki Baat in future and will infuse a new energy into it.
But, later, I received letters from all corners of the country. Many social organizations and many youth are already observing this in practice.
I come to know about a lot many people who were involved in ensuring that leftover food was best utilized. I derived much satisfaction and joy to learn this.
Once, I saw a selfie of a sarpanch with a daughter and referred to the same in Mann Ki Baat.
In no time, Selfie with Daughter became a big campaign not only in India but across the whole world.
This is not only an issue of social media.
It became an incident to create a new self-confidence and a feeling of self pride in every daughter.
Every parent started feeling that they should take a selfie with their daughter.
Every daughter started regaining her own self confidence self esteem.
I was in a meeting with the Tourism Department recently.
I asked people who were planning to go travelling that where-ever they visit Incredible India, they must send photographs of those places.
Lakhs of photographs from every corner of India were received which actually became a treasure for those working in the tourism sector.
Ive experienced through Mann Ki Baat that even a tiny incident can launch a massive campaign.
Today I felt like sharing it, since I thought that it has been three years, and events incidents over those three years ran across my mind.
The nation is always ready to move in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the benefit of others, for social good, for the countrys progress.
This is what I gathered, learnt and understood from our countrymen during three years of the Mann Ki Baat campaign.
This is the most valuable capital and enormous strength for any country.
I heartily bow to my countrymen.
In one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had discussed about Khadi and Khadi is not a fabric but an idea, a principle.
Discount is offered on Khadi from 2nd October and people get quite a good rebate.
I once again urge that we should try and take forward the Khadi movement.
The increasing interest in Khadi has infused a new thinking in those working in the Khadi sector as well as those connected, in any way, with Khadi.
How do we bring in new technology, how do we increase productivity, how do we introduce looms driven by solar power How do we rejuvenate our traditional heritage which was lying inactive for 20, 25 or 30 years
New employment opportunities were created for a number of people.
Khadi Gramodyog revived its training centre at Pampore in Kashmir and in this sector Kashmir has so much to offer.
With the reopening of this training centre, the new generation will get a boost in jobs in manufacturing , in weaving, in creating new things and it feels so good to see that even big corporate Houses have started including Khadi items as Diwali gifts.
Even people have started exchanging Khadi items as gifts.
We now experience how something grows naturally.
My dear countrymen, we had taken a resolve in last months Mann Ki Baat and had decided to observe a 15-day Cleanliness Festival before Gandhi Jayanti. We shall connect people through cleanliness.
Our Honourable President inaugurated this programme and the country got connected.
The old or the young, men or women, city or village everyone has become a part of this Cleanliness campaign now.
And when I say Sankalp Se Siddhi, we can see for ourselves as to how a Cleanliness Campagin is advancing towards Sankalp Siddhi, that is Attainment through Reslove.
Everyone accepts this, co-operates in this and makes a contribution in realizing this.
I am grateful to our Honourable President.
But, every section of society has taken this as its own campaign, everyone has got connected to this.
Whether it be people from the sports world, academicians, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, government employees, police, or army jawans every one has got connected with this.
A kind of a pressure has been created in public places and now people resist if someone tries to spoil or to make a public place dirty in any way and even those spoiling public places are also feeling this pressure.
It is a good thing and I am pleased to know that just in the first four days of Swachhata Hi Sewa Abhiyan more than 75 lakh people joined these activities with more than 40 thousand initiatives.
I have seen that some people are continuously working and are determined to bring out results.
I noticed something else this time one is that we clean up a place, and the second is that we become aware and do not spread filth
but if we have to inculcate cleanliness as a habit, we must start an idea- based movement also.
This time a number of competitions were organized on the theme Cleanliness is Service.
More than two and a half crore children took part in an Essay Competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children made paintings.
They drew pictures based on their own imaginations.
Whenever there is a reference to cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to media persons.
We can see in Swachhata Hi Sewa movement as to how the electronic media and the print media in our country can render a big service to the country.
Just a few days ago some one drew my attention towards Bilal Dar, a young man of 18 years from Srinagar.
And you will be glad to know that Srinagar Municipal Corporation has made him their brand ambassador and when there is a talk of brand ambassador, there is a general feeling that heshe must be a Cine artist or a sports-personality.
But not in this case.
Bilal Dar got connected to the Swachhata Abhiyan or Cleanliness Campaign since the age of 12-13 years and has been working for the last 5 to 6 years.
Bilal is very young age wise but is a source of inspiration for all of us who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we will have to accept the fact that history begets history and when there is a reference to history, it is but natural to recall our great men.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji.
And, what was the main focus of all these great men
One thing was common and that was to live for the country, do something for the nation
Nanaji Deshmukh left politics and joined the Gramodaya Movement and while celebrating his Centenary year, it is but natural to honour his contribution towards Gramodaya.
Indias former President Shriman Abdul Kalamji used to speak of Nanajis contribution in rural development while talking to the youth.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyayji also talked about the last person at the farthest fringes.
We also have to run for unity in order to promote the mantra of unity.
The element of Unity in diversity being Indias speciality comes naturally to us.
We feel proud of diversity but have you ever tried to feel this diversity
There are vacations, Diwali is drawing near, all around in our country, there is an inclination to travel to some place or the other
people go as tourists and it is very natural.
But, it is a matter of concern when we do not see our own country, we do not know about its diversities nor do we understand them.
Our country is full of such myriad diversities.
All these great men travelled widely in India.
At the beginning of their endeavour, they tried to know and understand India
tried to live India within themselves.
This is my personal experience, I had a chance of visiting more than five hundred districts of India.
In more than four hundred fifty districts, I had a night stay too.
I request you too, to feel the Unity in Diversity which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy.
The dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is inherent in this.
This is the power of our tourism.
I would request that during these vacations do not go out just for a change but leave with the intention to know, understand gain something. Internalize India within yourselves.
Internalize the diversities of millions of denizens of India within you.
These experiences will enrich your lives.
Your vision will expand.
And, who can be a better teacher than experience
Generally, October to March is the suitable time for tourism.
You must send photographs on incredibleindia.
If you happen to meet people there, send their photos too.
Write not only about architecture or natural beauty but write something about their daily life too.
Can you post on incredibleindia
You see, if all the people of one state will do this, then I will ask the government to do a scrutiny of it and prepare publicity material based on seven common things received from each state.
The Government of India will work on that.
The government will accept suggestions about making films, videos or preparing publicity material and about promoting that destination.
Come, get connected with me.
You can also act as a major catalyst in promoting the tourism of our country by utilizing the time from this October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, being a human being, there are many things that touch me too.
They agitate my heart.
They leave a deep impression on my heart.
After all I am also a human being just like you.
Their husbands laid down their lives in the service of mother India.
One can imagine ones agonizing mental state if her world gets shattered at such a early age
She received training for 11 months putting in great efforts and she put her life at stake to fulfill her husbands dreams.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubeys husband Mukesh Dubey was a Naik in the army and attained martyrdom while fighting for his country.
His wife Nidhi also took a resolve and joined the army.
It is very natural for every countryman to have a deep sense of respect for these two bravehearts, our Matri Shakti.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to both of them.
They have evoked a new inspiration and a new awakening among millions of our countrymen.
Many congratulation to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a big opportunity for our younger generation between Navratra festivities and Diwali.
FIFA under- 17 world cup is being organized in our country.
I am sure reverberations of the spirit of football will be heard all around.
It will evince more interest in Football in every generation.
There should not be a single school-college ground in India where we will not see our youngsters at play.
My dear countrymen, Navratras are going on.
It is a time for praying to Ma Durga.
The whole environment is filled with sacred fragrance.
All around there is an atmosphere of spirituality, an air of festivities, an atmosphere of bhakti, of reverence.
This is revered as a festival of Shakti Sadhana.
This is also known as Sharadiya Navratri, the beginning of autumn.
My dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar.
When on the one hand, a sense of festivity pervades the land, and on the other, news of violence comes in, from one part of the country, it is only natural of be concerned.
Ours is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the land of Sardar Patel who gave up his all for the unity of the nation.
We have been hearing and saying Ahimsa ParmoDharmah from our childhood.
In my address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had said that violence in the name of faith will not be tolerated, whether it is communal belief systems, whether it is subscribing to political ideologies, whether it is allegiance to a person or customs and traditions.
In the Constitution given to us by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar there is every provision for ensuring justice for each and every person.
I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression whether it is a person or a group neither this country nor any government will tolerate it.
Even our festivals are replete with diversity.
Ours is arich cultural heritage, spanning thousands of years when we look at our cultural traditions, social customs, historical events, there would hardly be a day left in the year which is not connected with a festival.
You would have noticed, that all our festivals follow the almanac of nature.
There is a direct connect with nature.
The Jain community celebrated the SamvatsariParva yesterday.
In the month of Bhadra, ParyushanParva is celebrated by the Jain Community.
The last day of ParyushanParva is observed as Samvatsari.
This is indeed a remarkable tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country.
When we speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about SarvajanikGaneshotsav, that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival.
This tradition was established by Bal Gangadhar Tilak 125 years ago, and it was 125 years ago thatSarvajanikGaneshotsav became a symbol of Indias struggle for freedom.
And after Independence, this festival has become a vehicle of raising social and educational awareness.
Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival.
This Mahaparva, mega-festival stands for unity, equality, integrity and honesty.
My heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela.
Of the numerous colourful festivals of India, Onam is a prime festival of Kerela.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
This festival showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
It gives the message of love and harmony - awakens new hopes and aspirations, and gives new confidence to the people.
Our festivals are now becoming great attractions for tourism.
And I would like to mention to my countrymen, that festivals like Navaratri in Gujarat, or Durga Utsav in Bengal are tremendous tourist attractions.
Other festivals of our country too, provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors.
We should think about what more can be done in this direction.
In this series of festivals, Eid-ul-uha will be celebrated in a few days from now.
Heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are of course symbols of faith and belief
in the New India, we should transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well.
This is nothing new for us, but it is important to convert it into a social character.
Public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but in our villages, towns, cities, states and in our entire country Cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals.
My dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing.
These days, a new measure to gauge a new dimension, a new parameter, has come in to being. It determines what your upbringing has been, how modern you are, how modern your thinking is.
And as a result of this I find that, the ecofriendly Ganpati, in this Ganesh Festival has turned into a huge campaign.
If you go on YouTube, you will see that children in every home are making earthen Ganesh idols and are colouring them.
Some are using vegetable colours, while some are pasting bits and pieces of paper.
Media houses too, are making a great effort in training people, inspiring them and guiding them towards ecofriendly Ganesh idols.
What a massive transformation this has been
a pleasant one at that.
And as I mentioned, our country is blessed with millions and millions of the brightest of brains.
And it is nice to see all sorts of new innovations.
Someone told me about a gentleman who is an engineer and who has collected and combined special varieties of clay, to give training in making Ganesh idols.
The Ganesh Visarjan or immersion is done in a small bucket of water, where the idol dissolves within no time.
The campaign for Cleanliness which was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on the 2nd of October.
And the positive results are now being seen.
Toilets have increased from 39 to almost 67 of the population
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have declared themselves open defecation free.
Gujarat saw devastating floods recently.
Many people lost their lives.
When the waters receded, there was so much filth everywhere.
That is when, in Dhanera in the Banaskantha District of Gujarat, volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind cleaned twenty-two affected temples and two mosques in a phased manner.
They came together and toiled collectively.
If this committed effort towards cleanliness become inherent to us, our country will certainly take our nation to greater heights.
We could look at this as preparations for Diwali, preparations for Navaratri, preparations for Durga Puja.
Go to settlements in your neighborhood, go to nearby villages, but do this in the form of a movement.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has created a section on MyGov.
My friends from the social media can run a few creative campaigns and thus become a source of inspiration in the virtual world, to see results in the real world.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has organized, the Swachch Sankalp se Swachcha Siddhi Pratiyogita, From the resolve of Cleanliness to attaining Cleanliness Competition comprising an essay competition, a short film making competition and a painting competition.
You can write essays in various languages and there is no age limit.
You can make a short film even with your mobile phone.
You can film a two-three-minute movie that inspires cleanliness.
The best three participants three at the district level, three at the state level will be given prizes.
And to this end beginning 15th September let us take the mantra, the message, Swachchata Hi Seva, Cleanliness is Service to each and every home.
Take one or another step towards cleanliness.
You can imagine the inner bliss of paying homage to our revered Bapu, with fifteen days of this cleanliness campaign, Swachchata Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October.
My dear countrymen, I want to specially express my indebtedness to you.
I want to thank you from the core of my heart, not because you have been connected with Mann Ki Baat, for such a long time I want to express my gratitude and indebtedness as millions of people from across the country come together with Mann kiBaat.
The number of listeners are in crores out of which lakhs of people write letters to me, send messages, and get their messages recorded on phone, which is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to understand the hearts and minds of one and all.
Much as you wait for Mann ki Baat, I await your messages with greater eagerness.
All sorts of things come to me.
Sometimes certain things become a part of our habits, that we dont even realize that we are doing something wrong.
Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about a friend of mine.
She always tries to help others, but one habit of hers amazes me.
I went for shopping with her at a mall.
She coolly spent two thousand rupees on a sari, and four hundred and fifty rupees on a pizza.
Whereas, she haggled for a long time, over merely five rupees, with the auto driver, who took us to the mall.
On the way back, we stopped to buy vegetables, and again she haggled with the vendors to save 4-5 rupees.
I feel very bad.
Not just this, when we go to a showroom to buy a saree, we dont bargain, but when it comes to someone poor, we just cannot resist bargaining.
Have you ever wondered what a poor man goes through
Two or five rupees make no difference to your life, but have you thought how much heartache this petty habit of yours can cause him.
Madam I am grateful to you for calling me with this touching message.
I am certain that my countrymen, if they are in the habit of behaving in this way with the poor will now stop doing so.
My dear young friends, the country celebrates National Sports Day on the 29th of August.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player, hockey wizard, Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to hockey was unparalleled.
I am reminding you of this because I want the younger generation of our country to take part in sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are a young nation, our youth should get manifested in the field sports as well.
Sports, in a way, is a recipe that brings people together.
The young generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports and in todays computer era I would like to alert you to the fact that the playing field is far more important than the play station.
Play FIFA on the computer, but sometimes show your skills with the football out in the field.
You must be playing cricket on the computer but the pleasure of actually playing cricket in an open field under the sky is something else.
There was a time when the children in the family went out to play, the mother would first ask, When will you come back home
Now the times are such that children, when they come home, they either start watching cartoons in a corner, or are glued to mobile games.
Young friends, the Sports Ministry is launching a Sports Talent Search Portal to search for sporting talent and to groom them.
Any talented child who has an achievement in sports, can upload his biodata or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will impart training to selected emerging players.
The Ministry is launching the portal tomorrow.
The good news for our young friends is that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is being organized in India, from the 6th to the 28th of October.
These six young women will embark on a voyage across the seas, in a small boat, INS Tarini.
The expedition has been named, NavikaSagar Parikrama.
They will circumnavigate the globe and return home, after many months.
Our six daughters riding the waves of the high seas, with courage, is the first instance of its kind in the world.
Each and every Indian would be proud of these daughters.
I salute their valour and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I too am making a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModiApp to ensure that you can read it.
For this is a tale of heroism, a tale of personal experiences, and I would be happy to bring you the stories of these daughters.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th September as Teachers Day.
He was committed to being a teacher. He was a scholar, a diplomat, the President of India and yet, quintessentially a teacher.
The most important quality of a teacher, is to awaken in his students, a sense of creativity and the joy of learning.
Get someone committed to a five-year resolve.
Show him the path of attainment, which he can achieve in five years - so that he can experience the joy of success in life.
Such an atmosphere can be created by our schools, our colleges, our teachers, our educational institutions.
When we speak about transformation in our country, we must think of our teachers as we do of our mothers.
The teacher plays a vital role in transformation.
In the life of every teacher, there are incidents of simple efforts that succeeded in bringing about a transformation in somebodys life.
We will play a big role in the transformation of the nation, if we make a collective effort.
Come, lets move forward with the mantra, Teach to Transform.
Pranam Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Dr.
Ananya Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I have been specially interested in Financial Inclusion.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, financial inclusion, had been a point of discussion amongst Financial Pundits, not just in India, but all over the world.
On the 28th of August 2014, we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts.
Tomorrow on the 28th of August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna will complete three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme, bank accounts have been opened.
This number is larger than the population of many countries of the world.
His ways have changed, he has now started going to the bank.
There is now an air of prudence. He is now beginning to understand that the money can be of use for his children.
The money can be used productively in the days to come.
Not just this, when a poor person sees a RuPay Card, in his pocket, he finds himself to be equal to the privileged that if they have a credit card in their pockets, I too have a RuPay Card in mind.
He feels a sense of dignity.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, almost 65 thousand crore rupees have deposited in banks by our underprivileged brethren.
In a way, this is a saving for the poor, this is his empowerment for the future.
And those who opened their accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, have received the benefit of insurance as well.
For many families, in times of adversity, or on the demise of the head of the family, through the one-rupeeinsurance,they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days.
Banks have conducted surveys about how the common man has benefitted from Jan DhanYojna, from Insurance Schemes, from RuPay Card and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna.
I will try my best to bring these to you
and the media can also take advantage of these inspiring stories.
They too, can interview such people, and inspire the young generation.
My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you michchamidukkadm.
We human beings have a natural inclination to be enchanted by the delights of the rainy season.
Animals, birds, flora nature in its entirety, is filled with the joys of the season.
Climate change, altered weather cycles, and transformations in the environment, are also having a big negative impact.
Recently, in certain parts of India, particularly, Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some areas of Bengal, have had to bear the brunt of natural disasters, caused by excessive rains.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are also personally visiting affected areas.
The state governments too are making maximum possible efforts on their part to provide relief to the flood affected people.
Social organisations, cultural organizations and common citizens charged with the spirit of service are also making their utmost efforts to help the affected people in this situation.
The Government of India, Army personnel, Air Force personnel, NDRF personnel, Paramilitary forces everybody does his or her best in providing succour to the disaster stricken people.
Life goes completely topsy-turvy as a result of the floods.
Crops, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electricity, communication links everything gets affected.
Therefore, we have formulated a scheme for the insurance companies, especially crop insurance companies, to make them more proactive, to ensure quick settlements of claims for farmers.
A 247 control room helpline number 1078 is functioning continuously to deal with the flood situation.
People are also voicing their difficulties.
We should also gradually make it our nature to set our work patterns according to the weather predictions, which could safeguard us against losses.
Whenever I prepare myself for Mann Ki Baat, I find that the citizens of our country prepare themselves even more.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountants Day and was deeply impressed.
In the same manner, Goods and Services Tax, GST, was launched on this very day last month.
Could you please elaborate whether its results after one month are matching the expectations of the Government
I would like to hear your views on this.
I feel very happy and satisfied when a poor person writes to say how because of GST prices of various items essential for him have come down, and commodities have become cheaper.
And most important of all, the trust of customers for the traders is increasing.
I have been observing how GST has impacted the transport and logistics sector
The speed at which the smooth transition has taken place, along with rapid migration and new registrations, has instilled a new sense of confidence in the entire country.
And some day, the Pundits of Economics, Pundits of Management and Pundits of Technology, will certainly undertake researches and write about Indias GST experiment as a model for the world.
It will become a case study for universities across the world.
The implementation and furtherance of such a phenomenal change on such a monumental scale, with the involvement of so many tens of millions of people in such a vast country, is in itself a pinnacle of success.
The world will definitely make a study of it.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the states and the Centre together.
And as a result, one overriding priority for every government has been to ensure that there is no burden on the plate of the poor on account of GST.
And using the GST App all information is available on your mobile phone as to how much the price of an item was earlier and how much will it be now in the new situation.
The manner in which the friendly environment was created between the Government and traders, between the government and consumers, played a very significant role in enhancing mutual trust.
I extend my heartiest felicitations to each and every ministry, every department and all employees of the Central and State governments involved with this process.
GST is a fine example of the collective strength of the people of India.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reformation.
I would like to once again express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat with such felicity.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of Revolution.
We have been hearing this as a natural fact right from our childhood and the reason is, the Non-Cooperation Movement was launched on the 1st of August 1920
the uit India Movement, which is also known as Agast Kranti began on the 9th of August 1942
and on 15thAugust 1947 India became independent.
In a way, there are many events in the month of August that are closely associated with the history of our freedom movement.
Our young generation must know what had happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of India, with their ardent desire for freedom, came together, fought together, and suffered hardships these pages of history are an inspiration to us for building a glorious India.
Millions of Indians responded to Mahatma Gandhis clarion call and the mantra of Do or Die
Millions of the youth of the country renounced their studies, gave up their books.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narain played a leading and pivotal role.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942, two different personas of Mahatma Gandhi can be seen.
The whole scenario of the uit India Movement was different and in 1942 things rose to such a point, there was such a heightened sense of intensity, that a Mahapurush like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or Die.
And I sometimes think that if we link the pages of history, it is seen that the First War of Independence took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle which began in 1857, continued to be manifested in one or the other corner of the country till 1942.
This long time period ignited the intense longing for freedom in the hearts of the people.
Each one became committed to do something.
This perseverance, this struggle from 1857 to 1942 created a situation which reached its climax in 1942
the clarion call of uit India was such that within five years, in 1947 the British were compelled to leave India.
1857 to 1942 the yearning for freedom had reached the grassroots, had reached everybody.
And 1942 to 1947 these decisive five years became integral for the masses to successfully attain through resolve, freedom for the country.
These five years were indeed decisive.
I would now like to connect you with its mathematical manifestation.
We became free in 1947.
This is 2017.
It has been almost 70 years.
Governments have come and gone.
Systems have been made, changed, nurtured, and expanded.
Everyone has tried to rid the country of its problems in ones own way.
I can see that 2017 to 2022 presents itself as a new time segment of five years for attainment through resolve.
let there be millions and millions of resolves
let there be strivings for the realisation of these millions and millions of resolves.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were decisive for the countrys Independence, these five years from 2017 to 2022 can and must play a decisive role for the future of India.
Five years from now, we will celebrate 75 years of Indias Independence.
Therefore, we must take a firm resolve today.
We must make 2017 our Year of Resolve.
Every Indian, social organisations, Local Self-Government Institutions, schools, colleges, various organizations all should take one resolve or the other for a New India.
Let us come together and make this a Festival of Resolve.
I would particularly like to call upon the online world, since wherever we may be, we are almost always online so I would like to invite the online community and specially my young friends to come forward and contribute innovatively for building of the New India.
They can use technology videos, posts, blogs, scripts, novel ideas to put forward all these.
Transform this campaign into a peoples movement.
A uit India uiz is also being launched for my young friends on NarendraModiApp.
This quiz is an attempt to familiarise the youth with Indias glorious history and the heroes of the freedom movement.
It is my belief that you will surely publicise and spread awareness about this quiz.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, as the nations Pradhan Sewak, I get an opportunity to communicate with the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
25 billion of my countrymen that resounds from the Red Fort.
I try to give words to their dreams, and I am glad that for the past 3 years, I get suggestions from every corner of the country for August 15, as to what I should speak on the 15th August and which issues should I include in my address on the occasion.
This time too, I invite you to share your thoughts either on MyGov or on NarendraModiApp.
For the previous three 15th August speeches, one consistent complaint has been that my speeches tend to be a little lengthy.
I have planned to keep my speech short this time not more than 40-45-50 minutes.
My countrymen, I would like to say one more thing to you.
Indias economy has in itself an element of social economics.
And we should never underestimate its value.
Our festivals, our celebrations are not merely occasions of joy and merriment.
Our festivals are in themselves campaigns of social reform too.
And each of our festivals are directly linked with the financial conditions of the poorest of the poor.
Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Utsav, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Pooja, Diwali these will be observed one after the other.
As far as the economy is concerned, hundreds of families start making Rakhis in small household units, many months before the festival of Rakhi.
Rakhi makers and their sellers, sweets shops vendors the professions of hundreds, thousands flourish on the occasion of a festival.
The households of our poor brethren and their families are dependent in a way on these activities.
When we light a diya, an earthen lamp on Deepawali, it is not merely a festival of lights, a festival that illuminates the entire house
it is directly connected with those poor families who make small diyas or earthen lamps.
Today as I speak about festivals and how they are linked to the economy of the poor, I want to touch upon the subject of environment as well.
I have observed and sometimes think that the citizens of our country are more aware and active than me.
For the last one month, environmentally conscious citizens have constantly written letters to me.
125 years and 1. 25 billion countrymen
How we must lend strength to that spirit and at the same time resolve to use eco-friendly clay Ganesha idols, to protect the environment.
This should be the endeavor of all of us. I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen for the various upcoming festivals and celebrations.
My dear countrymen, we are continually seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to the country in all the fields be it education, economic activities, social spheres or in sports they are scaling new heights.
We as a nation take great pride in our daughters.
Recently our daughters performed brilliantly in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
This week I had the opportunity to meet our daughters, the members of our Womens Cricket team.
I felt happy talking to them, but I had a feeling that they felt burdened by the fact that they could not win the World Cup.
This stress, this tension was evident on their faces also.
We have seen during many such events where if the Indian players fail, the anger of the country is vented towards the players.
You may not have won the final match but you have won the hearts of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Truly our young generation, especially the daughters of our country are doing so much to bring glory to the nation.
I once again extend my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to the young generation of our country, especially our daughters.
And I am reminding you once again of 2022, 75 years of Indias Independence.
Every countryman should make a resolve, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to realise that resolve.
The destiny, the future of the country shall be brighter, let us move ahead with this belief.
Lots and lots of good wishes to you all. Thank you
One has seen that no matter how hectic the life is, no matter how tense we are, whether its ones personal or public life, the arrival of the rains does lift ones spirits.
The Car festival of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra, is being celebrated in several parts of the country with great piety and fervour.
This festival is now also celebrated in some parts of the world.
The underprivileged of the country are deeply connected to Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
On the occasion of Lord Jagannaths Car Festival, I extend my heartiest greetings to all my fellow countrymen, and offer my obeisance to Lord Jagannath.
Indias diversity is its unique characteristic, and Indias diversity is also its strength.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brethren reside in that little village and in a way, form a majority of its population.
During this Ramzan the villagers decided to get together and construct toilets.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF, this week.
Only then will the habit of the body and mind will change.
Cleanliness is also similar to this.
To free ourselves of these habits we will have to constantly strive and persevere.
This happened in the Vizianagaram District of Andhra Pradesh.
And what was the objective To construct 10,000 household toilets in 71 gram panchayats in those hundred hours.
And my Dear Countrymen, you will be happy to learn that the administration and the people together did construct 10,000 toilets in hundred hours successfully.
71 villages became ODF.
I congratulate the people in the government, government officials and the citizens of Vizianagaram district on this great accomplishment of achieving this feat through immense hard work and setting a very inspiring example in the process.
These days, people have been regularly sending their suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, on the NarendraModiApp, on MyGov. in, through letters and Akashvani.
Not only is Democracy a system, but also a sanskar- a part of our ethos.
One needs to be constantly alert about our Democracy, that is why we must also keep remembering the events that inflicted harm upon our democracy
and at the same time move ahead, carrying forward the virtues of democracy.
1975 25th June it was a dark night that no devotee of democracy can ever forget.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail at that time.
The scorching summer month,The sad winter moonlight,The sobbing monsoon,An emptiness pervading withinAn entire year has gone by. The world confined behind bars,But the soul like a restless birdThe freedom song resonatesFrom the earth to the sky,An entire year has gone by.
The eyes are in anticipationCounting days and momentsThe beloved who went away,Shall return one day,An entire year has gone by.
From the seashores to the mountains, people welcomed the first rays of the sun, with Yoga.
Which Indian wouldnt be proud of this
Almost all the countries in the world made Yoga Day their own.
In China, Yoga was practiced on the Great Wall of China, and on the World Heritage site of Machu Picchu in Peru, at 2400 metres above sea level.
In France, yoga was performed in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower.
In Abu Dhabi in UAE, more than 4000 persons participated in mass yoga.
The staff of the UN and diplomats from across the world participated.
Yoga has created a world record again this time also.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, around 55 thousand people performed Yoga together and created a new world record.
I too had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga event held in Lucknow.
But I also had the good fortune to practice Yoga in the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers practiced yoga in Siachen where temperatures reach minus 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Some TV channels also took this idea forward.
Sound bite.
Respected Prime Minister Sir, I am Dr. Anil Sonara speaking from Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Sir, I have a question.
Is there nothing we can do to have this implemented throughout the country, Sir
Thus I was also reminded of what had slipped my mind.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had set this tradition of welcoming, by not giving bouquets, but books or handkerchiefs instead.
I have already begun to issue instructions in the government.
Here too we can gradually nurture this habit.
And the life span of a bouquet is very short.
You receive it in your hand for a moment and then abandon it.
I say this, thinking of the historical value of such gifts.
During my past UK visit, in London, the ueen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth had invited me to dine with her.
Afterwards when she showed me a small thread-spun khadi handkerchief, her eyes lit up.
With great respect and in an emotion filled voice, she said, that Mahatma Gandhi had sent this handkerchief to her as a wedding gift.
So many years have passed and yet, ueen Elizabeth has treasured the handkerchief gifted by Mahatma Gandhi.
A small gift by Mahatma Gandhi, has become a part of her life and a part of history.
I know that these habits do not change overnight, and when we talk about it, we invite criticism.
The entire process becomes transparent.
So, when people register in E-GEM, all the government departments become aware of them.
As there are no middlemen, the goods are available at very reasonable rates.
And besides India, these satellites are of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America, nearly 14 such countries.
And with Indias Nano Satellite Mission, we will get a lot of help in the field of agriculture, farming, and dealing with natural disasters.
We are all aware that a few days ago, ISRO has successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And of all the satellites launched by India, this was the heaviest satellite.
On the 19th of June, our Mars Mission completed one thousand days.
You may be aware that when we had successfully created a place for the Mars Mission in orbit, this entire mission was planned for a duration of 6 months.
It had a life expectancy of 6 months.
The completion of one thousand days, is an important milestone in our scientific journey, our space odyssey.
It is becoming evident that along with studies, our new generations can see a future in sports as well.
And our sportspersons, through their prowess, skills and accomplishments win laurels for the country as well.
Recently Indias Badminton player, Kidambi Shrikant has brought glory to the nation by winning Indonesia Open.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to him and his coach for this victory.
Sports play an important role in personality development also.
There is a great significance of sports in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in our country.
If the children in our family are interested in sports, they should be given opportunities.
They should not be forced off the playing fields to be locked in rooms with books.
They should study as well, if they can do well in studies, they should certainly do so, but if they have the potential and the inclination to do well in sports, that should be encouraged and supported by the school, college, family and all the people around them.
Each one should nurture dreams for the next Olympics.
But, we are now awaiting the rains.
As I am talking to you today , the holy month of Ramzan has already commenced .
I convey my hearty greetings to all fellow Indians and everyone across the world, especially the Muslim brethren at the advent of this auspicious month of Ramazan.
Prayer, spirituality and charity are accorded the highest priority during Ramzan.
We, Indians, are very lucky that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India and its 1.
25 billion people can take pride in the fact that people from all communities and faith are available here.
This is a country where both theists and atheists
idolaters and those loathing idol-worship co-exist.
We have adapted ourselves to myriad kinds of ideologies, different ways of worshipping and all types of traditions and imbibed the art of co-existential living .
In the ultimate , any religion, faith, ideology or tradition- give us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in further strengthening these values of peace, unity and goodwill.
I, once again convey my best wishes to all.
I am glad that many people have given me feedback.
All of them showed enthusiasm by personally speaking out their minds to me.
I could not read them all nor could listen to all the messages because there were such a large number of messages.
But whatever I could see from a cursory look that while some made efforts to learn music, some tried hands on a new musical instrument, some of them are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are trying to learn a new language.
Some are learning cooking, some others are learning dance and drama Some have written that they have now started to write poems.
They are making efforts to know about nature and are learning the art of living and trying to understand the world.
I am extremely happy and want to share one of the phone-calls with you.
I am Diksha Katiyal speaking.
I had almost left the habit of reading.
Therefore I decided to pick up the habit during vacations.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle , it was then I realized that how much struggle was involved in getting India freed, how much sacrifices were given and how so many freedom fighters spent years in prison.
I am particularly inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved so much at such a young age.
Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.
I am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country.
Countless great men spent their youth in jails.
We see all those great men who spent their time in jails did a great job of writing and reading.
Their writings provided a great strength and inspiration to our Freedom Movement.
Many years ago, I visited Andaman Nicobar Islands. I went to see the Cellular Jail there.
He used to write poems on the walls of his prison cell.
He was confined to a very small cell.
These seekers freedom must have gone through immense torture.
I was inspired to visit the Cellular Jail only after reading Savarkarjis book Maazi Janmthep.
A light and sound show is also shown there which is very inspiring.
I would definitely want to tell our younger generation that to even perceive what kind of torture and trouble these freedom fighters had suffered to achieve freedom for us one must visit this Cellular Jail.
Once we go there We come to know as to why this was called Kaalaa Paani or the dark waters If you get a chance, please pay a visit to this place which is actually a pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
In other words, we may say back to basics.
Connecting with nature means nurturing a better planet.
And, who can explain this in a better way than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi often used to say, One must care about a world one will not see.
This means that it is our duty to be concerned about the world which we shall not see and to care for that.
You might have also observed that whenever we feel tired and exhausted, splashing a glass of water on our face has a wonderful rejuvenating effect.
If you return after a tiring days work, just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air this will fill you with fresh energy.
So, the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th June should become our individual campaign as well.
And we are reaping the benefits of the efforts made by our ancestors to save the environment.
In India, it has been said Earth is the mother and I am her son.
If we recall Lord Buddha, a fact comes to light that his birth, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana, all three happened under a tree.
We have many festivals and religious rituals which are based on worshiping nature and affection towards nature is a part of our everyday life.
But we need to present this in modern language and integrate with modern arguments.
These days , I keep receiving news from our states.
Almost in every state, a big plantation campaign gets underway with the onset of monsoon.
Millions of trees are planted.
Yoga is not merely an exercise.
Just two days back, I have written letters to all governments and all leaders of the world about the Yoga Day.
Last year, I made announcements of some Yoga competitions and some awards as well.
We shall gradually advance in that direction.
It is a very interesting suggestion.
Grand parents, parents and children should together perform Yoga and also upload their photos.
It will be such pleasant blend of Yesterday, today and tomorrow that it will lend a new dimension to Yoga.
I express my gratitude for this suggestion and I feel that as our Selfie with Daughter campaign had proved to be a very inspiring experience.
So will this campaign of posting pictures of three generations together performing yoga will evoke curiosity across the nation as well as across the world.
You should certainly send the pictures of three generations doing yoga together to me on Narendra ModiApp or on Mygov.
This, in a way, is a movement on preventive health care.
From then onwards, I get a chance to stay in different parts of the country.
And, I have seen that people closely follow as to what Modi does, where does Modi go, what all has Modi done.
This phone call will also attract your attention.
Modi ji I watch whether on TV or Social Media, wherever you go, one can see people in that city pay special attention to cleanliness.
Mumbai or Surat, your clarion call has led people to adopt cleanliness as a mission.
The cleanliness drive that you had begun from the Ghats or Banks of the Ganges in Kashi has now taken the shape of a movement inspired by you.
You are right, that wherever I go, the government machinery does the cleaning but nowadays cleanliness also turns into a social event.
Five, seven or ten days before my visit a large number of cleanliness drives are held.
You can very well imagine how much pleasure I derive by knowing this fact and also by noticing that the country is also closely monitoring the programme.
I congratulate everyone connected with this Cleanliness programme providing strength to it.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
This is in a way a humorous suggestion.
I do not know whether I would be able to do it or not.
Modi ji, when someone asks for your visit , your stay, you should ask as to what would be the standard of cleanliness, if they wish to invite you.
The idea is very good but I will have to think.
But, one thing is right that this movement should be encouraged and it would definitely be better if cleaning tonnes of waste are cleaned and and given as presents in place of other gifts.
How many people shall we be able to save from ill health.
The Central Government has along with State Governments and with the cooperation of municipal representatives of cities decided to launch a massive and important campaign of waste management.
On the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June, there are going to be litter bins made available to collect solid waste and liquid waste in 4000 towns of the country.
Two types of waste bins will be available, one would be of green colour and the other blue.
This waste can be utilized in fields, and if you will remember that fields are green then you will remember what to place in the green litter bins.
The second type of waste is like old newspapers, cardboard, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, leather, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals and other kind of waste are all dry waste or litter which can be recycled by machines but cannot be directly used and has to be placed in the blue waste bin.
A few days ago, you must have heard that the Versova beach in Mumbai, which was infamous for its filth has now transformed into a a clean and beautiful beach.
People toiled for about 80-90 weeks, unceasingly and turned Versova beach around by extracting thousand of tonnes of waste materials and today Versova beach is clean and beautiful.
This campaign was owned by Versova Residence volunteer or VRV.
A gentleman called Afroz Shah started this mission from October, 2015 whole heartedly with all his might, slowly people started joining his bandwagon and turned into a peoples movement.
My dear countrymen, an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers, social media or TV for the last 15 days.
Three years ago you vested the responsibility of Pradhan Sewak- the Chief Servant of the People upon me.
There have been many surveys and several opinion polls.
I see this entire process as a very healthy sign.
The works done during these years were tested on every touch stone .
It was analyzed by every segment of society.
And this is a great process in democracy.
I thank those people, who provided critical and important feedback.
The mistakes and the shortcomings once highlighted can be rectified.
Whether something is good, little less effective or bad, whatever it is, one has to learn from it and move ahead in life putting the learning from it into practice.
Constructive criticism strengthens democracy
for an aware nation, an awakened nation, this churning is very important.
And there are many families who have written to me these very feelings.
And as I said, as an ordinary citizen, I too get affected emotionally.
Im grateful to the Honble President, Honble Vice President and Madam Speaker that inspite of their such high stature they took out time and they accorded importance to Mann Ki Baat.
In fact it in itself has given a new dimension to Mann Ki Baat.
Some of our friends, while working on this book had discussed it with me also.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, when we shall meet next time by then monsoon rains would be lashing every corner of the country, the weather would have changed, examination results would have arrived, the journey of education will begin anew and the rains would bring a hope, pleasant fragrance, a new aroma
Come let us move ahead while loving nature in such a pleasant atmosphere.
My many felicitations and best wishes to you. Thank you.
My dearest countrymen namaskar.
Maybe the system has also become accustomed in dealing with these problems, and so do have the people become accustomed to them.
I have come across the inquisitiveness of children, the ambitions of the youth, and the gist of the experience of elders
While travelling in the train or the bus if someone coughs, the next person immediately advises a cure.
To offer advice or suggest a solution, are part of our nature.
Most of those who give suggestions or try to reach to me are those who are really doing something in their lives.
They are making efforts and are engrossed as per their intellect, capacity, ability and circumstances so that something good must happen.
Some people also give suggestions thinking that if an idea has the potential to work then more people would listen to it if it is heard on a wider platform and hence many people can benefit.
And not only this, when I mention something positive, such memories come to recall, it is very much a pleasant experience.
And upon my mention, there were mentions of many innovative ideas to save food from being wasted that are being put into practice employed in many corners of the country on NarendraModiApp and also on MyGov.
Many have sent me the videos of their work in this field.
There are many places where Roti Banks are operating.
1st May is the foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, many felicitations to the citizens of these two states on my behalf.
Both states have made constant strides to scale newer heights of development and have contributed toward the advancement of the country.
And both the states had a steady stream of great men whose lives and sterling contributions in every sphere of society is a source of inspiration for us.
In remembrance of these great men, on the foundation day of these two states, we should take the pledge of taking our state, our country, our society, our city, and our family to glorious heights in 2022, when we celebrate 75 years of independence.
Plans should be drawn to achieve that pledge and taken forward with the cooperation of all citizens.
I wish the very best to these two states.
The heat that we used to experience in months of May-June in our country is being felt in March-April this year.
So, when I was taking suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions offered related to what should be done to beat the heat during summer time.
Most of the suggestions or practices to beat summer are not new but are prevalent for a long time, however it is very useful to remember them from time to time.
Theyve mentioned that water should be kept in trays and utensils on the balcony and on the terrace.
I have seen that small children of the family do this very enthusiastically.
Once they understand why they should fill the pots with water they would go and inspect 10 times in a day to ensure there is water in the tray. And also watch if the birds came or not.
We think as if it is a game going on , but in actuality, this is a novel way of instilling empathy in the child's mind.
In our country, we are traditionally imbued with a sense of symbiotic co-existence with animals, birds and nature yet it is necessary that collective efforts in this regard should be emphasized.
When I was Chief Minister of Gujarat, Syedna Sahib the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Community had completed his hundred years.
He lived till 103 years.
As part of the celebration of his 100th year the Bohra community society had launched a huge campaign to save the sparrow under the aegis of Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate it.
Nearly 52 thousand bird feeders were distributed in every nook and corner of the world.
This effort also found a mention in the Guinness book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, that we even forget to offer water to the newspaper boy, the milkman, the vegetable seller, the postman or anybody else who come to our house in peak summer days.
Young friends, I want to have a chat with you too.
I am sometimes worried that much of our younger generation prefer leading life in their comfort zones.
Parents also raise their children in a very protective manner.
True there are other extremes also but most are brought up in this comfort zone syndrome .
Now the examinations have ended and you must be done with your plans to enjoy the vacation.
Summer vacations feel good inspite of scorching heat.
But as a friend, I want to suggest you certain tips about of how to utilize your vacation.
I believe some people will put them to use and they will tell me about that too.
Try to experience something that you have neither heard before , nor seen, nor thought of and yet there is a curiosity in your mind.
You must try new places, new experiences and new skills.
I will urge you to try to experience and satiate your curiosity on any subject during this vacation.
Try a new experiment.
The experiment must be positive and a little out of your comfort zone.
We all belong to the middle class and happy comfortable families.
How are the lives of your co- passengers, what do they do at the station when they alight from the train
In the evening, take your football or your volleyball or any other sports item and go to a colony of poor and lesser privileged people.
Play with those poor kids, you will experience a new kind of joy, the kind you would have never experienced in your life before-thats the kind of joy youll experience
Have you ever thought what changes would come in the lives of those kids who live in abject poverty when get the opportunity to play with you.
And I believe that if you go there once, your heart will tell you to go back again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
I am also worried that technology evolved to reduce the distance, technology came in to being to end the boundaries. But the end result of this is that six people in the same house are sitting in the same room but they are separated by unimaginable distances
Get away from technology, and try to spend some time with yourself.
This is a country full of diversity and if you look, then there can be someone who can teach us something new is just around the corner.
If you dont know how to swim, then learn swimming, try doing some drawing, even if you do not end up making the best drawing, try to practice putting hand to the paper
Sometimes if our heart desires to learn the trade of so called small people then let us learn it, why not
You want to learn to drive a car but then do you ever want to learn how to drive an auto-rickshaw
Youre able to ride a bicycle but have you ever tried to operate the three-wheeler cycle or rickshaw which transports people
You see, all these new experiments, these skills are such that they will bring you joy and will remove you from the limitations of life to which youre tied down
Keep showing the tricks to your friends.
I can tell you from my experience of going around the world, that the amount we can learn by seeing the world is something we cannot even imagine.
New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new areas.
But before leaving for a particular place, preparing for the journey and upon reaching your destination gathering information about it like a seeker of knowledge, understanding about the place and having discussions with the local people, if you make an effort in this manner then the pleasure of visiting the particular place would be something else
You will get to learn a lot that way.
Friends, this time around, the government of India has provided you with a great opportunity.
The new generation is more or less freeing itself from the shackles of cash.
It does not need cash.
It has begun adopting digital currency.
I know you do it, but have you ever wondered that you can earn using this very scheme
It is a scheme of the Government of India.
You must be downloading the BHIM App and using it.
But do refer it to others
If you involve twenty persons in a day, by evening, you wouldve earned two hundred rupees.
And this scheme is valid till the 14th of October.
It will be your contribution towards making of a digital India.
Youll become a sentinel of New India.
The joy of a vacation coupled with income
Refer and earn.
Generally speaking, in our country there exists an atmosphere of disdain towards the VIP culture.
The red beacon now has gone for good but nobody can say with certainty that the same in the mindset has also disappeared.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Shivaa Choubey calling from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I wish to say something on the governments ban on red beacons.
It made me feel very proud.
I am glad that today, even my time is equally important.
I dont have to be caught in a traffic jam and I dont have to stop for anyone as well.
I want to thank you from the core of my heart for this decision.
The exit of the red beacon through a government decision is part of a system.
Our concept of New India precisely is that in place of VIP, more priority should be accorded to EPI.
And when Im saying EPI in place of VIP, the essence of my sentiment is clear every person is important.
Every person has his or her own importance, every person possesses a sagacious aura, Mahaatmya, in a unique manner.
Let us warmly accept the importance of a hundred twenty five crore countrymen, let us respectfully embrace the Mahaatmya, the divine greatness of a hundred twenty five crore Indians and well garner strength of immense magnitude.
We have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I maintain time again that we should keep re - visiting the annals of our history, traditions and culture.
That lends us energy and inspiration.
This year, we the hundred twenty five crore countrymen are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya.
For one reason or the other, we confine ourselves to celebrating and observing centenaries of events mostly.
Just try and imagine it.
Even today breaking the shackles Social orthodoxy is so difficult.
How would society be a thousand years ago
Not many would know that Ramanujacharya relentlessly struggled against rampant social evils such as the class divide, the chasm between touchable and untouchables and the caste system.
Through his own conduct, he embraced those who were ostracized by society.
A thousand years ago, he launched an agitation allowing their entry into temples and succeeded in facilitating the same.
We are indeed fortunate that in every era, for eradicating social evils, noble souls, great men were born in this society itself.
Now that we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we should gain inspiration from him in our endeavour to foster social unity, to bolster the adage unity is strength.
In memory of Saint Ramanujacharya, the government of India is releasing a stamp tomorrow, the 1st of May.
I respectfully salute Saint Ramanujacharya and pay tributes to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, that is the 1st of May, carries one more significance.
In many parts of the world, it is observed as Labour Day.
And when Labour Day is referred to, labour is discussed, labourers are discussed, it is but natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today when I refer to Babasaheb, when I talk about Ramanujacharya, Im also reminded of the great 12th century saint social reformer from Karnataka Jagat Guru Basaveshwar.
In the 12th century, he had laid down his profound thoughts on labour workers.
He had mentioned in Kannada Kaay Kave Kailas...
it means, it is just through your perseverance that you can obtain Kailash, the abode of Shiva.
This means, it is only endeavour or Karma that leads you to attain Swarga, or heaven.
In other words, labour, hard work is Shiva.
Today when I refer to workers, it is but natural to remember Dattopant Thengdi.
My dear countrymen, a few days from now, we shall celebrate Budha Purnima.
Followers of Lord Budha across the world celebrate the festival.
I feel fortunate that the occasion of the great festival of Budha Purnima is celebrated as Vesak day by the United Nations.
This year it will take place in Sri Lanka.
On this holy event I shall get an opportunity to pay tributes to Lord Budha in Sri Lanka.
It will be an opportune moment to re-visit his ideals.
My dear countrymen, India has always advanced on the path of progress in the spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas...
And when we say Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, it is not limited to the confines of India.
And very specially to our neighbouring countries.
May our neighbouring countries be with us in our journey, may they develop equally.
There are many projects under way.
On the 5th of May, India will launch the South Asia Satellite.
The capacities of this satellite and the facilities it provides will go a long way in addressing South Asias economic and developmental priorities.
Natural resources mapping, tele medicine, the field of education, deeper IT connectivity or fostering people to people contact - this satellite will prove to be a boon in the progress of the entire region.
My dear countrymen, the weather is too hot and inhospitable , take care of your loved ones and take care of yourselves.
Parents in most parts of the country must be busy with their childrens examinations.
There would be a sense of relief where the examinations are over, but where the examinations are still on, there certainly would still be some amount of pressure.
However, at a time like this I would only say that students may listen again to what I had said in my Mann Ki Baat last time.
It was a historic war against injustice, which was fought under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu and led to the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh, on this significant day. And I hope that Bangladesh marches ahead on the path of progress.
I also assure the citizens of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, and a good friend, and we will continue to work together shoulder to shoulder to contribute towards the peace, security and development of this entire region.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are a shared heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh too, has been composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
There is a very interesting fact about Gurudev that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize, but Knighthood was also conferred upon him by the British.
After the Jallianwallah Massacre by the British in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the legendary figures, who raised their voices in protest.
And it was at the same time, that this event left a very deep impact on a twelve-year-old boy.
The inhuman massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, provided a new inspiration and mission in life to that young teenager, who until then had spent his days playing merrily in his fields.
And Bhagat, that 12-year old boy in 1919, evolved to be the martyr Bhagat Singh, our dear hero and inspiration.
On the 23rd of March, Bhagat Singh Ji and his comrades, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were hanged to death by the British, and we are all aware of that.
There was a sense of fulfillment on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru for having served Mother India - - there was no fear of death.
It would be impossible to express in words the story of the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
And the entire British Empire feared these three young men.
They were in jail, certain to be hanged, but still the British remained anxious about how to deal with them.
That is why, though the scheduled date was the 24th, they were hanged on the 23rd of March.
And later, their remains were brought to present day Punjab, and were secretly cremated.
Many years ago, when I first got the chance to go there, I could feel a certain vibration in that place.
And I would certainly urge the youth of our country to go to Punjab, whenever they get the chance, and visit the samadhi of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
That was the period when the desire for freedom, its intensity, and spread were on the rise.
On the one hand, brave hearts like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were inspiring the youth towards an armed revolution.
And on the other hand, exactly one hundred years ago on the 10th of April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had launched the Champaran Satyagraha.
This year marks the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha.
In Indias struggle for freedom, Gandhian thought and Gandhian practice became manifest for the first time in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the entire journey of Indias freedom struggle, especially in the context of the methodology of the struggle.
This was the period when, in the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, and the mill-workers strike in Ahmedabad, the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhis thoughts and practices was amply and clearly visible.
Just imagine that one man, who came to India in 1915, and had been in the country for barely two years.
And it was the Champaran Satyagraha that brought to the fore, Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, and his strong ability to gauge the pulse of Indian society. Mahatma Gandhi, through his demeanour and deeds, could inspire the poorest of the poor, the most illiterate, to unite and come together out into the open for the struggle against the British Rule
But if we reflect upon the Gandhi of a hundred years ago, the Gandhi of the Champaran Satyagraha, that would be a subject of deep study for anyone about to enter public life.
We can all learn from Gandhi Ji what it means to begin a life of public service, how hard one has to work, as Gandhi did.
And that was the period when all the stalwarts, that we hear about today: Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ji, and others were all sent to the villages by Gandhi Ji.
Ways and means to connect with the people and lending hues of freedom to their day to day work were taught.
Gandhis style of working had an incredible balance.
This desire of 125 crore countrymen for change, the effort to change, is what will lay a strong foundation of a New India.
125 crore Indians nurture a hope, a zeal, a resolve, a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we, for a moment, pause to look with empathy at the happenings in society around us, and if we try to understand these, we would be amazed to see that there are lakhs of people, who besides their own personal responsibilities are working selflessly, for society - the exploited, victimised, deprived for the poor and the oppressed.
That too silently, and with devotion, as if they are performing tapasya or sadhana.
There are many who regularly go to hospitals to serve patients.
There are many who rush to donate blood, when required.
There are many who try to provide food to the hungry.
If we look at it in its collectiveness, in an organised manner, it comes across as a major force.
And all these things are not necessarily achieved through the Budget, government projects, or government money.
But these will contribute to the realisation of the dream of this country, this New India, that is being nurtured by 125 crore countrymen, and this realisation will be achieved before their eyes.
In essence, every citizen must discharge his civic duties and responsibilities.
This in itself would be a good beginning to the New India.
As India gets ready to celebrate 75 years of Independence in 2022, come let us remember Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru.
Let us remember the Champaran Satyagraha.
Why dont we too, be a part of this journey from Swaraj to Suraaj by making our lives disciplined, and filled with resolve.
Over the last few months the country has witnessed a certain atmosphere in which people in large numbers have participated in the digital payment, Digidhan movement.
There has been a surge in various modes of digital payment after demonetisation.
The BHIM-App was launched just about two to two and a half months ago, but approximately one and half crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we must take our fight against black money and corruption to the next level.
Can 125 crore countrymen resolve to undertake 2500 crores digital transactions during this year
We have made an announcement in the Budget.
Our 125 crore countrymen, if they wish to do so, they need not wait for a year
they can do it in six months.
We can do this in our day to day lives.
You cant imagine how you can serve the country in this way and become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Recently, several Digidhan-mela programmes were organised to educate the people and to increase public awareness.
The resolve was to organise 100 such programmes all over the country.
About 80-85 programmes have already been conducted.
Seventy thousand traders also won the prizes instituted for them.
Each and every one of them also resolved to carry this mission forward.
And as was decided much earlier, the Digimela will be brought to a culmination on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On the completion of a hundred days, a grand closing ceremony will be held.
There is a provision of a bumper draw also in that.
I believe that in whatever time that is left before Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary, we should popularise and promote the BHIM-App.
We should contribute towards ensuring reducing the use of cash, of currency notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, I request people for suggestions in Mann Ki Baat, numerous suggestions pour in.
But I have seen that there is always an emphasis on the topic of cleanliness.
Gayatri, a young girl from Dehradun, who is a student of class 11, has phoned in with a message: - Esteemed Principal, Prime Minister Sir, my respectful greetings to you.
To begin with, heartiest congratulations on your victory in the elections, with a huge margin.
I wish to share the issue close to my heart with you.
I want to say that people will have to be made aware about the importance of cleanliness.
Every day I pass by a river, in which people dump a lot of garbage and pollute rivers.
The river flows under the Rispana Bridge before passing by my home.
I consider this to be a good omen.
This is exactly what I want - - that 125 crore countrymen be angered by filth.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction, rage, we will be compelled to act against this scourge.
When there is awareness and active participation in the movement, it has its own significance.
But cleanliness is more about a habit than a movement.
I am sure that this resolve that has arisen in the younger generation, in children, in students, in the youth, augurs well for achieving good results.
We know that at home and at feasts and social gatherings, we tend to serve ourselves more food than we need.
We put each and everything on offer, on our plates, but we fail to finish what we have taken.
We cant even finish half of what is on our plates and then leave it uneaten.
Have you ever thought about how much food we waste
Have you ever thought how many poor people can be fed if we dont thus waste our food
This is not something that needs to be taught.
As it is, in our families, mothers always tell their children to take only as much food they can eat.
So while it is good to care about society, this is beneficial to the family as well.
They have created Mobile Apps.
You will find such people somewhere in each and every state of India.
The lives of these people can inspire us not to waste food. We should take only as much as we can eat.
See, these are the pathways leading towards change.
And those who are health conscious always say that, there should always be some space left both in the stomach and on the plate.
Now that we are talking about health, 7th April is World Health Day.
United Nations has resolved to provide universal health coverage for all by 2030.
This year on the occasion of World Health Day on the 7th of April, United Nations has focused on Depression, which is the theme this year.
According to one estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world suffer from depression.
The problem is that we are unable to fully comprehend it even amongst those around us, and perhaps we also hesitate to talk about it openly, with our family and friends.
The person suffering from depression too doesnt speak out himself as he feels a sense of shame about it.
I want to tell my countrymen, that depression is not incurable.
There is a need to create a psychologically conducive environment to begin with.
The first mantra is the expression of depression instead of its suppression.
Share openly what you are going through, with your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers, and teachers.
Sometimes one is overcome by a sense of loneliness - - - students living in hostels are particularly vulnerable to it.
We are fortunate that we have been raised in joint families, large families, where there is communication, which eliminates the chances of getting into depression.
You can be sure that this the first step towards depression.
This is a very good way of dealing with it.
Depression can be the root cause of many mental and physical ailments.
Just as diabetes can be the root cause of all sorts of diseases, depression too, destroys all our abilities to sustain, to fight, to display courage and to take a decision.
There is another way.
By connecting with others, serving them and serving them selflessly, you will easily be able to shed the weight oppressing your own heart and mind.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
You all should start preparing for it right away. Collective Yoga festivals should be celebrated with the participation of millions.
If you have any ideas for the Third International Yoga Day, please do send me your suggestions and guidance through my mobile Application.
You could compose as many songs and poems on Yoga, as possible, as these can be easily understood by the masses.
Today I would like to say something especially to mothers and sisters also, since health and wellbeing have been a major part of our conversation today.
Recently, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The working-class women in our country - their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and this is a welcome trend.
But women also shoulder certain special responsibilities.
They also have to share the financial responsibilities of running the household, and because of that sometimes, the newborn has to bear some injustice of neglect.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision.
These working women will now be given maternity leave of 26 weeks, instead of the earlier 12 weeks, for their pregnancy and delivery.
There are now only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this matter.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
Flowers bloom.
Gardens and orchards sport a verdant green.
The melodious chirping of birds warms the cockles of our hearts.
Not just flowers, fruits too appear to be shining bathed in the sun rays on tree branches.
The flower heads of the summer fruit mango manifest themselves in the spring season itself.
At the same time bright yellow flowers of mustard swaying in their fields kindle hope in the hearts of the farmers.
Blossoming of bright red Jungle Flame flowers, better known as Tesu or Palash heralds the advent of Holi.
Amir Khusro has portrayed these moments of change of season in a very interesting manner.
Amir Khusro has written:Phool rahi sarson sakal banAmbwa phoote, Tesu phooleKoyal bole, daar daar,that is,Behold the mustard blooming everywhere, all aroundHere the inflorescence on the mango tree, there the Jungle Flame blossomsThe nightingale cant help but sing merrily on the branches.
When nature is at her joyous best, when the season is enchanting, we human beings too enjoy this to the fullest.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi, impart hues of happiness to a persons life.
In an ambience of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are about to bid adieu to the last month of Phalgun and are eagerly awaiting to welcome the arrival of the new month of Chaitra.
The Ritu of Vasant, that is, the season of spring is indeed the confluence of these two months.
Shobha Jalan has written to me on the NarendraModiApp that many in the public are not aware of the achievements of ISRO. And therefore she wants me to provide some information on the recent launch of 104 satellites and the Interceptor Missile.
Shobha Ji, thank you very much for paying attention to this shining example of Indias pride.
Whether it is eradicating poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, or disseminating knowledge and information, technology and science have made a mark for themselves.
15th February, 2017 is a day of immense pride for India.
Our scientists have brought laurels to the nation, witnessed by the whole world.
And we know that over the last few years, ISRO has accomplished various unprecedented missions with flying colours.
After the successful mission of sending Mangalyaan to planet Mars, recently ISRO scripted a world record in the arena of space.
India has created history by becoming the first country to launch successfully 104 satellites into space at one go.
And what is further heartening is the fact that this was PSLVs 38th successive successful launch.
This is a historic achievement for not just ISRO but for all of India.
This cost effective, efficient space programme of ISRO has become a marvel for the entire world
the world has admired this success of Indian scientists of India whole-heartedly.
Brother sisters, one out of these 104 satellites is extremely important.
It is Cartosat 2D, which is Indias satellite and the pictures clicked through it will be of great help in mapping of resources and infrastructure, evaluating development and planning for urban development.
Particularly for my farmer brothers and sisters, our new Satellite Cartosat 2D will be immensely helpful on a whole lot of subjects such as knowing how much water is there in our existing water sources, how this should be best put to use, what things to keep in mind in this regard.
Almost immediately after its launch, our satellite has sent back some pictures.
It has commenced functioning.
It is also a matter of exultation for us that this entire campaign was led and steered by our young scientists, our women scientists.
This tremendous participation of youth and women is a major glorious dimension in ISROs success.
On behalf of our countrymen, I heartily congratulate the scientists at ISRO.
Adhering consistently to the objective of bringing Space Science to the common man, for the service of the nation, they are creating one record after another.
One runs short of words in complimenting and congratulating our scientists, their entire team.
Shobha Ji has asked one more question and that pertains to the security of India.
It is about India having acquired a great capability.
This important matter has not been discussed much, but it has drawn Shobha Jis attention.
In the field of defence also, India has successfully test fired the Ballistic Interceptor Missile.
During its trial, this missile, based on interceptor technology, destroyed an enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km above the surface of the earth and thus marked its success.
Indias scientists have demonstrated this prowess.
Its core strength lies in the fact that if, even from a distance of 2000 km, a missile is launched to attack India, our missile can pre-emptively destroy it in the space itself.
When we witness new technology, or a new scientific feat, we are left overwhelmed with joy.
Inquisitiveness has played a significant role in the journey of progression of human life and development.
And those gifted with extra-ordinary intelligence do not let inquisitiveness to remain just that
This incessant spirit of enquiry leads to new inventions.
They do not rest till they obtain an answer.
If we try to take a birds eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress, we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination.
A full-stop is impossible.
Attempting to know the universe, the laws of Nature, the inner recesses of the human mind is an unending process.
And every technology, every new form of Science gives birth to a new era.
My dear young friends, while we refer to Science and the sheer perseverance of scientists, I have many a time said in Mann Ki Baat, that the attraction of Science for our young generation should increase.
The country needs more and more scientists.
Todays scientist becomes a potent catalyst for enduring change in the lives of our future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, No Science has dropped from the skies in a perfect form.
When Science is harnessed keeping in minds the needs of common folk, when ways and means to naturally use those principles for peoples requirements are devised, when appropriate mediums and technologies are deliberated upon, it paves the way for it to be considered the most valuable contribution for general humanity.
These innovations were identified and showcased, and people were being informed about them, along with touching upon such issues as harnessing them for the use by the common people and their mass production and commercial utilization.
I saw the volume of remarkable work done in that area.
In 2005, there was a very heavy downpour in Mumbai, which resulted in flooding, and even high tides in the sea, leading to terrible hardships.
What Im trying to infer is that in society, in the country, there are many who take on such roles.
And our society is also increasingly turning out to be technology driven.
Systems are getting technology driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
In the recent days, one can see a lot of emphasis being laid on Digi-Dhan.
Gradually, people are shedding their hard currency mindset and moving towards digital currency.
Digital transactions in India are witnessing a very rapid surge.
The young generation, in particular, is getting habituated to digital payments through its mobile handsets.
I believe this to be a good portent.
In recent times, Lucky Graahak Yojana and Digi-Dhan Vyapari Yojana have received overwhelming support.
And through these two schemes, the process to make digital payment a mass movement has been initiated
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred customers who have received prizes of one lakh rupees each.
There are more than four thousand traders who have got prizes of fifty thousand rupees each.
When I wanted to know the analysis, as to whether its only the young people who come forward or there are elders persons too, I was heartened to learn that among the recipients, there were 15 year old young persons, as well as elderly people aged 65-70.
Shriman Santosh Ji from Mysore, expressing joy, has written on the NarendraModiApp that under the Lucky Grahak Yojana, he received a reward of a thousand rupees.
He felt she had more a rightful claim on the reward he had got and gave away the thousand rupees to her.
He keeps imparting knowledge about digital usage to his passengers all the time.
He is extremely enthusiastic and motivates others also to go digital.
One young post-graduate student Pooja Nemade from Maharashtra keeps sharing her experience with friends about how her family members are using RuPay Card and e-wallet facilities and deriving enjoyment out of it and also as to how important the prize of rupees one lakh is for her.
She has taken up this in a mission mode and is bringing others into its fold.
To me, each and every individual involved in this mission constitute a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way you are a soldier in the cause of cleanliness and purity.
There is going to be a very big draw of prizes worth crores of rupees on 14th April.
There are still about 40-45 days left for that.
Can you do one thing in the memory of Babasaheb Ambedkar
We have recently celebrated 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Remembering him, you teach at least 125 persons about downloading the BHIM App.
Give special importance to Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary this time and the BHIM App.
For this, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to go from door to door associating everybody in order to place the BHIM App in 125 crore hands.
Since its beginning about two-three months ago, this movement has had a clear impact and has been a very big success in many townships, villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture makes a very major contribution to the fundamentals of our countrys economy.
Economic prowess of villages imparts momentum to the nations economic progress.
I wish to share a very happy news with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have toiled hard to fill our granaries.
The hard work of the farmers has resulted in a record production of food grains.
All signals indicate that our farmers have broken all previous records.
There has been such bountiful crop this time in the fields of our farmers that every day has appeared to be a celebration of Pongal and Baisakhi.
More than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year.
This is 8 percent more than the last record set up by our farmers.
Thus, it is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I want to specially thank the farmers of the country.
I also want to thank our farmers for keeping the poor in mind and adopting cultivation of various pulse crops also besides the traditional crops because pulses are the biggest source of protein for poor people.
I am happy that the farmers of my country heeded the needs of our poor people and cultivated various pulse crops on about 290 lakh hectare land.
This is not merely the production of pulses but a yeoman service rendered by the farmers to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way they whole-heartedly accepted my request, my prayer and put in their hard labour to get a record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, the government, society, institutions, organizations, in fact everyone, is making some or the other effort towards greater cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen working towards the cause of cleanliness in a conscious manner.
The government is continuously making efforts in this regard.
Toilet pit emptying exercise was carried out in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Toilet pits in six houses were emptied and cleaned and the officers personally demonstrated that the used up pits of twin pit toilet can be emptied and then re-used.
And, we can ourselves clean these toilet pits just as we do other general cleaning.
And it is quite natural also because when people see an IAS officer cleaning a toilet pit himself, the fact is naturally noticed by the country.
This has been proved too.
For a family of six members, the model of one standard Twin Pit Toilet gets filled in about five years.
After that the waste can easily be redirected to the other pit.
This waste deposited in the pit gets completely decomposed in six to twelve months time.
Others must also have experimented with initiatives similar to those undertaken by the Government.
Various government departments regularly observe Cleanliness Fortnight.
During the first fortnight of March, Women and Child Development Ministry along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will be laying stress on the Cleanliness Campaign.
We all hailed the commendable performance by our Divyang Players at Rio Paralympics.
The country is really proud of these Divyang friends for their achievement.
We get to learn something each moment from them.
Be it the field of sports or space science, the women of our country lag behind none.
They are moving ahead shoulder to shoulder and are bringing glory to the nation with their commendable achievements.
Our women players won a silver medal at the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy recently.
My heartiest congratulations to all these players.
The whole world celebrates 8th March as Womens Day.
Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao movement is moving forward with rapid strides.
This is no longer just a government programme.
It has now become a campaign of societal empathy and public education.
During the last two years this programme involved the common man
it has forced people from all corners of the country to think and ponder over this burning issue
It gives us great joy and happiness when we hear the news of festive celebration on the birth of a daughter.
In a way, a positive mindset towards our daughters is leading towards societal acceptance.
I have heard that in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child marriage has been banned under a special campaign.
About 175 child marriages have been prevented so far.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of over 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
In Kathua district in Jammu Kashmir, all departments have been connected with Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana under the Convergence Model and in addition to the convening of Gram-Sabhas, all efforts are being made by the district administrations for adoption of orphan baby girls and to ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, under the Har Ghar Dastak programme a campaign is being run to go to every village and every house to encourage education of daughters.
In Rajasthan Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya campaign is being run to readmit those girls into schools, who had dropped out, in order to encourage and motivate them to start studying again.
I mean to say that Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao movement has also developed in many shapes and forms.
This entire movement has become a peoples movement.
New imagination and new concepts have been linked and connected with it.
This movement has been moulded as per local requirements.
My dear countrymen, all of you get an opportunity to express your views from time to time in Mann Ki Baat.
You also connect actively with this programme.
I get to know so many things from you.
I get to know as to what all is happening on the ground, in our villages and in the hearts and minds of the poor.
I am very grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, these days, our country is enjoying the feast of rains
on the other, every corner of the country is celebrating festivals and fairs. And this will go on till Diwali.
Perhaps our ancestors intricately wove the annual seasonal cycle, the economy cycle and social life systems in a way that ensured, that under no circumstances, dullness crept into society.
We celebrated quite a few festivals in the days gone by.
Yesterday, Krishna- Janma Mahotsav, the festival of the birth of Lord Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Can anyone even imagine the greatness of his personality, that, even after thousands of years, the festival comes along with renewed novelty, a new inspiration with fresh energy.
And thats why today, as I converse with you, my attention is drawn towards two Mohans.
One is the Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan and the other is the Charkha bearing Mohan.
The Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan left the banks of the Yamuna for the sea beach of Gujarat, establishing himself in the city of Dwarika, while the Mohan born on the sea beach reached the banks of the Yamuna, breathing his last in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan, thousands of years ago, had amply used his wisdom, his sense of duty, his might, his worldview to avert war, to prevent conflict, a sign of the times then.
Today, as we discuss festivities, preparations are under way for a mega festival in India.
Not just in India, it is a part of the discourse in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, Im referring to the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served farmers in Champaran who were being discriminated against.
In order to dispel them, he closely served people suffering from leprosy.
He presented shining examples through the medium of service in his own life.
We can understand this from Bapus life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual and society, human beings humanity was everything.
Whether it was the Phoenix Farm or the Tolstoy Farm in Africa, the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he laid special emphasis on community mobilization in his own distinct way.
Community service and community mobilization are virtues which we have to imbibe into our real lives.
This would be the real way of paying true tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, the Karyanjali, the offering of deeds.
people from villages, cities, men, women, we should ask ourselves. As an individual, what can I add to the effort
What value addition could be there from my side
And being collective acquires its own strength.
In all the programmes of Gandhi 150, let there be a sense of collectiveness, let there be a spirit of service.
There could be a Ladies club
Routine tasks of a modern day Ladies club shall be taken up, but besides that, let all members of the Ladies club come together perform an activity of service
We can do a lot.
And I do believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen are endowed with 130 crore ideas there could be 130 crore endeavours.
There is no limit- whatever that comes to your mind- but only with a genuine wish, a noble intention, within the realms of harmony, and with complete dedication...
that too for the sake of enjoying that rare inner bliss, the core of Swaantah Sukhaayah.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I was in Dandi.
In our Freedom struggle, the salt satyagrah at Dandi was an important turning point.
There Id inaugurated a state of the art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
And do pen a couple of sentences or couplets to express your feelings.
In the times to come, many programmes, competitions exhibitions have been planned.
In this context I feel like sharing with you something very interesting.
There is a famous art show called the Venice Biennale, where people from the world over congregate.
This time, in the India Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, a very interesting exhibition based on memories of Gandhiji was organized.
Of special interest were the Haripura Panels.
You may remember that in the Haripura Congress Session in Gujarat, Subhash Chandra Bose being elected as President is recorded in history.
These Art Panels have a beautiful past.
Before the Haripura Session, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal of Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan, Nandlal Bose.
It was Gandhijis wish that the lifestyle of the people of India be depicted through the medium of art and this artwork may be exhibited during the session.
This is the same Nandlal Bose whose artwork adorns our Constitution
lends to the Constitution a new, unique identity.
The very commitment reverence of Nandlal Bose have made him, along with the Constitution, immortal.
Nandlal Bose toured villages around Haripura, concluding with a few works of art canvas, depicting glimpses of life in rural India.
This invaluable artwork was a high point of discourse at Venice.
Once again, along with greetings on Gandhijis 150th birth anniversary, I express my expectations from every Indian, of one resolve or the other.
One should do something for the sake of the country, society or just for someone else.
This will be a good, true genuine Karyanjali to Bapu, a tribute through a good deed.
This time around it will commence on the 11th of September.
During this period, all of us will move out of home, donating toil sweat through Shramdaan, as a Karyanjali to Mahatma Gandhi.
Home or the neighbourhood lane, street circles, crossings, or drains, schools and colleges ...
This time our emphasis must be on plastic.
the way one hundred twenty five crore countrymen ran a campaign for cleanliness with utmost enthusiasm and energy, and toiled tirelessly towards freedom from open defecation
in a similar manner, we have to join hands in curbing single use plastic.
This campaign has enthused people from all strata of society.
This will result in monetary savings, as well as one would be able to contribute towards protection of the environment.
This year, on the 2nd of October, when we celebrate Bapus 150th birth anniversary, we shall not only dedicate to him an India that is Open Defecation Free, but also shall lay the foundation of a new revolution against plastic, by people themselves, throughout the country.
I appeal to all strata of society, residents of every village, town city, take it as a prayer with folded hands
let us celebrate Gandhi Jayanti this year as a mark of our plastic free Mother India.
I urge all municipalities, municipal corporations, District Administration, Gram Panchayats, Government non Governmental bodies, organizations in fact each every citizen to work towards ensuring adequate arrangement for collection storage of plastic waste.
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come out with ways means proactively for appropriate disposal of all accumulated plastic.
It can be recycled
it can be transformed into fuel.
Today I want to touch upon a very important point from a Sanskrit Subhashit.
In our culture much glory has been ascribed to food.
We have even converted the knowledge about food into a science.
Under the Poshan Abhiyaan campaign, nutrition made available with the help of modern scientific methods is being converted into a mass movement all over the country.
People are fighting a battle against malnutrition in innovative and interesting ways.
Once, an interesting fact was brought to my notice.
The Mutthi Bhar Dhaanya initiative has turned into a big movement in Nashik.
In this novel scheme, during the harvest period, Anganwadi workers collect a handful of rice grain from the people.
This grain is used to make piping hot food for children and women.
In this way, the person contributing the handful of grain transmutes into a conscientious civil social worker.
This ritual is performed when the toddler starts feeding on solid food for the first time
solid and not liquid food
In 2010, Gujarat embarked upon planning to provide kids complimentary food on the occasion of 'Ann Praashan Sanskar' so that this initiative spreads awareness among the masses.
This is a great initiative that can be adopted anywhere.
In many states, people run meal campaigns on certain dates.
There is a wonderful confluence of a sense of service and satisfaction.
My Friends, there are many little things that can be employed in our countrys effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and affluent families are affected by malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as Poshan Abhiyaan across the country.
This time when I was thinking about 'Mann ki Baat', I was sure that a lot of questions would crop up about this subject and thats what exactly happened.
In the last few weeks wherever I went and met people, 'Man vs. Wild' gets a mention
I had never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of young people around the world.
And look what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan.
I have seen that whenever I have had the opportunity to go as Prime Minister, and of course credit also goes to International Yoga Day, the situation now is that wherever I go in the world or interact with someone, people invariably spend close to 5-7 minutes asking questions on yoga.
There must hardly be a major world leader who has not discussed yoga with me and this has been my experience all over the world.
The Discovery Channel plans to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their respective languages.
It is my firm belief that people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India.
But there is another interesting thing, some people ask me one thing albeit with some hesitation -Modi ji, you were speaking in Hindi and Bear Grylls does not know Hindi, so how did you carry on such a fast conversation between the two of you
Was this episode edited later
How many times did the shooting happen for this episode and how it happened
They ask with great curiosity.
Now, there is no secret in this.
Many people have this question in their minds, so I will unravel this secret.
Well, in a way it is no secret at all
The reality is that technology was used extensively in my conversation with Bear Grylls.
Whenever I spoke immediately there was a simultaneous translation into English or simultaneous interpretation and Bear Grylls had a small cordless instrument in his ear.
So I used to speak in Hindi but he heard it in English and because of that the communication became very easy and this is an amazing aspect about technology.
After the broadcast of this show, a large number of people have been discussing about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit sites associated with nature and wild life and animals.
What a glorious abundance of nature exists there.
You will be left wonderstruck
Your horizon will expand.
On 15th August, I urged all of you from the ramparts of the Red Fort to visit at least 15 places within a span of the next 3 years, 15 places within India and for 100 tourism, visit these 15 sites
Do take the family and spend some time there.
Your thinking will expand.
My dear countrymen, the concern and care for the environment in India seems natural.
Last month I had the privilege of releasing the tiger census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers there are in India
The tiger population in India is 2967, two thousand nine hundred sixty seven.
A few years ago, we were with great difficulty at a figure half of what we have at present.
The Tiger summit took place in 2010 at St. Petersburg, Russia.
At this summit, a resolution was taken expressing concern about the dwindling tiger population in the world.
It was resolved to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But this is New India, where we accomplish goals in the quickest time possible.
We doubled our tiger numbers in 2019 itself.
Not only the tiger population in India was doubled, but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.
At the time I was releasing the data on tigers, I also remembered the Asiatic lion of the Gir in Gujarat.
I had the charge of the Chief Minister of Gujrat at a period of time when the habitat of lions in the forests of Gir was shrinking.
Their number was decreasing.
We took several innovative steps, one after the other in the Gir.
In 2007, it was decided to deploy female guards.
There were improvements in the infrastructure to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about conservation.
But, we now have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion.
Therefore, we need to not only conserve our forests, flora and fauna, but also create an environment wherein they can flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda delivered on September 11, 1893.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that the 29th of August is celebrated as 'National Sports Day'.
On this occasion, we are going to launch the 'Fit India Movement' across the country.
We have to keep ourselves fit and the nation has to be made fit.
But today I am not going to reveal its specifics
you must wait for 29thAugust
And 2nd October as a day has been totally dedicated to riddance from plastic.
All of us with all our might must try to get rid of plastics from our home and everywhere outside our houses.
And I know that all these campaigns will make a big splash on social media.
Come, let us proceed with a new zeal, new resolve and renewed strength.
I will wait for your say and your suggestions.
Come, let us all march together to make the India which was dreamt of by our freedom fighters and realize Gandhi's dreams - 'Swantah: Sukhayah'.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
My fellow citizens, my namaskar to all of you
26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every nook and corner of the nation by all of us.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens and our commitment to democracy - these in a way make Republic Day also a festival of sanskaars, which makes our future generations cognizant of democracy and their democratic responsibilities, and also imparts to them the culture, moral values and norms inherent in our democracy.
But still in our country, the duties and rights of citizens are not being debated and discussed as intensively and extensively as it should be done.
Tomorrow is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
All of us pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the motherland, by observing silence for 2 minutes at 11 am on 30th January.
As a society, as a nation, the 2 minute tribute of silence on 30th January at 11 am, should become our instinctive nature.
This 2 minutes silence is an expression of our collective resolve and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country there is an innate respect for the military and the security forces.
I congratulate and felicitate the young heroes and their families who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
There are various categories of these gallantry awards like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Vishisht Seva Medal and Param Vishisht Seva Medal.
When we get to know the in depth details of their courage, bravery, valour in detail, we are filled with astonishment and pride and we also get inspired
While we were all delighted with the tidings of enthusiasm and celebration of 26th January, at the same time, some of our army Jawans posted in Kashmir for the defense of the country, achieved martyrdom due to the avalanche.
I respectfully pay my homage to all these brave soldiers, I bow to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I regularly do my Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April all these are for every family, months of most severe test
Normally it is one or two children in a home due to appear at their exams, but the entire family feels the burden of it.
This led me to believe that this is the right time for me to talk to my student friends, their guardians and their teachers, because for many years now, wherever I have gone, whomsoever I have met, examination appeared to be a great source of anxiety.
Troubled families, harassed students, tense teachers one sees a very strange psychological atmosphere prevailing in each home
And after going through all these outpourings, some ideas came to my mind, which I want to share with you today.
I received a telephonic message from Srishti.
You too listen to what Srishti has to say: -Sir, I want to tell you that during exam time, very often in our homes, in the neighbourhood and in our society, a very terrifying and scary atmosphere pervades.
This leads to a situation, where the students instead of feeling inspired feel tremendously down.
Those who will consider it a pleasure, will have achievements, while those who will consider exams a pressure, will have to repent.
And therefore my opinion is that exams are like a festival and, hence, must be celebrated.
And when there is a festive mood of celebration, the best within us comes out.
The true realisation of the strength of a society also takes place during festivals.
The best of everything finds a manifestation.
The festive atmosphere will lead to a burden-free environment.
And I especially urge the parents to create a festive atmosphere during these 3-4 months.
Actually from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup and from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these 3-4 months have examinations galore.
And therefore I shall say to you 'Smile More Score More'
If you are tense, then all the doors seem to be closed, nothing can enter from outside and nothing can come out from inside.
It was the same you, nobody had now told you the answer
What happened was that whatever was inside, came out immediately and the reason was that you were now relaxed.
And therefore the most effective medicine that exists for memory recall is relaxation.
And it is by my own personal experience that Im telling you that if youre under pressure then you forget even your own things but if you are relaxed, then you cant even imagine the kind of things you are able to remember, and these become extremely useful.
And therefore it is necessary to remember that 'a happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet
Sometimes it also appears that we are not able to perceive examinations in a proper perspective.
But it is not a test of your life.
It is not a test of what kind of life have you lived, how is the life you are living now and what is the life you aspire to live.
There must have been many occasions in your life, when, besides the examinations that you appeared at inside the classrooms with notebooks, you had to encounter and endure many tests and trials.
J.
Abdul Kalam.
He appeared at the test for recruitment into the Air Force, and failed in that.
No, never
One Richa Anand Ji has sent me this question: -Today what I see as the biggest challenge facing the education is that it has come to focus solely on examinations.
So I would like to know your views concerning the current direction of education and its future course.
Although she herself has given the answer to her query, but Richa Ji wishes that I too must put forth my views on the matter.
You tell me, you must be having a family doctor to whom all the members of your family must be going whenever needed.
You only look at his experience, his knowledge, and the graph of his success.
Richa Ji had also mentioned about PRATISPARDHA, meaning 'competition with others'.
It is a huge psychological battle.
It is a feature in the life of most of the successful players that they compete with themselves.
He kept on breaking his own records consecutively and consistently for about twenty years, everytime surpassing and outdoing himself and thus continuously forging ahead.
What a wonderful journey of life he has had, only because he followed the route of competing with himself rather than competing with others
Friends, in every field of life and when taking exams, if you were able to study peacefully for two hours earlier, then are you now able to do so for three hours
If you couldnt wake up at the decided time in the morning and were thus delayed, now can you get up early on time
You couldnt sleep earlier due to exam tension, are you able to sleep now
That energy is generated from within on its own.
If I have to put it in a simple language, then I would say that when you compete with someone else, there are three broad possibilities that arise - first, that you are much better than him
He further writes, My mother was not educated.
Yet, she would sit by me and ask me to solve problems in Mathematics.
Accept things as they are.
Whatever capabilities you posses, use these to mentor your children, and, howsoever occupied you might be, spare time for them, be with them.
Once you learn to accept, maximum number of problems will be solved there and then.
Expectation on the part of parents and teachers is the root cause of the problem.
Once, many years ago, one of our acquaintances was admitted to a hospital, following a heart attack.
Purushottam Mavlankar, son of Indias first Lok Sabha Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavlankar, had come to the hospital to see him.
In a way, we terrify a patient with constant references to his ailment.
I would like to convey to parents that we do exactly the same with our children.
Have you ever thought of creating an atmosphere of joy and laughter for children during exams
See it for yourself, the whole ambience will be transformed.
I have received an incredible phone call.
The gentleman does not wish to reveal his name.
When you listen to the call, you will come to know why he does not want to identify himself
And I started preparing most thoroughly for that.
I tried to explore and find out various methods of copying and wasted a lot of time because of that.
I could have very well secured the same marks by devoting that time to studying, which I wasted while pondering how to copy.
it is surely going to drag you into the abyss of failure in life.
Over and above that, if the invigilator catches you cheating during the exam, you will be utterly ruined.
And suppose, you are not caught, even then your own conscience will be burdened for lifetime.
When the time will come to counsel your own children, you will not be able to look them clearly in the eye, burdened as you will be with your own sense of guilt.
And, I have seen that there are people who squander so much of their talent, invest their entire creativity in finding ingenious ways and means in designing unfair methods.
If one devotes the same time and the same creativity in addressing issues pertaining to exams, one would never require any unfair means in the first place.
Results that you achieve through your own hard work and diligence will invest you with a phenomenal and extra-ordinary self-confidence.
What kind of a Prime Minister is this, who is asking children to come out and play during exams, they might say
People generally nurse the notion that if students indulge in sporting activities, they become careless about their studies.
This notion is basically unfounded.
Other parts of the body too require physical activity.
If only for five minutes, give yourself a break.
You will feel the onset of a certain ease in your work.
I do not know if everyone likes this or not, but I am saying it out of personal experience.
Deep breathing during these times is very beneficial.
And for deep breathing you do not need to confine yourself to your room.
Just be under the open sky, go to the roof top, do deep breathing for five minutes and return to your studies.
Some of you feel like studying more and more, keeping awake for late hours in the night.
Your concentration will increase.
You will feel a certain freshness.
Your overall efficiency will rise by leaps and bounds.
When I address election rallies, sometimes I suffer from a sore throat or a hoarse voice.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
Only when you get adequate sleep, your vocal chords will be able to rest fully.
Well, I had never given a thought to a possible connection between my sleep, my speeches and my voice.
Anyway, young friends, you are engrossed in preparing for your exams and here I am, engaging you in matters close to my heart.
Of course, it is quite possible that my words this morning will act as a relaxant for you.
The motto of Coast Guard is Vayam Rakshaamaha.
Last year, personnel of Coast Guard undertook a campaign of cleaning up of our coastal areas also, over and above their routine duties.
Thousands participated in this campaign.
Our Coast Guard women officers are pilots, work as Observers, and not just that, they command Hovercrafts as well.
In the backdrop of the fact that maritime security today has become an issue of global concern and the excellence displayed by Coast Guard in securing Indias coast line, I extend my heartiest felicitations to them on their 40th birthday.
1st February is the festival of Vasant Panchami.
In our country, Saraswati Pooja is done on Vasant Panchami
It is considered an occasion to worship Vidya, knowledge.
And not just that, it is a celebration of inspiration for brave hearts.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola is a perfect example of that.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the pious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio too infuses myriad novel hues of creativity and imagination.
People are writing in from far and wide.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to be connected with you.
Best wishes to you.
My fellow countrymen, Namaskar, many felicitations and seasons greetings to you on the occasion of Christmas.
Today is the day to give importance in our lives to service, sacrifice and compassion.
Jesus had said - The poor do not need our favours but our acceptance with affection.
In the Gospel According to Saint Luke, it is written that Jesus not only served the poor but also praised the service done by the poor, and this is what real empowerment is.
A tale associated with this incident is also very popular.
It has been mentioned in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasury of a temple
many rich people came and donated bountifully
then a poor widow came and parted with only two copper coins.
Now just two copper coins really do not amount to much.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre in BHU at Varanasi.
Today is also the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Venerable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
This country can never forget Ataljis contributions.
Under his leadership, the country proudly grew in stature in the field of nuclear power also.
Whether in the role of a party leader, Member of Parliament, a minister or the Prime Minister, Atalji always established an ideal.
I salute Atalji on his birthday and pray to God for his good health.
As a party worker I had the privilege of working with Atalji.
Many memories emerge before my eyes.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
In a way it is the beginning of two new schemes.
Everybody wants to understand and learn from each other.
To encourage this trend, to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e-payments, the Government of India is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders.
To encourage customers, the scheme is Lucky Grahak Yojana and to encourage traders the scheme is Digi Dhan Vyapaar Yojana.
Today, on 25th December, as a Christmas gift, fifteen thousand people will get rewards through a draw system, whereby each of the fifteen thousand winners will have one thousand rupees into their accounts and this will be not for today only
Everyday fifteen thousand people are going to receive rewards of one thousand rupees each.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there would be a mega bumper draw where rewards would be in crores of rupees.
Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana is mainly for traders and businessmen.
Traders should adopt this scheme themselves and should encourage their customers too in order to make their business cashless.
e. 300 million RuPay Cards in India, out of which 200 million RuPay Cards belong to poor families which have Jan Dhan accounts.
These 300 million people can immediately become part of this rewards scheme.
My dear countrymen, I feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology, making e-payments, making online payments is spreading very fast.
During the past few days, the cashless transactions, or cashless trading has increased by 200 to 300.
To give cashless trading a big impetus, Government of India has taken a very major decision.
The business community, our traders can well comprehend how momentous this decision is.
Those businessmen who adopt digital transactions, who develop online payment process instead of cash transactions in their trade activities will get Income Tax rebate.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Chandrababu Naidu is the head of a committee which is considering various schemes under this.
However, I have seen that the governments also have initiated and implemented many schemes.
Ive been told that Assam Government has decided to grant a 10 discount on property tax and business license fee if payments are made through digital transaction.
The branches of Grameen, that is, Rural Banks there getting 75 of their customers to make at least two digital transactions between January and March will get 50 thousands rupees rewards from the government.
And the interesting fact is that compared to last year the fertilizer sales of GNFC have gone up by 27 percent.
Brothers and sisters, the informal sector occupies a major segment in our economy and in our pattern of life and mostly these people are paid wages for their labour and hard work in cash.
They are paid their salaries in cash and we know that due to this, they are exploited also.
But now the practice of cashless payment is being adopted
the money is being directly deposited into banks.
My dear countrymen, I request every month before Mann Ki Baat that you please give your suggestions, share your thoughts
and of the thousands of such suggestions received this time on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp, I can definitely say that 80 to 90 suggestions were pertaining to the war against corruption and black money, there was mention of demonetization.
The third group is the one which has, while wholeheartedly supporting the action being taken, clearly stressed that this fight must be carried forward
corruption and black money must be completely destroyed and if this requires even more tough steps to be taken, those must be taken.
I am thankful to the countrymen for helping me by writing these innumerable letters to me.
Shriman Gurumani Kewal has written on MyGov - This step of reigning in black money is praiseworthy.
We citizens are facing some difficulties, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy that we are making a contribution in this fight.
We are battling corruption, black money etc on the lines of Military Forces.
When the people face problems, undergo hardships, rare will be a fellow human being who will not empathise.
I feel as much pain as you do.
But when a task is taken up with a noble objective, to realise a lofty intent, with a clear conscience, the countrymen stay firm courageously amidst all these trials and tribulations.
These people are the real Agents of Change, pioneers of transformation.
The people represent the will of the Almighty and their blessings become His blessings.
I thank the people of this country and salute them for participating in this Mahayagya against black money and corruption with utmost zeal.
Whether it is an individual, an organisation or a political party, everyone has to abide by law and one will have to.
Why are rules changed time and again
This government is for the sake of the people.
On the other hand, as Id said earlier, on the 8th to be precise, this drive, this war is an extraordinary one.
When I have resolved to wage battle against them, they too come up with new tactics everyday to thwart the governments efforts.
To counter these new offensives, we too have to devise appropriate new responses and antidotes.
In this context, I offer my heartiest salutations to my dear countrymen for one very remarkable thing.
Should I let out the secret
The secret is that my sources of such information are people themselves.
Information being received from common citizens is many times higher than that being obtained through government machinery.
And we are by and large being successful in our operations on account of the awareness and alertness that the people have displayed.
Can anyone imagine the level of risk, which the aware citizen of my country is taking to expose such elements
The information received has largely proved to be fruitful.
The government is committed to fight all such wrongdoings and maladies.
And when we have your active support, this fight becomes much easier.
Thirdly, there is another group of letter writers, also existing in large numbers.
We have retrieved it and turned it into an incisive law against Benami Property.
In the coming days, this law will also become operational.
For the benefit of the Nation, for the benefit of the people, whatever needs to be done will be accorded our top priority.
My dear countrymen, I had mentioned in last months Mann Ki Baat that even amidst these hardships our farmers toiled tirelessly and broke last years record in sowing.
It is a sign of good times for the agricultural sector.
The diligent hard work by this countrys workers, and farmers, and youth has scripted a new chapter of success with flying colours.
Recently India proudly inscribed her name in various sectors of the global economic scenario.
It is solely on account of the tireless exertions of our countrymen that on myriad indicators, India has charted an upward trajectory in global rankings.
Indias ranking has gone up in the Doing Business Report of the World Bank.
In the World Investment Report released by UNCTAD, Indias position has risen to third in the Top Prospective Host Economies for 2016-18.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament became the object of ire of our countrymen.
Indignation was expressed everywhere about the activities in the Parliament.
The President and Vice President also explicitly expressed their displeasure.
But even in such a situation, sometimes good things also take place which create a sense of satisfaction in the mind.
Amid the din in Parliament, an excellent task was accomplished, which has not attracted due attention of the country.
Brothers and sisters, today with pride and joy I would like to mention that a bill in connection with my governments mission on Divyangjan, that is, differently or specially abled people was passed in Parliament.
For this, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
On behalf of millions of Divyangjan of the country I express my thanks.
Our government is committed to the welfare of Divyaangs.
Our efforts and our trust were fortified by our Divyaang brothers and sisters when they returned with 4 medals from the Paralympics.
With their triumph, not only did they do the Nation proud, they pleasantly surprised many people through their capabilities and prowess.
Our Divyaang brothers and sisters are an invaluable heritage, a precious endowment, just as every citizen of the country is.
Today I am immensely delighted that the passing of this Law for the welfare of the Divyaangjan will open up additional avenues of employment for them.
In government jobs, the extent of reservation for them has been enhanced to 4.
Special provisions have been provided for in this Law for their education, facilities and also for grievances.
The extent of sensitivity of the government towards the Divyaangs can be assessed by the fact that during the last two years, the central government set up 4350 camps for Divyaangs, spent 352 crore rupees for distributing implements to 5,80,000 Divyaang brothers and sisters.
The government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the United Nations.
Earlier there were seven Divyaang categories
now adding fourteen new categories this has been expanded to twenty-one categories.
Many such new categories of Divyaangs have been included thereby providing them for the first time justice and opportunities.
For example, categories like Thalassemia, Parkinsons, or for that matter Dwarfism have been included.
In the cricket series against England, India has triumphed 4-0.
In this, the performance of some of the younger players deserves a special word of praise.
Test captain Virat Kohli batted extremely well and also provided inspiring leadership.
Indian Cricket teams off-spin bowler R.
Ashwin has been declared Cricketer of the Year as well as Best Test Cricketer by the ICC for the year 2016.
The Junior Hockey Team lifted the World Cup.
This festive occasion came to us after fifteen years as the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Heartiest congratulations to these young players for this grand feat.
This achievement is a very good omen for the future of our Hockey team.
Last month our Women players too won laurels.
Indian Womens Hockey Team won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago in the under-18 Asia Cup, Indian Womens Hockey Team secured the Bronze Medal.
I congratulate all our Cricket and Hockey team players from the core of my heart.
Last month, all of us were celebrating Diwali.
Like every year, this Diwali too, I had gone to the border, to the China border, to celebrate the occasion with our soldiers, our jawans.
I celebrated Diwali with ITBP men and army jawans on the lofty heights of the Himalayas.
They appeared charged with emotions, and not just that, the act of our countrymen of sending greeting messages, including the defence forces of the nation in their rejoicing had elicited a wonderful response.
And this gave rise to a thought in MyGov that out of these, selected items could be compiled to make a coffee table book.
We are devoted to defending the country every moment.
Bu we do miss our near and dear ones back home during festivals.
But, to tell you the truth, this time we did not feel so.
Never did it appear to us even once that we are not at home for the festivities.
It felt as if we were celebrating Diwali together with a hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, this warmth of emotion, this fervour that has been kindled in the hearts of our defence forces, our soldiers this Diwali, should this be confined to only a few occasions
A few days ago, all Pradhans from the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to see me.
They were from the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
They had come from different villages of the Kashmir valley, there were around 40-50 Pradhans.
I got an opportunity to speak to them at length.
I am feeling happy today that these Pradhans, who had come from the Kashmir valley, kept their word in letter and spirit.
The sheer volume of students, who appeared in the Board Examinations, is a clear indication that our children from Jammu Kashmir are committed to attain newer heights of progress, to build a bright future through the medium of education.
For their resolute zeal I congratulate these students and I also felicitate their parents, their kith and kin, their teachers and all the Gram Pradhans as well from the depths of my heart.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people for suggestions for Mann ki Baat, I can say that almost all the suggestions that were received echoed one theme.
Everyone wanted me to speak in more detail about the 500 1000 rupee notes.
On the 8th of November at 8 in the evening, in my Address to the Nation, I had talked about launching a mega campaign to bring about reforms in the country.
When I had taken this decision and presented it before you, then also I had said openly that it was not an ordinary decision, it was one fraught with difficulties.
And I had stated then also that this decision was so enormous that it would take us at least 50 days to come out of its after effects and only then would we be able to move towards normalcy.
These maladies have been afflicting us for the past 70 years and the campaign for getting rid of these can never be an easy task.
I can very well understand the problems you are going through
500 and 1000 rupee notes and such a vast country, wide proliferation of currencies, billions and trillions of bank notes and amidst that, this decision the whole world is minutely observing, every economist is analysing it, evaluating it.
And our country will emerge shining like gold does after a test by fire.
Across the country, central government, state governments, all units of the local self government institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, over one and a half lakh post offices, over a lakh Bank-Mitras are relentlessly at work, day and night, with complete dedication.
In the midst of immense and varied stress, all these individuals are working hard, maintaining a calm and composed demeanour, taking it as a Yagya of Service to the Nation, an attempt towards a great transformation.
And as a precise consequence of this diligence, there are clear indications that India will succeed handsomely in this endeavour.
And I have seen that in the midst of such difficulties, all personnel of banks and post offices are working very hard.
The greatest validation of SHAKTI, strength, comes when the same is put to test.
But vices are so widespread and deep-rooted that even today there are people whose vicious habits refuse to die.
Even now, some people think that they can re-introduce into the system, money from corruption, black money, unaccounted wealth and Benami money (money in unknown persons name), using some route or the other.
They seek illegal means to save their ill-gotten wealth.
My name is Aashish Paare.
I am an ordinary citizen of Village Tiraali of Tehsil Tiraali in District Harda of Madhya Pradesh.
And I am with the whole country on this.
I am calling from a village in Koppal district of Karnataka.
My name is Yellappa Velankar.
You have taught a lesson to black money mongers and the corrupt through the demonetization of 1000 and 500 rupee notes.
It gives us such a great happiness and a sense of pride to know that the common man in my country has such a wonderful capability.
So people go and eat there and make payments on their next visit after 2, 4 or 6 days.
But, I did not know Chai Par Charcha could be linked to a marriage also.
People are themselves finding ways.
And just look at this change.
See, how the village life is also getting transformed.
Some people are getting instant benefits from this campaign.
The nation will reap these benefits in the days to come but some people have got benefits instantly.
Now all of us know very well that the poor people always like to clear their dues 2-3 days in advance.
It is the well-off people, who do not pay their taxes and bills as they have higher connections and know that nobody is going to ask or do anything against them.
Thus there are big arrears of payments, which remain pending. All municipalities receive hardly 50 of their tax revenues.
But, this time after the decision taken on the 8th instant, people rushed to deposit their old currency notes.
Imagine the difference - from 3 to 3.
5 thousand crores to 13 thousand crores.
Many such examples are coming to light where direct benefits of this demonetisation can clearly be seen.
Brothers and sisters, our villages and our farmers are strong pillars of our economy.
Our farmers have discovered new avenues amidst the present difficulties.
The government has also taken many important decisions, wherein priority has been accorded to our farmers and villages.
Small traders and businessmen of our country provide employment opportunities besides adding to the economic activities.
In the last budget we had taken an important decision that just like the big malls, small shopkeepers in the villages will also be allowed to operate round the clock and no rule will stop them from doing so because I felt that when the big malls can function 24 hours, why the poor village-shopkeepers should not get the same facility
A number of initiatives were taken to grant them loans under Mudra Yojana.
These small traders were provided loans worth lakhs and crores of rupees under Mudra Yojana because there are crores of such small traders and they impart momentum to the business activities worth billions of rupees.
And, I want to tell our small trader brothers and sisters that this is a ripe opportunity for them too to make their entry into the digital world.
You too download Apps of Banks on your mobile phones.
I am sure you can handle the entire business in your village using this technology.
That is why, I specially urge our worker brothers and sisters to participate in this scheme because after all I took such a momentous decision for the benefit of the poor people, the farmers, the workers, the deprived and the suffering people of the country and, hence, these benefits must reach them.
I specially want to talk to our young friends today.
It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
You know how many opportunities there are today for a cashless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Every bank provides online banking facility.
Every bank in India has its own mobile App.
Various types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have Rupay Cards.
Used scarcely earlier, after 8th November the poor people have started using Rupay Cards and this usage has seen almost 300 surge.
Just as there is a prepaid card for mobile phones, prepaid cards are also available in banks to facilitate expenditure.
And, this procedure is as simple as sending messages through WhatsApp.
Even an illiterate person today knows how to send and also forward WhatsApp messages.
Not only this, with the simplification of technology, we do not require any big smart phones for this purpose.
Cash can be transferred even with a phone with ordinary features.
And I know it very well that all of you are actively contributing in this great task.
But, my dear young friends, I once again tell you that I need your help in this task.
Every technology needed for online spending will definitely be available on your mobile phone.
But not only this, you must devote half an hour, one hour or two hours daily to educate at least 10 families about what this technology is, how this technology is to be used, how to download the Apps of your banks, how to spend money from ones account, how to make payment to shopkeepers.
Also teach the shopkeepers to conduct their business with this technology.
You have to voluntarily lend your leadership to this great campaign, this Maha Abhiyan, to create a cashless society, to eradicate corruption from our country, to abolish the scourge of black money and to help people in overcoming their difficulties and problems.
Once you teach the poor people about the usage of Rupay Card, they will shower their blessings upon you.
We can emerge and take our place in the world as a new modern India within a period of one month.
And you can do this through your mobile phone by going to 10 houses daily and bringing 10 families daily under the ambit of this campaign.
We shall carry forward this struggle to free our country from the evils of corruption and black money.
There are many countries in the world where the youth have changed the nations life and it has to be accepted that it is the youth which brings about the great changes, which creates revolutions.

Deepawali is celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm throughout our country.
In India almost on all 365 days of the year, one festival or the other is celebrated in some part of the country.
Somebody watching from a distance would genuinely feel that festivity is a synonym for the Indian way of life, and this is natural too.
What crop has been harvested by the farmers and how that yield is to be made a part of the festivities, what food habits will be appropriate in a particular season from the health point of view.
Indias tradition of celebrating festivals has been one to strengthen our love for nature and to develop each individual, right from childhood, as a cultured person.
And science has proved that on these days changes take place impacting the sea-water
Now when we celebrate Diwali, as I said, each of our festivals carries a message and teaches us something.
it is also the darkness of superstition and blind-faith, darkness of ignorance, darkness of poverty and also darkness of social evils.
The less privileged also put in all their efforts to clean their modest earthen utensils because it is Diwali time.
We have to expand and spread this habit and tradition.
Now, the festival of Deepawali is not confined to the borders of India.
In almost all countries of the world, Deepawali is celebrated in one way or the other.
The Prime Minister of Canada has shared on Twitter a picture of him lighting a lamp on the occasion of Diwali.
British premier Theresa May organised a reception in London involving all communities on Deepawali in which she herself participated.
And, there would hardly be a city in UK where Diwali is not celebrated with a great pomp and show.
The Prime Minister of Singapore has posted a picture on Instagram and has shared it proudly with the whole world.
And, what is that picture about
It shows 16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament standing outside the Parliament all clad in Indian Sarees and this photo has gone viral.
All this has been done on the occasion of Deepawali.
In Singapore, Diwali celebrations are in full swing in almost all neighbourhoods.
The Australian Prime Minister has conveyed his greetings to the Indian community and has called upon all sections of societies to join in the Diwali festivities in various Australian cities.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had recently come to India.
What I mean to say is that the festival of lights, Deepawali is becoming a festival of inspiration for the world community also to move from darkness to light.
News of such mishaps, fire breakouts and even tragic casualties become a cause of big concern on Deepawali.
To add to these woes, there is a situation of even the doctors in big numbers being unavailable as they too are away celebrating Deepawali with their families.
It is not restricted to just one day.
It is a big occasion there which lasts for four days.
There is a very profound social message behind this tradition.
When I speak of the Deepawali festival or about the Chhathh Pooja this is actually an occasion to convey my best wishes to you.
But, there is one more thing I have to do.
Our Jawans from BSF, CRPF, Indo Tibetan Border Police, Assam Rifles, Navy, Army, Air Force, Coast Guard and many more as I am not able to include all by names are valiantly facing great hardships in the line of duty.
Just one message can enhance their capability and our country has shown it.
I earnestly express my gratitude to all our countrymen and women for this gesture.
Many messages and other expression forms have been received on Sandesh to Soldiers hashtag.
As a symbol of these, I would like to read a poem which has been sent by Shriman Ashwani Kumar.
Prime Minister, I am Shivani Mohan calling.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign has been launched on this Deepawali and is proving to be a morale booster for our brothers.
Im from an Army family.
My husband is an Army officer.
Be it a calamitous natural disaster or a law and order crisis or having to deal with enemies or to display courage in motivating misguided youth to return to the mainstream of life, Our Jawans are motivated by a sense of patriotism while rendering service to the nation.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh as a State is now Open Defecation Free, has attained the status of OFD.
In the village at that time there was supposed to be a meeting of the Gram Sabha, so he went to the meeting where a discussion about construction of toilets was in progress.
And he found that some of the families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of funds.
Vikas Thakur demonstrated his heroics by contributing one thousand rupees each from his pocket to the 57 families and thus strengthening the Cleanliness Campaign.
And that is how Himachal Pradesh has been empowered to become an Open Defecation Free state.
a tribal village panchayat named Idmalakudi is there.
It is rarely visited by people.
It came to the attention of Engineering students from the nearby urban areas that this village was in dire need of the toilets.
The building material needed to construct the toilets whether it was bricks or cement, the entire construction material was carried by the young men on their shoulders, spending an entire day walking in those forests.
My fellow citizens, the government plans for the welfare of the people through many of its schemes, and usually when the second scheme follows the first one then the previous scheme is supposed to be discontinued.
But generally due attention is not paid to this.
The old schemes continue along with the newly implemented schemes and there is also a wait for the next scheme on the anvil.
But who bothers about such things in the government
We are trying to provide a smoke free life to 5 crore such families and we are successfully advancing in that direction.
The small trader, the small businessman, the vegetable vendor, the milk vendor, the one running a hair cutting salon has always been entrapped in the grip of the money lender, repaying interest all his life.
The stand up scheme and Jan Dhan account scheme are aimed at freeing these people from the clutches of notorious moneylenders.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, the 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great son of India who vowed to unite India and made this the sole object of his life.
Sir, I want to know how we can check such unfortunate events and incidents from taking place.
My dear countrymen, this is not the pain of an individual person.
One Sardar, as history goes, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the second great man after Chanakya who carried on the stupendous job of uniting our country.
Unity in diversity is the strength of our country.
That is Indias great characteristic quality.
The Mantra of national unity is the very foundation of a strong and great India.
Sardar Sahebs journey started with a struggle for farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb had a big role in taking the Freedom movement to the farmers.
But, Sardar Saheb was not just a man of struggle but also a man who created great things.
He believed in the cooperative movement.
Today, we often hear the name AMUL.
He had given this idea in 1942 which now is before us in the shape of AMUL.
It is a living example as to how Sardar Saheb had foreseen the way to prosperity of the farmers.
I pay my respectful homage to Sardar Saheb.
Service, truth and everybodys well-being was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
It was then an era when evils such as untouchability, casteism and the chasm between the rich and the poor were at their peak.
Guru Nanak Dev picked Bhai Laalo, as his co-worker at that crucial juncture.
I pay my deeply felt respectful homage to Guru Nanak Dev on the occasion of the forthcoming Prakashotsav.
My dear countrymen, once again let us dedicate this Diwali to our Jawans.
My best wishes and greetings on Diwali to all of you.
I wish that all your dreams and resolves get fulfilled in every possible way
We recently lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri Sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute these valiant soldiers and pay my tributes to them.
This cowardly act has shocked the entire Nation.
There are strong emotions of widespread grief as well as anger across the country.
And, this is not only a loss for the families who have lost a son, a brother or a husband.
We are proud of our army.
I also wish today to specially talk to those living in Kashmir.
Kashmiris are now beginning to recognize well the true face of the anti-national forces.
And as they understand the truth better, they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace.
Every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest.
Farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country. Economic activities too should be back on track.
Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I shall also tell the security forces that all our capabilities, power, laws, rules and regulations are basically meant to maintain law and order in order to provide a life of peace and happiness for the common people of Kashmir.
We shall strictly abide by this.
At times, people thinking differently from us also provide new ideas.
Recently, Harshvardhan, a young student of Eleventh Class has put before me a different type of thought.
So, I was trying to find some way to be of some service to the nation.
I shall become a capable citizen so that I can serve the country well.
Brother Harshvardhan, I am happy to know that despite this atmosphere charged with anger, you are able to think in a healthy manner at such a young age.
Then, Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country.
He gave the mantra-Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation.
When the medal was awarded to her, she said Through this medal I have actually defeated the disability itself.
This time 19 athletes, including three women, took part in Paralympics from our country.
Compared to normal sporting activities, when the DIVYANG play, in addition to physical ability and sporting skills, what are needed even more are will power and resolve.
As far as Athlete Deepa Malik is concerned, she has won laurels many a times by emerging victorious repeatedly.
Varun C.
Bhati won a bronze medal in High Jump.
Medals in Paralympics have a significance of their own, but going beyond that these medals have made a very big contribution in transforming the attitude towards our DIVYANG brothers and sisters in our country, our society and our neighborhoods.
Olympic Games were held at the same venue only a few days ago.
Can anyone ever imagine the DIVYANG athletes breaking a record set during the general Olympic Games
It happened this time.
In the 1500 meter race, Abdellatif Baka of Algeria set a new record by completing the 1500 meters race taking 1.
Government of India had organized a Mega Camp for DIVYANG persons and a number of world records were established that day.
A visually challenged little girl child Gauri Shardul, hailing from far flung forest area in the Dang District, can recite the complete Ramayana epic as she has learnt it by heart.
I got an opportunity to publicly release a book that day wherein success stories from the lives of some DIVYANG persons had been compiled.
These were very inspiring incidents.
Three world records in a single day by DIVYANG people is a matter of great pride for our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we had launched Swachha Bharat Mission two years ago on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of our revered Bapu.
Friends in the media have also played a constructive role.
I also know that we still have to go much farther.
Yet, the beginning has been good so far.
My congratulations to those who have made it possible, and best wishes to those who are trying to reach the target.
I appeal to all of my countrymen that to maintain the dignity of our mothers and sisters and for the sake of health of our children, our country needs to get rid of this scourge.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated his birth centenary and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
By dialing this number 1-9-6-9 you will be able to know the progress of construction of toilets in your city and will also be able to submit an application for construction of a toilet.
You must avail this facility.
especially the younger generation must utilize it optimally.
Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward in this endeavour.
They can sponsor young professionals willing to work for Swachchhata Mission.
They can also be sent to various districts as Swachchha Bharat Fellows.
It will not be sufficient to keep this Cleanliness Campaign confined to beliefs and habits.
Imbibing cleanliness as a nature is not enough.
Ministers, Chief Ministers as also Mayors and Commissioners of metropolitan cities will participate in brainstorming sessions on the sole issue of cleanliness.
All these topics will be discussed.
They themselves put in physical labour and contributed significantly in constructing around 9000 toilets.
Government of India has also chalked out an annual calendar for its departments.
Each department is to focus exclusively on cleanliness for a period of 15 days.
In the coming October month, from 1st October to 15th October, Drinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development Department these three are going to work under a designated roadmap in their respective areas.
Then during last two weeks of October from 16th October to 31st October, three more departments, namely Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs are going to take up cleanliness campaigns in the concerned areas.
I request the citizens also to get involved, wherever they feel that they too can pitch in these programmes.
You might have seen that a cleanliness survey campaign is also carried out these days.
Earlier, the cleanliness status was presented before the countrymen after conducting a survey of 73 cities.
Now, this survey will be conducted in about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji. Swachchh Bharat Mission is completing two years on this day.
I keep on urging everyone to buy some khadi items between Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
Let us all remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and take a pledge to do something for the country.
This in itself was a very inspirational event in Indias national life.
Now, many youngsters, small groups, people from the corporate world, schools and some NGOs are jointly going to organize Joy of Giving Week from 2nd October to 8th October.
This is a kind of a Donation Festival, a Daan Utsav.
I convey my best wishes to all those young persons who are undertaking this mission.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the last man standing in the queue.
How can the poorest of the poor avail of benefits of development
Work for every hand, water to every field through only these two words he presented his entire economic agenda.
The country should celebrate his centenary year as GARIB KALYAN VARSH, Year for Welfare of the Poor.
We can alleviate poverty when everyone including society and governments focuses attention on measures to provide benefits of development to the poor.
The place where I live was known as Race Course Road since British rule but now in the centenary year of Pandit Deen Dayal Updhyay this has been named Lok Kalyan Marg.
My dear countrymen, I had started Mann Ki Baat on Vijayadashmi two years ago.
My dear countrymen, from next week festive season will be ushered in with Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi, preparations for Deepavali and all such activities.
And that would be the true prayer to Shakti, only then can we celebrate together the festival of victory.
Let us celebrate victory on Vijayadashmi.
He played a pivotal role in helping India win Hockey Gold Medals in Olympic Games of 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of us cricket lovers know Bradmans name very well.
He had complimented Dhyan Chand ji by saying that he scores goals like runs.
One Shri Sachin has written to urge that in Mann Ki Baat this time a mention may please be made about Sindhu, Saakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
We have to go a long way in the field of sports.
Our parents, even today, insist on focusing on studies and academics.
Sports are considered a waste of time in our society.
We need to change this mindset.
Thousands of people have expressed similar sentiments.
There is no denying the fact that we could not perform up to the expectations.
Some of our players could not even touch during these Games their own performance level which they had achieved during the domestic events in India.
In the medals chart, our tally was only two medals.
However, it is also a fact that if we look closely, we shall find that despite missing medals, Indian players gave a very good account of themselves for the first time in some of the events.
See, our Abhinav Bindra very narrowly missed the medal and got fourth place in Shooting.
Dipa Karmakar produced a superb performance in Gymnastics, although she remained at the fourth place and missed a Bronze by a very narrow margin.
But, how can we forget that she is Indias first daughter to qualify in Gymnastics for the Olympics and also to reach the final round.
The pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna met almost a similar fate in Tennis.
Our athletes this time gave a creditable performance.
Ushas feat, Lalita babar qualified for the finals in track and field.
Thus, the future surely seems bright for us.
I have announced setting up of a committee.
We have to prepare a far reaching plan keeping in view the Olympics in 2020, 2024, 2028.
I urge the State Governments also to set up similar committees to find out as to what we can do in sports.
What can each state do
The states can take up one or two sports of their choice and display their strength.
I urge our sports associations also to do objective and impartial brainstorming on this.
In our life, a teacher holds the same place which a mother does.
We have also seen such teachers who care more for their pupils than for themselves.
They devote their lives for their disciples, their students.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopi Chand ji is being talked about everywhere.
I see Gopi Chand ji today as an excellent teacher besides being a very accomplished player.
And, on Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopi Chand ji for his hard work, his dedication towards sports and his manner of finding happiness in the success of his disciples. We always feel the contribution of our teachers in our lives.
Not only this, he always said that a good teacher can only be one who keeps the student within always alive.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji showed this by living as a teacher and by keeping alive the student within him despite holding the highest office of the President.
If you have a photograph with your teacher or an incident connected with your teacher or an inspirational thing associated with your teacher, please do share the same on NarendraModiApp.
By publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav, he turned this religious occasion into a festival of national awakening and social refinement.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us the inspirational mantra Swaraj, that is, freedom is our birthright.
But now we live in independent India.
I have seen that this time, many people have written to me mentioning Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
They are worried about environment.
One Shri Shankar Narayan Prashant has strongly urged Modi ji, kindly tell the people through your Mann Ki Baat that they should not use Ganesh idols made of Plaster of Paris.
I request you all as to why should we not use clay in making Ganesh and Durga idols and revert to our old tradition.
This will help in environment preservation, prevent pollution of our rivers and ponds and also provide protection to small creatures living in water.
We keep learning something or the other from great men and women, saints, sages, holy people.
Lesser known artists could be taken and it is not necessary to have a big studio and a big camera.
We have Bangladesh as our neighbour.
I extend my thanks to Bangladesh also for collaborating with us in this initiative.
I congratulate the friends in All India Radio too for making their contribution in our foreign policy also.
I have full faith in the power of my 125 crore countrymen.
That is all for today, many many thanks.
Early this morning, I had an opportunity to spend some time with some young people from Delhi.
And I believe, in the days to come, the spirit and fervor of sports will envelop every young person in the country.
In Delhi this morning, the Government of India had organised a very good event, Run for RIO, Play and Live, Play and Blossom.
Its a kind of severe and dedicated tapasya.
However much one cherishes all kinds of food, one has to sacrifice that.
Even their parents leave no stone unturned for the sake of their children.
Sportsperson are not made overnight
Im also ready to do this on your behalf
the prime minister of the country is ready to be a postman to convey your good wishes to these players.
Do send your best wishes to our sportspersons in Rio on the NarendraModi App.
Ill convey these to our contingent.
and today, as I speak on the Rio Olympics, I would like to mention the name of a poetry lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay a student of the Punjab Central University, who has sent me a poem.
Its possible that many poets would have written poems, some may be planning to write, some may even compose their verses into songs, in all languages.
But here I would like to share with you the poem sent by Suraj Ji.
The country, in fact the world paid glowing tributes to him.
The mere mention of Abdul Kalamjis name brings to mind vivid images of science, technology, missiles in fact the entire spectrum of strengths and capabilities of India in the days to come.
You cannot shackle technology.
In the absence of research and innovation, technology will become a burden, just as still water stagnates and even stinks.
And if we go on just using old technology without recourse to research and innovation, we will become outdated in this rapidly changing world and age.
And that is why the government too has taken steps to attract the new generation toward science and research innovation in the field of technology.
Wherever such Tinkering Labs are established in schools, those would be given 10 Lakh rupees and further 10 Lakh rupees will be provided for maintenance during the period of five years.
And when I talk of Atal Incubation Centres, the government has considered allocating the huge sum of 10 crore rupees for this also.
India is grappling with diverse challenges.
We see problems in daily life.
The Government of India wants to specially reward technology developed to find solutions to our problems.
I firmly believe that the real tribute to Abdul Kalamji will consist of harnessing research and innovation for developing technology to find solutions to problems we face in day to day life, and ridding us of the difficulties we face to make things easier for us all.
That will be the real tribute to Abdul Kalamji.
Central government and State Governments are working hand in hand with their utmost efforts to provide relief and assistance to the flood-affected.
In todays fast paced, rat race of life, at times we dont have time to think about ourselves.
The drug then loses its efficacy and one has to fight the battle anew, develop new medicines, do new research it takes years and till then these diseases create other complications.
Thats why we have to be very aware about that.
Microbes spreading TB and malaria are bringing about rapid mutations in themselves, rendering medicines ineffective.
In medical parlance it is called antibiotic resistance.
Hence it is indeed necessary to follow rules in the administration of antibiotics.
The government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance.
It is true that in the last decade there has been a decline in maternal mortality rates but even now, we are not able to save the lives of a large number of pregnant women.
Keeping in view these issues, in the last few months, the Government of India has launched a new campaign Prime Minister Safe Motherhood Campaign.
Under this, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will get a check-up at government health centers free of cost.
There are thousands of doctors who have implemented what I said.
But India is such a vast country.
We need lakhs of doctors to join this campaign.
These are discussed collectively in the country and across the world.
In India, this has been accorded great importance for centuries.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra too, Bhagwan Shri Krishna talks of trees.
the Anushasan Parv of the Mahabharta elaborates this concept at greater length.
It is stated in the Anushasan Parv that whosoever plants a tree begets an offspring in the form of that tree.
There can be no doubt about this fact.
He who donates a tree, that tree in return becomes a ladder to salvation just like children.
Therefore it is appropriate that parents desiring their well-being should plant tree and rear them like their own children.
A few days ago, I came across a mention of Sonal, a young daughter from Pune.
It touched my heart.
Shri Khandu Maruti Mhatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village of of Junner Taluka of Pune got his granddaughter Sonal married in a very inspiring manner.
What did Mhatre Ji do in Sonals marriage He gifted all his relatives, guests and friends with a sapling of Kesar variety of mango.
I saw a picture of this marriage in social media.
I was surprised to see that in the marriage festivities, instead of members of the wedding party, saplings were more visible
That picture really touches ones heart.
I think that Sonal, who herself is an agriculture graduate, came upon this idea.
And such experiments are done by many people.
I remember, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat the temple of Ambaji there is visited in the month of Bhadrapad by lakhs of devotees travelling by foot.
A certain NGO decided to distribute saplings as Prasad to the devotees, and the devotees were told that Mata Ambaji will keep on showering her grace, if they took care of the saplings, till their maturity into trees in their homes and villages.
And lakhs of such saplings were distributed to the devotees traveling on foot to Ambaji temple that year.
Other temples too can start the practice of distributing saplings instead of prasad during this rainy season.
Today India has to spend billions and trillions of rupees to import timber wood from abroad for construction of houses and furniture.
If we plant on the boundaries of our fields timber trees that can be utilised for construction of homes and furniture and which can also be cut and sold after 15 to 20 years with the permission of the government.
Some days ago, a few states taking advantage of this weather have started many campaigns in this direction and the Government of India has also passed CAMPA law, under which about 40 thousand crores rupees will go to the states for planting trees.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government planted about 2 crores sapling in the entire state on 1st July and next year they have taken a pledge to plant about 3 crores trees.
Rajasthan, desert area, has celebrated Van Mahotsav in a very big way and pledged to plant 25 lakhs trees.
To plant 25 lakhs of sapling in Rajasthan is not a small matter
Those who know the soil conditions of Rajasthan would know how mammoth this task is going to be.
Andhra Pradesh, too has decided to increase its green cover by 50 by the year 2029.
Under the central governments ongoing Green India Mission, Railways too have joined in this endeavour.
Gujarat too has an illustrious tradition of observing Van Mahotsav.
But for me the visit to South Africa was more like a pilgrimage.
When we think of South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever we hear the words non-violence, love and forgiveness, the inspiring faces of Gandhi and Mandela appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I visited Phoenix settlement where Mahatma Gandhis home is known as Sarvodaya.
I had the privilege of meeting these grat personalities, these close associates of Nelson Mandela such as Shriman Ahmed Kathrada, Shriman Laloo Chiba, Shriman George Bizos and Ronnie Kasrils.
We all want a good future for our children.
My dear countrymen, I have received a message from Shilpi Varma, to whom I am grateful.
Some days ago, I read in a news article that a lady became a victim of fraud and cheat email, lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide.
Being a woman, I feel an empathy with her family.
What is your opinion about such cheat and fraud emails.
She has pointed a certain incident, and you must also be aware that we get messages on our mobile phones and emails, proclaiming attractive offers that you have won a jackpot of so many rupees
You too must be getting similarly confused sometimes
They use fake letter pads while sending these letters.
They obtain your credit card number and debit card number and empty your bank account through technology.
Shilpi Varma has brought this important thing to my notice, which although even you must have encountered, but may be you did not take it that seriously, but I feel there is need to look at it seriously.
My dear countrymen these days, the Parliament Session is going on, and during the Parliament Session, I get to meet many people from across our nation.
Our MPs also bring people from their constituencies and introduce them to me
Student from Aligarh had come to meet me.
You should have seen the enthusiasm of those boys and girls.
They showed me the pictures of how they had beautified the Aligarh railway station
These were artistic painting done on the station.
And by creating this vertical garden on the site of railway station, they have given it a new look.
If you go to Aligarh, do visit the railway station.
I am receiving news from many railway stations in the country where the local populace has taken to depicting on the walls of the railway stations, their areas identity, through means of their arts.
I felicitate all such citizens involved in these kinds of activities and especially congratulate friends from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, with the onset of rainy season, there is also an onset of festival season in our country.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a festival of special significance.
Just like last year, cant you gift on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojna to mothers and sisters of our country.
this is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
And I am the first Prime Minister of this nation who was born in free India.
I hope that you too become inspired with the spirit of patriotism and do something good in that vein.
You too must be having certain thoughts that you wish were proclaimed from Red Fort.
I invite you to write to me about your thoughts that I, as your representative, as your Pradhan Sevak should talk about from the Red Fort.
Once again I have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart, through Mann Ki Baat.
For me, Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of ritual
I myself am very eager to talk to you.
And I am really happy that I am able to connect with you all in every corner of India, through this programme Mann Ki Baat.
I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in regional languages at 8 pm.
I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with peoples participation.
The summer heat is increasing day by day.
And in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week, which has added to the worry.
Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat.
The mercury continues to soar.
Be it animals, birds or humans...
everyone is suffering.
These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation.
Forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees.
In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.
This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme ero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade.
As per the conventional Government precedent, I could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states, but I chose not to do so.
I had a one-on-one meeting with each state, devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one.
I carefully heard what each state had to say.
Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state.
Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings.
And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology.
I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also.
Peoples participation is a strong base for solving such problems.
We not only pick it up but also pray five times for Gods forgiveness.
Water is also an offering form the God.
And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance.
And so there is need for implementing the maxim Per Drop More Crop through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake.
At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers.
And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation.
Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through Mission Bhagirathi have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers.
In Andhra Pradesh, Neeru Pragati Mission has been using technology for ground water recharging.
Chhattisgarh has started the Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj campaign.
In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water.
Rajasthan has started the Chief Ministers Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan Water Self Sufficiency Campaign.
Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem.
This concerns everybody the villages, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban people, the country folk, the rich and the poor.
And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save how much water we stopped from flowing out.
You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold.
Water has this power, no matter how tired one is, just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed.
No matter how tired we are
Just connect to it with your heart. Conserve it
We should harvest water.
We should also store water.
We should also modernise water irrigation.
This I say as an earnest appeal.
We should not let this season go waste.
The coming four months should be transformed into a Save the Water Campaign, to save every drop of water.
And this is not just for the governments, not just for the politicians, it is a work to be carried out by the people at large.
Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail.
I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever
I invite then as well.
So we will have to change some of our old habits as well.
Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction.
We all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins, no currency notes
If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange.
The whole world is moving towards a cashless society.
Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money
And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket.
We need not worry about keeping an account
the account will be maintained automatically.
In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us.
And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened.
In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card.
There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it
there is no need to carry around any cash with you.
The second endeavour we have started is Bank on Mobile. The Universal Payment Interface banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work.
It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone.
If this happens, perhaps you may not even need to carry a RuPay card with you.
Across the country, nearly 1.
25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents.
But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.
How is the food
This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.
Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations.
We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.
But I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought.
Ive received one email on MyGov.
in site, which drew my attention. One Mr.
Gaurav, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh writes that in the M.
I dont know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.
Then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more.
I would like to urge guardians, parents and people all around, to please accept, welcome and express your satisfaction over your childrens results, and motivate them to surge ahead in life.
Else, it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100 marks and you will say that, you have got 100 percent
But still, had you done something more, it would have been better
He says that the people around him just dont accept the results.
I dont remember the complete poem.
The poet had written something like this I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life.
And when it was exhibited, almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up. Someone said, yellow here would have been better in place of blue.
But nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture
But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new.
The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success.
And this happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor.
There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley.
Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease.
The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness.
And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is the International Day for Yog.
To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life.
21st June, International Yog Day is not just a mere event.
And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration.
These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individuals life.
Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June.
Can we make use of 21st June to bring Yog into our lives
I will be going this time to Chandigarh to participate in the programme on 21st June.
I shall be doing Yog with the people of Chandigarh.
You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day.
Okay
Thank You.
Namaste
Its summer.
Everybody makes plans for their summer holidays.
Since this is the season of mangoes, we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit.
Sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice.
But this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody.
It is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat.
On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected.
Sometimes due to encroachment, sometimes due to silting, the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked.
As a result, the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity.
To cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis, governments are making efforts.
But thats not all.
I have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation.
Awareness is now seen in many villages.
Only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water.
I was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue.
One can find many villages where there is a desire to store water.
At Hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern.
They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana.
It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so.
What a big collective decision this must have been
If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be.
But see the sensibility of these farmer brothers.
When they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water, they went ahead and did it.
Instead of sugarcane, they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water.
Farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers, drip irrigation techniques, water harvesting and water recharging, that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face.
I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages.
I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.
I was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds.
They have already created 27 farm ponds.
This panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent.
Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing.
World over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for GDP growth.
If we look around us, we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative.
This time why cant we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields
If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase.
Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches
Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive.
The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people.
So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness.
We shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing.
We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort.
We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution.
Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains.
At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it.
All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river.
I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day.
The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end.
All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, Sir, will Ganga be cleaned
It happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of India.
They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy.
The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India.
so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages, we shall continue to get the desired results.
Sharmila Dharpure from Mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call.
Sound byte-Mr.
Prime Minister Namaskar.
I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai.
Sharmilaji, your concern is quite genuine.
Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education.
And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself.
Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system.
Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education.
in, others have written to me on NarendraModiApp.
Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Mona Karnwal from Bijnore.
They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development.
It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra.
I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this.
I felt the need for greater coordination.
They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results.
Children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective.
I did get the benefit of that in my childhood.
I believe that we should infuse a new life, a new force into these organizations.
This time I put some issues before them.
We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts.
Today, I appeal to you all as well.
Please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations.
Do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes
If you write to me on my NarendraModiApp , I will send them to the right place.
After this meeting, I feel they are going to gain a new momentum.
Now even you will wish to join one of them.
Crores of rupees would be spent on these committees.
But the matter would remain at a standstill.
This has been everybodys experience.
No one ever thought beyond this.
Today, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this.
One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders.
These one crore are not wealthy families.
These are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy.
Now look at the other, rather unique, side of it.
They could have given up their subsidy through the App on their mobile, going online or by giving a missed call over the telephone.
I would like to salute those one crore families.
This has also forced the economists of the country to think differently.
We should move in this direction.
I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews.
Sometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker.
We can undertake several such experiments.
Once we place faith and trust in the people of India, we can get incomparable results.
Anyway, these are just some personal thoughts.
A person called Ravi has written to me Good News Everyday he writes please ask your officials to post about one good incident every day.
Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every breaking news.
Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people
Please change this situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his anger but I think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions.
You may remember that the former President of India, Dr A.
P.
Abdul Kalam, used to always say, Please print only positive news on the front page of the newspaper.
These days I have noticed that some T.
If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled.
You all must be aware that the government has started a website,transforming india.
We all should strive together to do something positive, talk about something positive, to spread something positive.
Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival.
I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion.
I believe that even if the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual occasion, we can turn it into a social occasion.
My dear fellow citizens, I will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of Panchayati Raj Divas today.
My heartiest thanks to you all.
As always, the unshakeable bond between your inner thoughts and those of mine gives me immense pleasure.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
As usual, you and I eagerly keep waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen that people in large numbers have shared a lot of information on a variety of books.
It is heartwarming to see them discuss books published on subjects such as Science, Technology, innovation, history, culture, business, life-sketches and so on.
Some have advised me to dwell upon many other books.
I shall discuss with you on other books as well.
But I must candidly admit here that I am not able to devote much time to reading books these days.
But I have gained a lot, in the sense that based on your correspondence here, I got opportunities to know about the themes of many kinds of books.
But the experience over the last one month makes me feel that we need to take it forward.
Why dont we create a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App, so that, whenever we read a book, we write about it and discuss it on this platform
And you can even suggest an apt name for our book corner.
I want this book corner to be an active forum for readers writers alike.
So keep reading writing sharing with all friends of Mann Ki Baat alongside.
I specially congratulate the Haryana Government for establishing a connect with the farmers to wean them away from conventional modes of farming towards crops that do not require much water.
Why dont we use these fairs to spread the message of water conservation
All sections of society turn up in fairs in large numbers.
They are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguli Hrithik Alaamandaa.
What I tell you about them will fill your hearts with pride verve as well.
All of us know that just the word CANCER is more than enough to scare the world.
It conjures images of Death waiting at the doorstep. But each of these Ten children, not only fought against the dreaded disease cancer in their battle of life, but also brought glory laurels to the country.
In sports and games, we often get to see a player becoming a champion after winning a tournament or bagging a medal
this was a rare occasion when the participants were champions BEFORE they entered the contest...
they were champions of LIFE, the battle.
In this tournament, sports games such as shooting, chess, swimming, running, football table-tennis are organized.
All Ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Out of these, some players even won more than one medal.
People from across the country, such as Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
In fact, in the realms of Space, 2019 has been a very fruitful year for India.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March.
Whereas the fact is, through the A-Sat, we have acquired the capability of destroying a satellite three hundred Kilometres away in a mere three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world, possessing this capacity.
And now, on the 22nd of July, the nation watched with pride Chandrayaan II taking strides into space from Sriharikota.
Visuals of Chandrayaan II lifting off filled our countrymens hearts with glory, zest and joy.
We should trust our talents capacities we should have faith in them.
We are now expectantly waiting for the month of September, when Lander Vikram Rover Pragyan will land on Lunar surface.
Through Mann Ki Baat today, I wish to share with students, my young friends, information on a very interesting competition ...
I invite young boys girls to a uiz Competition.
Your inquisitiveness regarding Space, Indias Space Mission, Science and Technology will be the salient features of this uiz Competition.
I urge my young friends, students to participate in this competition and make it interesting and memorable through their participation.
I specially call upon schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers mentors to strive hard to ensure victory for their respective schools.
There in September they will get an opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan would be landing on the surface of the Moon.
For these winners, it will be a historic event of their life.
So, let us not forget to participate in the uiz...
let us encourage inspire as many friends fellow students to do the same.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our chain of Mann Ki Baat has lent pace to the cleanliness campaign from time to time.
Similarly, efforts towards ensuring cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
A journey that began five years ago gathered momentum with mass participation is now setting up newer benchmarks in cleanliness sanitation.
It is not that we have reached the ideal yet, but the way we have achieved success in ODF clean public spaces, it displays the collective will strength of the resolve of a hundred thirty crore countrymen.
But we are not stopping at that.
This movement has now advanced from cleanliness towards beautification.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team on the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
Recently, he has picked up the gauntlet to not just clean up Delhi, but to beautify it.
With his team, he began with the garbage bins of Lodi Garden.
Through the medium of street art, he has decorated many localities of Delhi with aesthetically appealing paintings.
From over bridges to school walls to hutments he gave a free hand to his talent, garnering huge public support on the way, on the lines of an effective campaign.
Remember how, during the Kumbh, Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings
We experience this in the beauty, the aesthetics of the Swachchata Abhiyan.
This comment came from Brother Muhammad Aslam who stays in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote, I like listening to the programme Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to let you know that I played a positive active role in organizing the community mobilisation programme- Back to Village in my state Jammu Kashmir.
Simultaneously, there should be a provision for online monitoring too.
This week long programme encompassing about 4500 panchayats witnessed the govt. officials briefing the villagers about the schemes and programmes implemented by the Government and also inquired whether these facilities were available to them or not.
How to impart more might to the Panchayats
How to increase their income
Literacy, sex ratio, health, hygiene, water conservation, electricity, water, Girl education, senior citizens concerns etc.
Many sports competitions for kids were organized under the aegis of Khelo India.
Sports Kits, MNREGA job cards and SCST certificates were distributed.
There were Financial Literacy camps and Agriculture and Horticulture Department set up stalls where knowledge about govt.
The people of Kashmir open heartedly became equal stakeholders in this festival.
Whenever we look around us in this season it appears as if earth has draped itself in a sheet of greenery
It is during this season that the festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizing the bond between a brother and sister also falls.
While we are talking of the month of sawan, you will be glad to learn that the number of pilgrims in the Amarnath Yatra this year has been the greatest in the past 4 years.
A total of 3 lakh pilgrims have had the darshan of the holy Amarnath shrine from 1st July till now.
In 2015, the number of devotees who performed this pilgrimage over 60 days has been crossed over by the number of pilgrims in mere 28 days this year
I would especially like to thank the hospitality of the people of Jammu- Kashmir while referring to successful organization of Amarnath Yatra.
I have been told that within a span of a month- and- a half of the commencement of Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have had the darshan of Kedarnath Shrine.
This is a record number of pilgrims post the apocalyptic events of 2013.
I appeal to all of you to visit those tourist spots within our country whose scenic beauty is to behold during the monsoon.
There are no better ways to witness this nations beauty and peoples sentiments and no better teachers than tourism and pilgrimage.
On the other hand, heavy rainfall in many parts of the country has resulted in countrymen suffering due to floods.
Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter.
I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.
Some of my young friends must be busy with their examinations.
For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other.
I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.
Some days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup.
Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.
With the young comprising 65 of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports.
This wont do.
We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports.
We can see that happening in India.
As with Cricket, theres now increasing interest in Football, Hockey, Tennis, and Kabaddi.
You must have come to know that India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country.
The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics.
Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs.
Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.
On the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches.
Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television.
What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility
Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports
We should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India.
Our youth, the children in our schools, should be drenched in sweat just playing Football.
If that happens, we shall have real fun playing the host.
So, all of us should make the effort to ensure Football reaches every village, street and alley.
Between now and the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017, we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth.
One advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities.
But I personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game.
How can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup
How can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments, educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game
We can see all this happening in relation to cricket
we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well.
I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of Indias youth power not in the sense of winning or losing a match.
In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths
while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.
I look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp.
What should the songs be like
What should be in the souvenirs
Think about it friends.
I would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
You should robustly participate in this event.
Its a golden chance to build Indias image.
My dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays.
There are very few people who go abroad
We have to take this task forward.
Do it this time as well.
Someone has rightly said that A traveller without observation is a bird without wings.
If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.
Travel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives.
These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity.
Unlike before, they dont want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track.
They want to do something new, see something new.
When we see pictures of miners, we wonder what it must be like out there.
But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism.
This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur.
This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.
I hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too.
Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done.
But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world.
We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side.
Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India.
Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens we all have to come together to make this happen.
Come, lets make an endeavour in this direction.
My dear young friends, I dont like it when holidays are just frittered away.
If you dont know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays
If you dont know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays
Or you could tell yourself, I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldnt I learn proper way of typing
There are so many skills to develop our personality.
Why not learn them
Do give it a thought.
It is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this.
You can find something around you.
You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill.
He called me up and reminded me of what I had said.
He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me.
Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends.
The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds.
Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do.
I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.
Shilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term Digital India.
Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities.
No, its not like that.
You will be happy to learn that a Kisan Suvidha App has been launched to serve your interests.
If you download this Kisan Suvidha App on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips.
There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts.
If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it
they will explain things to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
Why dont you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you
If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.
A farmer waits for the rains.
We will have to give a thought to what will happen if theres no water.
Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted.
Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected
If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced.
But this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water.
You must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs.
But we still need to do much more in this direction.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, Farmers Fair.
There should be a balance in everything.
This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money.
Our stand is clear: Less Cost, More Output. Invest Less and Reap More.
We should move forward with this mantra and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods.
This year the theme of the World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics.
Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths.
Diabetes is of two types Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes.
Physical labour is getting reduced.
There is not a trace of sweat
Can we not, drawing inspiration from this years World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life
If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga.
Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run.
If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy.
On March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day.
When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB.
It would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease.
But now we are not scared of it because everybody knows TB is curable and can be easily cured.
Tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot.
There are more than 13,500 Microscopy Centres, more than four lakh DOTS providers, various advanced laboratories.
And all these services are free.
Please go and get a check-up done.
This disease can be got rid of.
All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely.
My dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
London, where he was educated, Nagpur, where he had his Deeksha 26, Alipur Road, Delhi, where his soul left him for its heavenly abode and the cremation ground in Mumbai where his last rites were performed.
We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots.
I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens.
We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.
In a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin.
It is celebrated in different states in different forms.
You can listen to it on your own mobile handset.
All you have to do is to give a missed call.
I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it.
You too can note down the number.
I will be happy to remain connected with you.
Friends, I would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup to our advantage.
How should this event be
The FIFA event offers us a unique opportunity to do so.
Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.
I see this as a good sign.
They should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before.
In this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India.
India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world.
You too should think along these lines.
I will give you something to ponder upon.
You will enjoy it.
I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat.
Frankly, I had forgotten about it.
But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.
I hope we will do, with full concentration, whatever is necessary for water conservation.
Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it.
Please do be concerned about this.
Oh look
Go get it checked. You must have got TB.
This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.
But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you dont do something about it.
That must be playing on your mind.
I wish to be a part of this journey along with you.
I am concerned about your childrens exams as much as you are, but I am not worried.
If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.
When I shared my inner thoughts with you during last months Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App.
Today, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers.
I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now.
Wherever you go, you will be asked How are the preparations going
How many marks are you likely to score
I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself.
When I used to play cricket, there were a lot of expectations from me as well.
As time passed, their expectations kept growing.
So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this.
If I set my own targets and I am able to achieve them, then I am sure to do something good for my country.
And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself.
My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own.
Good luck
It is you who have to shape your own future.
I am sure that what Sachin-ji has said will prove very helpful for you.
Why dont we compete with ourselves
dont get trapped in this score-keeping.
You should think of a greater purpose in life.
You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to.
So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience.
Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only.
In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.
I agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise ones preparation.
One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time.
I hope you will not do that.
I am sure you wont do anything like that.
Discipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives.
A strong foundation comes from discipline.
Those who are un-organized and undisciplined, do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night.
Not just that, our entire routine collapses.
So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant.
Dont get into this mess.
Do things the way you have planned them.
Friends, I have seen that there are two types of students.
Someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others, who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world.
He is chess champion Vishwanathan Anand and he will relate his experiences.
Come, why dont you learn how to checkmate in exams from him
Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand.
I will next talk a little bit about how I went to my exams and my experiences for that.
I found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life.
So if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well, then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment.
So stay calm.
At the last minute, just go over the most important things and the things you feel, the topics you feel, you dont remember very well.
Vishwanathan Anand has really said something very important.
You must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments, he sits with such a healthy composure.
We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird.
Just imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom.
Would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before
If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen.
Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand.
This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.
Rajat Agarwal has told us something good.
He wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed.
If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw.
From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world.
Our revered Murari Bapu has sent some important tips for students.
He is a teacher and a thinker, and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both.
And even if you are not successful, you will not have any remorse.
Nor will you be arrogant of your success.
I would like to conclude my message with a couplet It cannot be that one succeeds each time.
Learn to also live with failures.
I felicitate this program Mann ki Baat presented by our honorable Prime Minister and my best wishes to all.
I am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.
And this is a matter of joy to me.
Its nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for Yoga, so much curiosity has developed for Yoga.
Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair.
It is one of the simplest keys
you must pay more attention to it.
See if you can do it.
But why should you do these things in a hurry.
You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss.
When we dont understand the questions, thats when we sometimes find them difficult.
That too competitive examinations.
Do not worry, do your best.
Thats what I tell all my young friends.
At the same time remember, that there are many opportunities in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life and dont give it up.
You will succeed.
Do not forget that you are a child of the universe.
You have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains.
All you need is doggedness, dedication and tenacity.
With these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours.
I wish you luck in everything you want to do.
God Bless.
See the style of talking that a scientist has
What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses.
I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country.
If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid.
And a golden future awaits you for doing well.
Ruchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience.
She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well.
There are many things that inspire us, and dont think that they inspire only students.
We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison.
This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.
Who doesnt know of Srinivas Ramanujam, one of the greatest names among modern Indian mathematicians
Do you know that he had no formal education in Mathematics
The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide.
Exams are not just for the students, they also put the students families, schools and teachers to test.
Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance.
Vijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations.
Today, I dont want to say much to the parents.
Please dont create any pressure for your children.
If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please dont stop them.
I say all this because, friends, today is National Science Day, the festival of science in this country.
Every year this day is observed on 28th February.
On 28th February 1928, Sir C.
V.
Raman had declared his discovery of the Raman Effect.
This was the discovery for which he received the Nobel Prize.
And so the nation celebrates this day as National Science Day.
Each generation should lay stress on innovation.
And innovation is not possible without science and technology.
Today on National Science Day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance.
Science, knowledge, technology... all these things should be a part of our journey to development.
This year the theme for National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations.
I humbly pay my homage to Sir C.
But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics.
It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind.
But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it.
I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward
My dear fellow citizens, in the last few days we have taken an important decision.
To gain more success about this discovery, the Government of India has decided to install a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, in short it is called LIGO, here in India.
This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world.
India is going to be the third.
I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.
From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat.
You can even listen to it in your mother tongue.
The number to give a missed call on is 81908-81908.
I repeat 81908-81908.
I have to take an exam tomorrow.
125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam.
You know it, dont you
Tomorrow is Budget Day.
But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2016
Fellow citizens, Namaskar to all .
This will be the last edition of Mann ki Baat in 2015.
The next edition of Mann ki Baat will be in 2016.
India is land of diversities.
It becomes a source of the economic activities for even the poor sections of the society.
Greetings from my end for a Merry Christmas to all Indians and I also wish you all a Happy New Year.
You are aware that I use a lot of technology which provides me lots of information.
A large number of foreign and domestic tourists travel across the country. People also travel to celebrate Christmas vacations.
Dileep Singh Malviya is an elderly artisan from Bhojpura village in Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh.
And hats off to him, he has constructed 100 toilets in Bhojpura village so far taking it as a divine cause and providing his labour services without charging a penny.
My heartfelt congratulations to Dileep Singh Malviya for his earnest efforts.
Sometimes we hear disappointing news about our nation.
This is the power of the nation.
This is the hope of the nation and these are the things which carry the nation forward and it is natural that we applaud Dilip Singh and his efforts in Mann ki Baat.
The Yoga incident was a similar reminder.
The concept of cleanliness is being echoed in every household.
The media has not discussed this topic.
But I am sure that media will definitely reach such villages and will inform the nation about the happiness and excitement of the people there.
The biggest achievement of this task is that the government officials involved in this task will have immense satisfaction that they have done something which will bring about such a big change in the lives of the people and the village itself.
We should all make efforts that right information, good information and information useful to the common man should reach as many people as possible.
This is also a kind of service.
But if I am saying then I should at least do something.
Even a common man can download the Narendra Modi App and get connected to me.
And I can share these small things with you through the app.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that people share all the things with me.
You too get connected with this initiative, we have to reach 125 crore Indians.
How will I reach without your help
Come, let us collectively do such things of interest for the common man in their language and inspire them to avail things which are their rights.
Can our states work together for new Start-ups for youth, and encourage innovations with start-ups, be it in the manufacturing sector, service sector or agriculture.
Everything should be new, new ways and new thinking - after all the world does not move ahead without innovation.
Start-up India, Stand-up India brings in a huge opportunity for the young generation.
My dear young friends, the government will launch the entire action plan for Start-up India, Stand-up India on 16th January.
There is an established thinking regarding the Start-ups that they are meant only for the digital world or the IT profession.
This thinking is wrong.
The Indian youth all over the country has talent, all they need is opportunities.
I will definitely interact with you on 16th January and will discuss this in detail.
Your suggestions are always welcome.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are thousands like me who draw inspiration from him.
Since 1995, 12th January, the birth Anniversary of Vivekananda is celebrated as the National Youth Festival.
This year it will be organized from 12-16th January in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh.
Dilip Chauhan, from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, who is a visually challenged teacher celebrated Accessible India Day in his school.
He called me up to express his feelings: Sir, we celebrated Accessible India Campaign in our school.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
At some point we heard handicapped, then it was disabled and somewhere it is specially-abled, so many terms have been used.
It is true that words have their own significance.
So I thought why not use the term Divyang instead of viklang in our country.
They are those people who have one or more such organs which have divinity, where divine power flows which we normal bodied people do not have.
Under this campaign we will improve both the physical and virtual infrastructure and make it accessible for the Divyang people. Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations, everywhere ramps, accessible parking, accessible lifts, Braille, many amenities will be made available.
They should not have a dead existence in government files.
After all, these schemes are meant for common man, the poor people.
If this subsidy reached people on time or not
The Government has made some changes in the scheme.
The government undertook the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of Jan Dhan Account or Aadhar Card etc.
I am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in Guinness Book of World Records as the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme which has been implemented successfully.
This scheme is known as Pehel and this experiment has been very successful.
On one hand was the Aadhar Card Scheme, and on the other was the Jan Dhan Account. Thirdly the state and Indian government compiled the lists of beneficiaries.
That was connected to account and Aadhar. This work is still in progress.
Till now around 40,000 crore rupees are directly reaching the beneficiaries through various schemes.
According to my rough estimate, around 35-40 schemes are now under Direct Benefit Transfer.
This is a beautiful co-incidence that Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the maker of the Indian Constitution, his 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated this year.
We organized a two day special discussion on the constitution and it was a very good experience.
I have An iidea Send me an essay or poem before 26th January about duty in Hindi or English or your native language. Can you send me
I want to know your views.
Send them on my portal My Gov.
I would like to know what my young generation thinks about their duties.
The new trades and jobs would have commenced with renewed vigour.
On the other hand Christmas preparations must have started too.
Festivals have their own significance in social life.
Sometimes festivities help to heal wounds and sometimes they are source of renewed energy.
In our country itself, we have experienced torrential rains, that too without season and for a very long duration.
Tamil Nadu has suffered heavy losses and other states suffered too.
But today, its form and format has changed.
It has become important to work on our capacity building at every level.
The government, civil society, the citizens, and the small organizations will all have to work for capacity building through scientific temperament.
After the Nepal earthquake I talked to Pakistans Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I suggested that the SAARC nations should come together for a joint exercise on disaster preparedness.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am happy to hear your message.
Your concerns are right but this just does not happen in Punjab and Haryana alone.
But the concern you have expressed is genuine.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are themselves very valuable.
So it can be used not only to feed the animals, and save our land but also to create good fertilizer.
If this is added to the soil, it will be doubly beneficial.
Once I had the opportunity of talking to farmers involved in Banana cultivation.
And they shared a very good experience.
Earlier as they cultivated banana, when the crop was over, the stumps of the tree would remain.
To clear the stumps from the fields they had to spend 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 rupees per hectare.
Dear countrymen, the entire world will remember 3rd December as International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Last time in Mann ki Baat I talked about organ donation.
I talked about the NOTO helpline for Organ donation.
Organ Donation can save many valuable lives.
Organ donation can bring about immortality.
Like I said earlier, 3rd December is being celebrated as International Day of People with Disability.
Today, I want to talk about Javed Ahmed.
He is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, the terrorists had shot Jawed Ahmed in Kashmir.
But the bullet damaged his kidney and a part of the intestine was lost.
He suffered serious spinal injury.
How to develop systems for the disabled in government offices and public spaces
He is working on those issues.
He turned the focus of his educational qualification in those areas.
There is some truth to it.
In the past, the Orissa government especially facilitated an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
She would reach out to every household to use mosquito repellent and mosquito nets.
She fought with Malaria and prepared the entire village to fight against it.
My dear young friends, who are especially active on the internet and the social media, I want to inform that I have kept 3 e-books on mygov. in.
These e-books are about inspiring stories of Swatch Bharat, health sector and the Sansad Aadarsh Gram Yojana.
Please do send it to Mygov.
D bulb usage.
I had once mentioned to switch off the street lights on a full moon night and enjoy the moonlight for an hour.
The actual credit goes to ee News because the link was of ee News.
There is a woman Noor Jahan in Kanpur.
Watching her on television it seemed that she did not have much of a chance to get education.
But she is doing something which no one would have thought of.
She is utilizing the Solar Energy of the Sun to illuminate the houses of the poor.
She is fighting darkness and bringing light to her own name.
People take the lanterns in the evening and return them in the mornings for recharging.
I have heard that people in large numbers around 500 people are using these lanterns.
3-4 per day the entire house is illuminated.
Noor Jehan works the entire day to recharge the lanterns in the solar energy plant.
I congratulate Noor Jehan and ee TV that they presented this effort which was going on in a remote corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Many congratulations to you.
I received a phone call from Mr. Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Uttar Pradesh.
I am Abhishek Kumar Pandey calling from Gorakhpur.
I want to congratulate the Prime Minister for starting a programme MUDRA bank.
You sent me a message from Gorakhpur.
The Prime Minister MUDRA fund is about funding the unfunded.
MUDRA is meant to encourage enterprise
it is about creating earning opportunities.
MUDRA will empower in the truest sense.
It is meant to help the small scale enterprises.
This initiative is yet to achieve the speed that I have aimed for.
But the start has been good.
Till now 66 lakh people have received 42,000 crore rupees through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Abhishek has himself narrated his excitement.
I too keep receiving various news.
Someone just told me that there is one Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
I had told about my cleanliness campaign that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhonsle proved it.
This is our intention behind the MUDRA scheme.
I have been told about Mamta Sharma from Bhopal. She received Rs 40,000 from the MUDRA Yojana.
She is into the business of making purses.
But earlier she would borrow money at high rates and barely manage her business.
Now that she has a large sum of money in her hand, her work is going on smoothly.
Earlier the money that was lost in paying high interest and for other reasons could now be saved.
She was able to save around 1000 rupees every month.
The familys new enterprise started developing.
But I want that this scheme is promoted more.
Our banks should become more sensitized and should help more and more people.
We want to strengthen these people.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October on the Anniversary of Sardar Patel I had discussed about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India).
Conducting such events creates continuous awareness in social life.
Rashtram Jagryam Vyayam: means internal vigilance is the prize of liberty.
This tradition should be followed for national unity.
I have been told that many suggestions have been received.
But I am expecting more suggestions.
I expect more specific schemes.
I have been told that the participants will all receive a certificate.
Many big prizes have been announced.
You also utilize your creative mind.
It should be grand and full of life.
I have complete faith that your ideas will be really useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winters are about to start.
I request you to utilize this good season for some kind of physical activity and exercise.
So make a good habit in this good season.
My good wishes again to all my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind
Namaskar to all my fellow citizens
This series has been named as the Gandhi-Mandela series.
I started the Mann ki Baat and people started connecting with it.
I would like to talk about Kerala again.
The girl students from Saint Mary Upper primary School from Chittoor in Kerala have sent me a letter.
They have sent me the image of mother India.
Initially I was surprised to see why they created a map of India using thumb prints.
But when I read their letter, I realized how beautifully a symbolic message was given.
It is not as if these girls have tried to just awaken the Prime Minister alone.
Organ donation should become a habit as well as an instinct.
They have asked me in their letter to appeal to people about Organ Donation in Mann ki Baat.
The octogenarian Vasantrao Sudke Guru ji from Maharashtra has been running a movement from a long time.
He says that organ donation should be a celebrated as a festival.
These days I get a lot of messages on phone calls also.
Devesh from Delhi gas also sent me a similar message.
However in a country with 125 crore people, only 5000 transplants could take place.
Each year about one lakh eyes are in need of a vision.
And we are able to reach upto only 25,000 people who need it .
It implies that we are able to provide eye transplant services to only one out of the four needy persons.
We should also know that if someone is killed in a road accident, then also the organs can be donated.
There are some legal hassles involved.
National Organ and Tissue transplant Organization (NOTO) has been established to encourage organ transplant. A 24x7 helpline facility is also available.
Its number is 1800 114 770.
And there is a saying Tain Tyakten Bhunjhita ("What is given by Him, allotted to you, you enjoy that").
The joy of sacrifice is beautifully described in this mantra Tain Tyakten Bhunjhita.
In the past few days we saw on television that the wife of a poor hawker in Delhi received a transplant in Delhis G.
Dear countrymen, we recently celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
We celebrated Eid and Ganesh Chaturthi too.
For the first time a program of this scale is being organized on the Indian soil.
Leaders of 54 African countries and unions have been invited.
This is the biggest conference of African countries outside Africa.
If both are combined together they make for a third of the world population.
More than 25,000 African youths have studied human resource development and capacity building in India.
And many leaders from Africa have studied in India.
So you can understand the depth of our relationship.
And from that perspective this summit is very important.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the HRD ministry has done something really commendable.
Lakhs of school children enjoyed this exhibition.
The villagers also had a glimpse.
People realized the importance of the role of Mahatma Gandhi in developing the ties of both India and Africa and also the effect of his personality on these nations.
Since then, many parliamentarian friends have adopted it.
They were deeply involved.
Last month a workshop was organized in Bhopal.
All the pradhans, collectors, parliamentarians of villages adopted under Adarsh Gram, the representatives of Indian government and state government, all had an in-depth discussion on this program.
Unfortunately whenever one talks of Jharkhand what comes to mind is Maoism, violence, guns and blood soaked land.
Many regions in the state have been ruined by these communist terrorists.
He encouraged the officials to visit.
I would like to congratulate our Honourable parliamentarian Sri Karia Munda ji for the same.
I got similar information from Andhra too.
L Ruwala ji, he is an MP from Mizoram, our North East.
He chose Khwalahilung village for Adarsh Gram and ran a special initiative.
Sri Ruwala ji started a Sugarcane Festival on 11th March.
I congratulate Ruwala ji for his efforts to make this village not only an Adarsh gram but self dependent village too.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is not possible that there be an episode of Mann ki Baat and we do not discuss cleanliness.
Savita Rai from Mumbai has sent me a telephonic message - each year on Diwali we clean our houses.
This Diwali let us clean our environment along with our homes and maintain that cleanliness even after Diwali.
As a result of it, soon after Diwali a cleanliness drive got initiated all by itself.
So what you are saying is true that our concern before and after the festival should be the same.
And we should express this concern on every public platform.
And today, I especially congratulate all the members of the Indian media fraternity.
This 2nd October, on Gandhi jis anniversary and also on the completion of one year of Clean India Campaign, I had the fortune of participating in the Safaigiri Campaign of the India today group.
They gave away the Clean India Awards and I could see several initiatives being carried out.
Different people were working as One Like, One Mission.
There are so many places in our country that have been kept so clean.
All these things were brought to light and I offered my heartfelt appreciation to India Today group for their commendable efforts.
He has been successful in bringing together around 51 lakh children from 55-56 thousand schools of Andhra and Telangana to this mission.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks or other places, he ran a cleanliness drive.
All these news exhibit the power to realize the dream of a Clean India.
This is why, Savita Rai ji, the suggestion that you have given us the whole nation has taken it upon them to do this work and taking it forward.
He has also mentioned that a few years ago they also got the award for the cleanest village of Asia.
The idea of a far-flung village situated in the north-eastern region in Meghalaya, which has been particular about cleanliness since years, makes me extremely happy.
My dear countrymen, I said this from the Red Fort on the 15th of August that there are few places where corruption is deep rooted.
When a poor man goes for an ordinary job, he faces so many problems to get a decent reference and has to go through through a team of agents who take money from him in exchange for the position he is applying for. He loses money whether he gets the job or not.
I have never heard of any psychologist in the world who can analyze a person completely in a 1-2 minute long interview.
So, let me congratulate all my young friends for the same.
We had, anyways, declared an important scheme in the last budget.
In our country, gold has become a part of our social life.
Now, when you keep your gold in the bank, the bank will give you money as interest.
Do not keep your gold in your homes.
Another thing is, in Sovereign Gold Bonds, you do not really get a physical gold in your hand.
So, we are introducing this scheme now.
Due to this scheme, we will not have to buy gold now.
In the coming week, I will certainly put forward this scheme that guarantees security to the people of this country.
I feel very glad to tell you that we are also introducing Gold Coin, a gold coin with Ashok Chakra.
Why should it not have the national emblem of our country
This is why we are introducing it in the market and it will be available for the citizens in the coming week, before Dhanteras - 5gm and 10gm of gold coins with Ashok Chakra are being introduced.
Along with it a 20 gm Gold Gunion will also be available for the people.
I have full faith that this new scheme will usher a new change in the financial development of the country and I will get your support in this.
But this mantra of unity should be a continuously present in our thoughts in our minds, behaviour and our expressions.
India is full of diversities.
Many sects, communities, languages, castes, attires, and it is this diversity that adds to its charm.
This is why diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, social harmony, unity, these are essential elements of a society.
Since last many years, Run for Unity programs have been organized in various parts of the country on the 31st of October.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, you must all be busy in the preparations for Diwali, houses must be getting cleaned.
You must be shopping for new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in various ways all over the country.
I extend my good wishes to you on this pious festival.
We also get to hear of a few accidents around the time of Diwali.
This is why I am saying that I am very excited about my Britain trip this time.
Many years ago, what Lord Vishweshwara had done for democracy and empowerment of women can make for a very good subject to study in the world.
The unveiling of the statue of Lord Vishweshwara on the land of London is in itself a perfect example of the fact that the great men of India were very far-sighted.
We should learn more than one language in a country like India.
I will try to make it reach out to you in your language.
We have formed a beautiful bond between us.
Last time I had completed a year in power.
This year we are entering a new year.
A heartfelt congratulations to all my countrymen once again
Mann Ki Baat, September 2015
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
Mann Ki Baat one year, many thoughts.
I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.
In a democracy the power of the people is of great significance.
This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people.
But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking.
Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual.
But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs.
This in itself is a great power.
these lakhs of letters did teach me something more.
It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom.
Who would have thought that the Mann Ki Baat will become a source of information
But this has happened.
In the same way Mann Ki Baat became a platform to express the power of society.
I had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens, keeping in mind the tourism industry of India to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of Incredible India so that I can also see them.
People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India.
Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage.
A simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change.
Once I had mentioned in Mann Ki Baat about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit.
The common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy.
I am happy that we received more than 55,000 calls from across the country - be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup, be it Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is no part of India from which I did not receive a phone call.
This is a pleasant experience in itself.
People of all age groups have sent messages.
I listened to some message personally and I liked them.
My team is working on the others.
The reason may be that they are not able to watch T. V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio.
This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people.
I am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message.
It is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces.
The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies.
We have completed 50 years of our war with Pakistan in 1965.
To commemorate this event an exhibition named Shouryanjali had been organized near India Gate.
I saw it with immense interest.
Whether it is the battle of Haji Pir, Chaminda or Asal Uttar and the visuals of our victory near Haji Pir, we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers.
If we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end.
This exhibition will last a few days. I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it.
And do not be in haste like me.
I came back in 2-2.
Look at the power of democracy, a young kid has ordered the Prime Minister, although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry.
On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days.
I dont get offended by all this.
I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.
Look at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
He once said, if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later.
Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.
Its the birth anniversary of Honorable Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
If we, 1. 5 billion Indians buy a handloom product or Khadi for even Rs. 5, 10 or Rs.
I wish to share this joy with you as well.
I visited Kolkata in the month of May and the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me.
His nephew Chandra Bose had organized everything.
I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash babus family members.
Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Ministers residence for a meeting.
More than that, I feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that I will get in October must be a one of a kind opportunity for the Prime Ministers residence to offer its hospitality.
More than 50 family members of Subhash babus family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting.
It is going to be a joyous moment for me.
This priceless right that I have, is it safe
I have returned from a visit to Kashi, day before yesterday.
I met a lot of people and attended a lot of events.
One of the boys, Kshitij, is a student of class 7.
He studies in the Kendriya Vidyalaya of Banaras Hindu University.
At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics.
Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things.
I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science.
Sometimes, we enjoy doing these things as well.
Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so.
I still respect your feelings.
I am thankful to you for your suggestion.
For now, we will stick to the one month program only.
Mann Ki Baat in a way has completed a year.
Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio
He started the Azad Hind Radio through a weekly news bulletin.
English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu, he used to run the radio in all these languages.
I have also completed a year since I started Mann Ki Baat.
My Mann Ki Baat has in the true sense become your Mann Ki Baat.
I speak, but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction.
Your suggestions should keep coming in.
The government gets benefited by your suggestions.
It helps to initiate improvement.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2015
I have the opportunity to be amongst you to share my Mann Ki Baat once again.
Far south, the people are engrossed in Onam festivities and yesterday the entire nation celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The government of India has launched various schemes of social security for the common man.
The preliminary information that I have, notifies me that from launch till date around 11 crore families have joined this scheme.
I offer my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on this blessed occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today when I talk to you, I want to mention that around a year back the Jan Dhan Yojana was started at a large scale.
You will be pleased to know that in this one year to connect the Banking sector, Economy and the Poor People, over 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy camps have been organized.
One just does not have to open account and get stuck.
Now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank.
These are your banks and now you should never leave them.
I have brought them to you, now it is your job to keep them going.
All of our accounts should be kept active.
I have the faith that you will definitely continue operating the bank accounts.
In the past few days the events in Gujarat, the violence unsettled the entire country.
It is natural that if something of this sort happens in the land of Mahatma and Sardar Patel, then the nation is definitely shocked and hurt.
But in a very short span of time, the intelligent brothers and sisters of mine in Gujarat brought the entire situation under control.
They played an important role in preventing the situation form worsening further and once again Gujarat started its peaceful march.
Peace, unity and brotherhood is the right way forward.
Their choice of words, their way of talking, the generosity of the Sufi tradition, its sublimity, its lyricism, I could experience it all.
I felt very nice.
I think it has become imperative to present Islam in its true form to the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide and will thus benefit not only the humanity but also benefit Islam.
And I would like to tell all that whatever faith one follows, we should definitely experience Sufism once.
I am about to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation.
Various Buddhist scholars from across the globe are coming together at Bodh Gaya and will discuss issues relating to humanity at a global level.
I have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and I am glad to be invited at Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India visited Bodh Gaya.
I have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of Mann Ki Baat.
We had issued an ordinance.
Tomorrow, on August 31st the deadline for this ordinance ends.
But in the same act, there was a job which was incomplete.
That is why I declared on 15th August that it is not just an agricultural department but an agricultural and farmer welfare department will be created. We are steadily working on it.
Do not be scared even if someone tries to scare you.
And whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also but natural that we remember his slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
It is also natural that we remember our Jawans who sacrificed their lives to maintain the pride and honour of our Tricolor Flag.
May we continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history.
Like I had the chance of meeting the Sufi scholars similarly I had another great experience.
I had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country.
How to convert these theories into machineries How to connect laboratory to the land
We have to take this forward as an opportunity.
In the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat I had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science. After this meeting I felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities.
I especially want to make a point to my young friends.
Every one rushes and that seems to be one reason for corruption at the lower levels.
Information is being disseminated and soon the decision will be enforced and small jobs will be made free of interviews.
It was the first time that this programme was organized in any other country outside America.
And it is true that in our country about 50,000 mothers and almost 13 lakh children die during delivery or immediately after it every year.
Like we became polio free similarly we became free from tetanus as a cause of maternal and child mortality.
Dear countrymen, there is news of dengue everywhere.
I would request you all that do not make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
A little carelessness about cleanliness and accumulated water can cause death, which I believe is not right.
In the entire country about 514 centers have facilities for testing dengue cases absolutely free of cost.
Like I said we may not get a chance to die for our nation, but we can be fortunate to live for the country.
These two brothers have brought pride to the nation.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth guided by a certain perception.
The old generation feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this has been going on for ages.
My experience regarding youth is different.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth we learn so many things.
I have met so many youth who have taken the pledge Sunday on Cycle.
Some say that I keep one day a week as Cycle-Day as it is good for my health.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen Namaskar.
at times our expressions would turn into an inspiration for someone close to us.
You can imagine how this period must have made one feel.
Sunday, the last Sunday, at 11 oclock, even I used to be uneasy, with a nagging feeling of a kind of emptiness...
I am sure you did.
Perhaps, this was not a lifeless programme.
It was full of liveliness, warmth and fondness. And that is why, for me the intervening period was very difficult to bear.
But this Sunday has made one wait endlessly
Over the last few months, many messages have poured in, with people stating that they have been missing Mann Ki Baat.
When I read them, when I hear them, it gives me joy.
Amidst hectic Election engagements, many people asked me a flurry of questions on why I had gone up to Kedarnath.
I can understand your curiosity...
and I too feel that my sentiments reach you.
But today, I think, if I change the course of the conversation that way, the entire complexion of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Amidst the rigours of the Election, speculations on victory or defeat, before the polling was yet to start I undertook the journey.
Most people have derived political conclusions out of that.
In a way, I undertook the journey to meet my inner self.
I shall not reveal other things today, but I certainly want to tell you that perhaps in that solitary cave, I got an opportunity to fill up the vacuum caused due to the long pause that Mann Ki Baat had to go through.
I think, someday Ill talk about that too.
WHEN, I cant say, but Ill do it for sure.
You have every right as far as I am concerned.
The way people have expressed their wish to know about Kedar, I feel a similar effort on your part to lay emphasis on positive things, which I get to know through your expressions.
There are times when some of your words act as a catalyst in sharpening my thought process.
People bring to the fore challenges facing the country and society they also come out with solutions for the same.
If someone refers to sanitation and cleanliness, he or she invariably voices angst against filth dirt, but on the same page appreciates efforts being under way to ensure cleanliness.
This means, I can closely get a fair idea of your point, in terms of extrapolating a solution to a certain problem on a society- wide scale.
Mann Ki Baatis like a mirror to the country our society.
It conveys to us that there is no dearth of inner fortitude, strength talent within our countrymen.
The need of the hour is to synergise those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities, to implement them.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that a 130 crore countrymen wish to be, strongly and actively, a part of the nations progress.
When I analyse this, you can visualise how heartening it must be for me, what a source of energy it is for me.
you brought me back, you positioned me here and gave me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this sentiment, come, lets take Mann Ki Baat forward.
There was an outrage in the conscience of one and all.
And precisely for that, the country sacrificed one full Election, not for her own sake, but for the sake of protecting democracy.
Perhaps, nowhere else in the world had citizens voted, without bothering about other rights requirements, just for the sake of saving democracy. And the country had witnessed one such Election in 77.
Just recently, our country celebrated a mega festival of democracy, a mammoth Election Campaign, from the rich to the poor, all were happily eager in this festival to decide the fate of their country.
When something is in close proximity of us, we tend to underestimate its importance we ignore even amazing facts about it.
We can think of this figure as one ordinary but if I place it in a global perspective, if you exclude China, the number of people who voted in India exceeds the population of any other country in the world.
The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha Election is more than the entire population of America, close to double the figure.
The total number of voters in India exceeds the entire population of Europe.
This stands for the sheer size spread of our Democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Election in history by far, was the largest democratic Election ever held in the world.
You can imagine the kind of resources and manpower that was required for such a mammoth exercise.
Lakhs of teachers, officers staff strived day night to make it possible.
In order to successfully conclude this Mahayagya, on the one hand, whereas close to three lakh paramilitary personnel discharged their duty on the other, 20 lakh Police personnel of various states too, persevered with due diligence.
It is on account of these people that this time voting took place on a larger scale compared to the previous Election.
For the voting, there were around 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh VVPAT machines... you can imagine the gargantuan task
All this was done, just to ensure that no voter was deprived of his or her voting rights.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, just for a lone woman voter, a polling station was created.
You will be amazed to know that it took a journey of two days for personnel of the Election Commission, just to reach there...
this is honour to democracy at its best.
The worlds highest located polling station too, is in India.
At an altitude of 15,000 feet, it is located in the Lahaul Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides this, there is another fact pertaining to these Elections, that swells our hearts with pride.
Perhaps, this is the first time ever, that women have enthusiastically voted, as much as men did.
This time the ratio of men women who voted was almost the same.
Another encouraging fact is that, today, there are a record 78 women Members of Parliament.
My dear countrymen, you may often have heard me say No bouquet, just a book
I had urged all to choose books over flowers in welcome or felicitation ceremonies.
Since then, people have been offering books at many a place.
Just recently, someone gave me a book entitled Premchand Ki Lokapriya Kahaniyan, popular short stories by Premchand.
It was a great feeling.
Of course, I couldnt get much time, but during my travelling, I got an opportunity to read some of his short stories once again.
His stories embody the collective psyche, the cumulative being of the country, of the land.
While reading one of his stories Nashaa, I couldnt help but notice the scourge of economic disparity plaguing society.
I was reminded of my younger days... how debates on this subject would carry on through entire nights
The moral of this story featuring the landholders son Eeshwari and Beer from a poor family is that if you are not careful enough, you will never know when the bane of bad company engulfs you.
The other story that touched the core of my heart was Eidgah... the sensitivity of a young lad, his unsullied love for his grandmother, such maturity at that early age
When 4-5 years old Hamid comes back to his grandma with a pair of tongs, indeed, it stirs human emotions to their supreme pinnacle.
The concluding line of this story makes one very emotional since it holds a vital truth about life, Young Hamid played the role of aged Hamid aged Ameena had turned into child Ameena.
Another such poignant story is 'Poos Ki Raat'.
In this story, the living depiction of the paradoxes in a poor farmer's life is seen.
Halku the farmer is happy even after his crops are destroyed by frost, because now he will not be forced to sleep in his fields in the cold winter.
Though these stories were written about a century ago but remain relevant all the same even today.
After reading these stories, I felt myself to be empathetic.
Now that we are conversing about reading, then in some extension of media, I had read about the Akshara Library in Kerala.
You will be surprised to learn that this library lies in a village nestling within the dense forests of Idukki.
A Primary school teacher, P.
K.
Chinnathampi who runs a small tea shop, have between them worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when the books were brought here stuffed in sacks and carried on the back.
Today this library is a beacon guiding tribal children on a new path.
The Vaanche Gujarat campaign carried out in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Participants hailing from every age group in lakhs, participated in this campaign to read books.
You will really enjoy it a lot and do write about whichever book you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat' also get to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues, which are posing a challenge not only at the present but also the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the prevailing water problem.
Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related with water.
Water is of great importance in our culture.
Rigveda's Apah Suktam says this about water: , , , , , Meaning that it is water which is the life force and also, the source of energy.
Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from rains in the entire year is harvested in our country.
Just and just 8
Now the time has come to find a solution to this problem.
I believe, like the other problems on hand, we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people, Janbhagidari and their power, Janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens.
Therefore keeping the importance of water in mind, a new Jalashakti ministry has been created in the country.
This will allow faster decision-making on all subjects related to water.
A few days ago I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans across the country.
That in order to save water, to collect water, to save the very drops of the rainwater, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and sit and discuss the resolution to this problem with the villagers.
I am happy that they have shown exemplary enthusiasm on this front and on 22nd of this month crores of people contributed free labour, Shramdaan across thousands of panchayats.
People in village after village resolved to accumulate every single drop of rainwater.
Today, I want to narrate the story of a sarpanch in the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme.
Come lets listen to what the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Katakmasandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has to say to all of us through this message:DILIP KUMAR RAVIDASThis is Birsa Munda's land, where cohabiting in harmony with nature is a part of the culture.
The people here, once again, are ready to play their active role in water conservation.
For my part I wish good luck to all the village heads and all the sarpanchs for their dynamism.
And it seems that the denizens of the villages have become involved in the competition for raising a water temple, in their respective villages.
As Ive said, a collective effort begets massive positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for dealing with water crisis across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in diverse ways.
This effort would rid of the problem of water logging.
There has been a major change through construction of small ponds in the fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about the collective endeavour in Vellore of Tamilnadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about those women of Garhwal, who are working together on the good work of implementing rainwater harvesting.
I believe that many such attempts are being made and we can turn impossible in to possible when we are together and strive with collective resolve.
My first request is that just like cleanliness drive has been given the shape of a mass movement by the countrymen, let's also start a mass movement for water conservation.
We together should all resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is God's prasad to us, water is like philosopher's stone
Let us start an awareness campaign to save even a single drop of water.
In this campaign not only should we focus on water related problems but propagate ways to save water as well.
I specifically urge the luminaries belonging to different walks of life to lead promotion of water conservation through innovative campaigns.
Whether it be from the world of films, sports, our friends in the media, people belonging to social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations or people involved in conducting devotional congregations such as Katha - Kirtan, everyone should lead this movement in their own fashion.
We must wake up the society, unite the society and join the society in this endeavour.
Youll see, we will find change occurring in front of our own eyes.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you gets an opportunity to go to Porbandar, the place of birth of revered Bapu, then there is a house behind the house of revered Bapu, where a 200-year old water tank still exists.
As I always say that whosoever visits Kirti Mandir, should also pay a visit to that Water Tank.
Come let us join water conservation, and involve ourselves in making a list of more and more innovative methods to motivate people to conserve water.
You can all share your content using the JanShakti4JalShakti hashtag.
The awareness about Holistic Health Care has enhanced the glory of yoga and Yoga day.
In any corner of the world, yoga enthusiast welcomes the sun as soon it rises and then there is the complete journey ending with sunset.
Yoga has assumed such an iconic form.
In India, over the Himalayas, across the Indian Ocean, from the lofty heights of Siachen to the depths of a Submarine, from air-force to aircraft carriers, from air-conditioned gyms to hot desert and from villages to cities - wherever possible, yoga was not just practiced everywhere, but was also celebrated collectively.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, celebrities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on the Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective nations.
On that day, the world appeared to be like one big happy family.
Therefore promotion of Yoga is a great example of social service.
Should we not recognize such service and bestow it with honour
In the year 2019, the announcement of Prime Minister's Awards for excellence in the promotion and development of yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award would be bestowed on those organizations around the world, whose significant and unique contributions in the promotion of yoga you cannot even imagine
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan', which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and conducts various training courses.
Italy's Ms.
Antonietta Rozzi, has started Sarv Yoga International, and popularized Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspirational examples in themselves.
If there is a topic related to yoga, then can Indians lag behind others
The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger dedicated to yoga from past many decades was also honoured.
The widespread celebration of Yoga and honouring those missionaries taking Yoga to the doorsteps of the common folk made this Yoga day special.
My dear countrymen, were embarking on a new journey from today armed with new emotions, new realizations, new resolve and renewed vigour. But yes
I will keep on waiting for your suggestions.
The process of linking with your thoughts through Mann Ki Baat as a medium is a very important and personal journey for myself.
Let us keep on meeting and keep on talking.
Let me keep on listening to your thoughts, let me keep on understanding and cherish them.
Let me sometimes try to live those very emotions.
May your blessings remain there for me
You are my inspiration and you are my energy
Let's sit together and while enjoying Mann Ki Baat try to fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Once again next month we will meet again for another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
I Thank all of you once again.
Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
I begin Mann Ki Baat today with a heavy heart.
10 days ago, Mother India had to bear the loss of many of her valiant sons.
These brave hearts made the supreme sacrifice in securing the lives of a hundred twenty five crore Indians.
In order to ensure that their fellow countrymen could sleep peacefully, these brave sons toiled relentlessly, day or night.
Our armed forces have consistently displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjan ji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring.
He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy if need be, he himself would go and fight.
The country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
The mettle of this innocent lad is a representative sample of the feelings of each every child of the Nation today.
Similar sentiments are coming to the fore in the households of our brave heart martyrs.
No martyr, no family is an exception to that.
Whether it be the family of Martyr Vijay Maurya of Devariya, the parents of Martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six year old son of Martyr Hemraj of Kota the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
I urge the young generation to know and understand the fortitude and the sentiment displayed by these families.
these very examples are a source of inspiration for the future of a rising glowing India.
My dear countrymen, the rather long wait after Independence for a War Memorial is about to be over.
India not having a National War Memorial used to surprise me, pain me...
a Memorial that would house the valour saga series of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives, safe guarding their nations security.
And I took a resolve that the country must have such a Memorial.
We decided to erect the National War Memorial and I am contented to see it attaining completion in so little a time.
Tomorrow, that is on the 25th of February, crores of we Indians will dedicate this National Soldiers Memorial to our Armed Forces.
On part of the nation, this will be a small step towards repaying a great debt.
This new memorial has been instituted in the heart of Delhi, in close vicinity of India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I do believe that for our countrymen a visit to the National War Memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place.
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of the nations gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained Independence.
The Memorials design symbolises the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on the notion of four concentric circles, which depicts the journey of a soldier from coming into being, culminating in his martyrdom.
The flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
This is followed by the Tyag Chakra.
This circle houses a row of dense trees.
If you take a holistic view, the National Soldiers Memorial is sure to turn out to be a sacred site, where people will throng, to get information on our great martyrs, to express their gratitude, to conduct further research on them.
This place stands testimony to a series of sacrifices of men who laid down their lives for the sake of their country, so that we could live, so that the country could be safe secure, paving the way for development.
One falls short of words in assessing the enormous contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces in the strides of progress achieved by the country.
In the month of October last year, I was blessed with the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
That too echoed the same sentiment, and we believe that we should be ever grateful to those policemen police women, who relentlessly ensure our safety security.
I do hope that you will pay a visit to the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you are there, do capture images and share them on social media so that others get inspired to come visit this sacred site with eagerness.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I keep getting thousands of letters and comments from your side, on various platforms.
Once while I was going through your comments, I came across an interesting point by Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He has written that on the 3rd of March, 1900, the British arrested Birsa Munda, when he was just 25 years old.
Paying tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata is, in a way, salutation to the glorious legacy and history of Jharkhand.
These two distinguished personalities brought glory honour not just to Jharkhand, but the entire country.
The country is indeed grateful for their contribution.
Today, if an inspiring personality is required for ably guiding our youth, it certainly is that of Bhagwan Birsa Munda.
The British tree treacherously arrested him when he was asleep, in a covert manner.
Do you know why they had to resort to such a cowardly operation
And he accomplished all this in his rather short life.
He let sunshine peep into the darkened lives of the deprived and the oppressed.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the tender age of twenty five.
But its a misfortune that these tales of valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generations.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry was imperative for her future.
It was his vision that culminated in the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, which we know as Indian Institute of Science today.
Not just that, he also established world renowned institutions and industries such as Tata Steel.
On a voyage to America, Jamsetji Tata met Swami Vivekananda on the ship, and an important topic of their discussion was the outreach spread of Science Technology in India.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was born on the 29th of February.
All of you know that this day comes just once in four years.
A simple, peace loving personality, Morarji bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders.
In Independent India, the record of presenting the budget the maximum number of times is held by Morarji bhai Desai.
Morarji Desai steered the course of the country through some difficult times, when the very democratic fabric of the country was under a threat.
To save democracy, Morarji Desai flung himself in the movement against imposition of Emergency.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price in his old age.
The government of that time arrested and incarcerated him.
But when the Janata Party won the general elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his tenure, the 44th constitutional amendment was introduced.
This was important because the 42nd amendment which was brought during the emergency, curtailed the powers of the Supreme Court and implemented provisions which stood to violate our democratic values, was struck down.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was assassinated in 1975 by imposition of emergency, could never be repeated again in the future.
The upcoming generations of our nation will always remember his priceless contribution in maintaining the sanctity of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to a great leader like him.
My beloved countrymen, this year too, there was a great buzz about the Padma award.
Today as we head towards a new India, in which we want to honour those who are doing their work at the grass-root level without any care for a reward.
They, by their diligence, are powering positive changes in the lives of others in myriad ways.
They believe in living in the manner as preached by the shloka of Srimadbhagvad Gita 'Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', or excellence in action is yoga.
You must have heard about Odisha's Daitari Nayak, who is not nicknamed the 'Canal Man of Odisha' for nothing, Daitari Nayak chiselled through the mountain literally with his hands and carved a three kilometers long canal in his village, and put to rest forever the problem of irrigation and water by the sheer dint of his labour.
Take the case of Abdul Ghafoor Khatri of Gujarat, who has done an amazing job of reviving the traditional Rogan painting form of Kutch.
He is doing a great job of extending this rare painting art form to the present generation.
I had gifted a Rogan painting titled 'Tree of Life' done by Abdul Gafoor, to the former President of USA, Mr. Barack Obama.
Among the recipients of the Padma award, Shabbir Sayyed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata.
America's Tao Porchon-Lynch will leave you astounded, Lynch has become a living institution of yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, she is training yoga to people from all over the world and till now has trained 1500 as yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, famous nicknamed 'Lady Tarzan' in Jharkhand, most valiantly took on the Timber Mafia and Naxalites, and not only saved the 50 hectares of forest but also inspired ten thousand women to unite and protect the trees and wildlife.
Farmer Aunty of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, or Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring.
She has established a precedent in the direction of women empowerment and farming.
My dear countrymen, today I wish to narrate a heart rending experience with you which Ive been wanting to do past few days.
At present, whenever Im touring, it is my sincere effort to meet people beneficiaries of PMJAY scheme under Ayushman Bharats umbrella.
Brothers and Sisters, about 12 lakh impoverished families have benefitted from this scheme over a period of last five months.
I have found that it brings about a transformation in the life of the have-nots.
If you know a poor person who is unable to procure treatment due to lack of money, do inform him about this scheme.
In fact this scheme is meant for the benefit of such underprivileged people.
My dear countrymen, exam time in schools throughout the nation is soon going to dawn upon us.
In the next few weeks various education boards across the country will initiate the process for the board examinations of the tenth and twelfth standards.
My best wishes to all the students whore going to appear for their examinations, their parents and all the teachers as well.
A few weeks ago, an immense event entitled 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' was organised in Delhi in the format of a Town Hall programme.
All the students, their teachers and parents can watch the recording of this entire event on YouTube, and I take this opportunity to wish all the best to all my exam warriors, for their upcoming examinations.
My dear countrymen, no mention of India can be complete without citing its festivals.
It is just not possible that a day passes without any significance associated with it, or does not herald a festival
My dear countrymen, some days ago I went to Kashi and there I got a chance to spend time with my divyang brothers and sisters.
And he told me that he could mimic the Prime Minister.
I was very happy to hear that people not only listen to Mann KI Baat but also remember it on many occasions.
I was really impressed with the prowess of that divyang young man.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you, courtesy the Mann Ki Baat program has been a really wonderful experience for me.
Through radio I connect every month with millions of families.
Many times while conversing with you, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts sent on the phone, I feel that you have adopted me as part of your family.
This has been a very sublime experience for me.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy in the hurly-burly of the general elections.
I myself will also be a candidate during this election.
In maintaining respect for healthy democratic traditions, the next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be broadcast on the last Sunday of the month of May.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shri Shri Shri ShivaKumar Swamiji of District Tumukur, Karnataka was no more.
ShivaKumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to Social Service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us, Kayakave Kailas meaning discahrging ones duties with due dilligence and persevereance is akin to being in the abode of Lord Shiva ie Kailasha Dham.
ShivaKumar Swamiji was a true follower of this tenet .
He was a social reformer.
He dedicated his life in ensuring that food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge reached out to people.
The welfare of farmers was a priority in his life.
The Siddhganga Mutt regularily used to organise cattle and agricultural fairs.
On this occasion Kalam Saheb had recited a poem dedicated to revered Swamiji.
Kalam Sahebs poem potrays the life of Shri Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji and the mission of the Siddhganga Mutt beautifully.
Once again, I pay tribute to this great man.
My Dear Countrymen,On the 26th of January, 1950, our Constitution came in to being
our Country was proclaimed a Republic.
Yesterday, we celebrated Republic Day with pride and fervour.
But today I want to speak to you on a totally different aspect.
The scale at which elections are held in India is a matter of great awe for the World.
And you must have heard about Gujarat .
in a remote place in Gir forest, there is a polling booth for a sole voter.
Caring for that lone voter, for ensuring that he or she enjoys full opportunity to exercise the right to vote, personnel of Election Commission travel to distant remote places to make necessary arrangements for the voting.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for relentlessly striving to ensure the strengthening of our democracy.
I hold in high esteem, the Election Commissions of all states, security personnel and other staff members who contribute in ensuring strict adherence to free and fair polling.
this should be our disposition.
I sincerely hope that large numbers of eligible young people will get themselves registered as voters, thus forging a partnership in the quest to further strengthen our democracy.
My Dear Countrymen,This great land, India, has given birth to innumerable great men, men whose deeds for the sake for humanity have been extraordinary, truly unforgettable.
On the 23rd of January, the country celebrated the birth anniversary of Netaji in an uncommon, special manner.
On this occasion I was fortunate to get an opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to heroes who fought in Indias freedom struggle.
You may be aware of the fact that inside Red Fort, many chambers and structures lay locked unused for several decades after Independence.
Those very chambers have now been turned into exquisite museums.
A museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army Yaad-e-Jalian, reminiscences of Jalianwala Bagh and 1857 Indias first war of Independence constitute the premises of Kranti Mandir, that has been dedicated to the nation.
Every inch, every brick of these museums is redolent with the fragrance of our glorious history.
Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan had to face a trial under British Rule.
On my visit to Kranti Mandir, Red Fort, as I was reflecting on memories of Netaji, his family members gifted me a special cap.
The fact is, stories of the valour and patriotism of our heroes should be told and re-told to our newer generations in ways more than one.
Just a month ago, on the 30th of December, I had gone to Andaman Nicobar islands.
At an event, our tricolour was unfurled at the very site where Netaji Subhash Bose had unfurled it exactly 75 years ago.
In a similar manner, when the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, it surprised everyone, since conventionally, this is done on the 15th of August.
The occasion was the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and adept organiser
That files associated with Netaji be declassified has been a long standing demand for years.
And I am happy that we could manage to do the same.
I remember the day when Netajis family paid a visit to the Prime Ministers residence.
We dwelt at length on myriad facets of Netaji Subhash Bose, offering him tributes.
It gladdens me to see many places associated with illustrious sons of India being developed in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road, associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar, or the Sardar Patel museum or the Kranti Mandir
Whenever you come to Delhi, you must pay a visit to these places.
My dear countrymen, today as we refer to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with you an incident from Netajis life.
I have always considered Radio as an effective means of connecting with people.
Subhash Babu had a distinct style of opening a broadcast.
Programmes broadcast over Azad Hind Radio were very popular amongst the populace.
Their programmes were a major source of inspiration strength to our freedom fighters.
In this very Kranti Mandir, a visual arts museum has been established.
Indias art culture has been portrayed here in a very attractive way.
Exquisite works of great artists such as Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Sailoz Mukherjee have been exhibited.
And I also specially request you to visit the place and see for yourself the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
Now you must be thinking that we are discussing art and here Im talking about seeing Gurudev Tagore's excellent works of art.
You have probably known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore till date as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
And the most unique aspect was that Gurudev Tagore did not ascribe any name to most of his works.
He believed that the person seeing his painting should comprehend the painting in totality, from his own perspective, understand the message imparted by him in the particularpainting.
His paintings have been on display in European countries, in Russia and in America.
I hope you will go and see his paintings in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is a land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and deeds.
One such Saint was - Sant Ravidas.
On 19th February we will observe Ravidas Jayanti.
The couplets or dohas of Sant Ravidas ji are very well-known.
Sant Ravidas used to convey a profound message through the few lines of his couplet or doha.
He had said- , , Which would translate something like this that if you were to peel the stem of the banana tree, there appear leaves underneath which form the psuedostem, one can go peeling the leaves forming the stem till there isnt any tree left at all
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy city of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and the worker throughout his life via his messages.
It would not be wrong to say that he has illustrated to the entire world the real meaning of dignity of labour.
He would say - That is, if your heart is pure, then the Absolute master resides within your heart.
Sant Ravidas ji has influenced people cutting across every segment and class of the social milieu whether it was the Maharana of Chittor or his ueen or Meerabai, everyone was his follower were followers.
He also wants me to request the students to take interest in the space programs and to think out of the box and inspire them to go beyond the frontiers of the sky- Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and especially the message being imparted to our children.
Our space program has been possible due to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We take pride in the fact that the satellites developed by our students and Sounding Rockets have reached space.
The number of successful space missions attempted since the country's independence till 2014 have been equal to those successfully completed in the past four years.
We have also created a world record for launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is also using Space Technology in devices employed in saving assets and life.
Whether it is cyclone, or rail and road safety, all of these safety measures are being augmented by Space Technology.
We are using Space Technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
"Housing for all" or the "House for everyone" scheme involves geo-tagging of about 40 lakh homes spread over 23 states.
Along with this scheme, about thirty and a half million properties under MNREGA have also been tagged.
Today our satellites are a symbol of the country's growing might.
It has contributed a great deal in fostering better relations with many countries of the world.
Through its highly competitive launch services, India today not only propels satellites of developing countries but also those of developed nations.
The sky and stars have always enthralled children.
It is a vision to inspire the children to discover new stars, while gazing at them
In January about 6,000 players participated in 18 disciplines in the Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune.
When the player performs his best at the local level,only then, he also shines globally.
This time in 'Khelo India', participants from every state have performed well at their individual level.
The life of many a medal winner is also immensely inspiring.
I was reading that young Akash Gorkha who won a silver medal in boxing had his father, Ramesh Ji working as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
They live in a parking shed with their family.
The captain of Maharashtra Under-21 Women's Kabaddi team, Sonali Helvi is from Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age, and her brother and mother encouraged the talent and skills of Sonali.
It is often seen that girls are not encouraged much to participate in sports such as Kabaddi.
In spite of the hurdles, Sonali not only chose Kabaddi but excelled in this discipline.
10-year-old Abhinav Shaw hailing from Asansol is the youngest gold medallist in the Khelo India Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshaya Basavani Kamat, from Karnataka won a gold medal in weightlifting.
When we talk about the creation of a New India, then determination exhibited by our youth is the veritable example of what is New India
These inspiring stories from the annals of Khelo India, are ample proof , that the building of New India does not only involve contribution from the denizens of big cities but also from the youth, children, young sports talents, hailing from small cities, towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many a prestigious beauty contest.
But have you heard about the Shining Toilet contest
Over the past month, more than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique contest.
The name of this unique contest is "Clean beautiful Toilet".
People are making their toilets clean and colourful, by having them painted and other rennovations, you will find lots of photos of such toilets participating in the "Clean beautiful Toilet" contest spread from Kanya Kumari to Kutchh till Kamrup on social media.
I appeal to all the Sarpanchs and village heads to take a lead in this campaign in their respective Panchayats.
And do share your "clean beautiful toilet" photos with me on MylzzatGhar on social media.
Friends together, on October 2, 2014, we had embarked on a memorable journey together to clean our country and to get rid of open defecation.
My younger friends, the days of examinations are approaching .
Anshul Sharma, resident of Himachal Pradesh has written on MyGov that I should talk about examinations and Exam Warriors.
Students, their parents and teachers, all are engaged in tasks related to examinations.
In this 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' program, I will touch upon a lot of things related to all the facets of examinations with my young friends, especially on the topic of stress free exams.
I had urged people to send me thir inputs and ideas with regard to this programme
and I am very happy that a large number of people are sharing their thoughts on MyGov.
Some of these ideas and suggestions I will definitely put in front of you during the Town Hall program.
You must also try to become a part of this program . and through social media and Namo App, you can also see its live telecast.
My dear countrymen 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11am the whole country pays homage to the martyrs.
Wherever we are, we must pay two minutes tribute to our martyrs.
Let us ensure this journey of 2019 remains successful.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
The year 2018 is about to conclude.
We shall soon enter 2019.
it is equally so, to hear about resolutions for the year being ushered in.
Many good wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
You must have wondered how to keep 2018 etched in your memory
The year 2018 saw the launching of the worlds biggest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat.
Electricity reached each every village of the country this year.
Noted world institutions have accepted that the country has taken strides in the area of poverty alleviation at a record pace.
On account of the unwavering resolve of our countrymen, swachchata, sanitation coverage is rapidly advancing towards crossing the 95 mark.
After Independence, for the first time ever, the tricolor was hoisted at Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
The highest United Nations Environment Award Champions of the Earth was conferred upon India.
It is due to our collective efforts that our country has seen unprecedented improvement in the Ease of doing business rankings.
Daughters of the country have done her proud by circumnavigating the globe through the NavikaSagarParikrama.
Indias first inland waterway was launched in Varanasi.
This has laid the foundation of a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The longest rail-road bridge, Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the Nation- Sikkims first Indias hundredth airport, Pakyong commenced operations.
India scripted a thumping win in the under- 19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India clinched a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India also performed very well in the Para Asian Games too.
By the way, if I continue enumerating examples of the Purusharth, the character the mettle of Indians, or those of our collective endeavour, this episode of Mann Ki Baat will go on and on, perhaps to the point when 2019 makes an entry
And all this has been possible due to the relentless efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, this December we had to bear the loss of some extraordinary, exemplary countrymen.
On the 19th of December, Dr. Jayachandran passed away in Chennai.
People tell us that he would be ever ready eager, when it came to treatment of patients.
In the case of elderly patients, he would even bear the cost of their travelling to and fro.
On similar lines, on the 25th of December, I learnt of the loss of SulagittiNarsamma in Karnataka.
SulagittiNarsamma was a midwife, aiding pregnant women during childbirth.
In Karnataka, especially in far-off, remote places, thousands of women availed of her services.
In the beginning of this year, she was honoured with a Padma Shri.
Since we are referring to healthcare, I would like to mention the social endeavour of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, I was told by some of our party workers that a few young doctors in the town set up camps offering free treatment for the underprivileged.
Every month, the Heart Lungs Critical Centre there organizes such camps, where free diagnosis and treatment for a host of ailments is done.
Every month, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from these camps.
The dedication of these doctor friends engaged in selfless service is truly worthy of praise.
Today, Im saying it with pride that it was collective efforts that made the Swachch Bharat Mission a successful campaign.
I was told that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, over three lakh people came together to work for the sanitation campaign.
I am glad to observe that these days, there are many websites apprising us of inspiring life- stories of such remarkable gems.
Lets come together to make positivity viral.
Sports has its own significance in every society.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hanaya trained hard in Karate with perseverance fervor, studied its nuances and proved herself.
On behalf of all countrymen, I wish her a bright future.
Best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, the media discussed extensively about the 16 year old Rajani.
You too must have read it.
Rajani has won a gold medal at the Junior Womens Boxing Championship.
The moment Rajani won the medal she rushed to a nearby milk stall drank a glass of milk.
After that, she wrapped a cloth around the medal kept it in a bag.
You must be wondering why Rajani did that
She did it in honour of her father Jasmer Singh ji who sells lassi, at a stall in Panipat.
According to Rajani, her father has sacrificed a lot, undergone hardships to help her reach where she is.
Early every morning, Jasmer Singh used to leave for work before Rajani and her siblings woke up.
Despite so many hurdles, Rajani did not lose heart went ahead with her training in boxing.
She has won a medal in Serbia too.
My best wishes and blessings to Rajani.
I also congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani Ji for supporting encouraging Rajani.
This very month, 20 year old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest Asian to traverse the globe riding a bicycle.
She rode for 159 days, covering around 300 kilometres every day.
Just imagine... 300 kms of cycling every day
Her passion for cycling is indeed commendable.
When we come to know of such examples, we too feel inspired every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, the month of January ushers in many festivals filled with hope joy- such as Lohri, Pongal, MakrSankranti, Uttarayan, MaghBihu, Maaghi
It is during this period that the sun enters Uttarayan due to Northward movement of the earth on the celestial sphere and enters the Makardasha.
It is during this period that days begin to lengthen and the winter harvesting of our crops begins.
Best wishes to our food providers, the farming brothers and sisters.
Our festivals are replete with fragrance of the essence of Unity in Diversity and the spirit of One India Great India.
We can witness how closely our festivals are interlinked with nature.
In Indian culture society and nature are indistinguishable, in our culture the person and his environment are considered in totality.
A great example of the interconnection between us and Nature is the calendar based on our festivals.
It comprises festivals all around the year as well as the movements of the celestial bodies.
This traditional calendar depicts our bonding with natural and astronomical events.
The lunar and solar Calendars based on the movement of earth with respect to moon and sun decide the occurrence and dates of our festivals.
It is also dependant on the fact which calendar you follow.
In many regions the position of the planetary constellations determines the occurrence and celebration of festivals.
GudiPadva, Chettichand, Ugadi and others are all celebrated according to the lunar Calendar, whereas Tamil PutanduVishnu, Baisakh, Baisakhi, PoilaBoisakh, Bihu are all celebrated in accordance with solar calendar.
The sagacity of conserving rivers and water is inherently reflected in many of our festivals.
Chhath festival is associated with the worship of the sun, rivers and ponds.
Millions of people take a dip in the holy rivers on theoccasion of MakarSankranti.
Our festivals, impart to us many social values.
On the one hand, where they have mythological significance, on the other, every festival quite easily in itself teaches the important lesson of life - the value of staying together, imbued with a feeling of brotherhood.
Doo share the photographs taken on these festivals with one another so that everyone can witness the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there is an abundance of events in our culture, of which we can be proud and display them in the entire world with pride - and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
People from all over the country and around the world come and participate in the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, there is a tidal upsurge of faith and reverence.
Millions and millions of people from India and around the world congregate at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has bloomed and flourished as part of our great cultural heritage.
This time the world famous Kumbh Mela is going to be held in Prayagraj from January 15, and many of you might be waiting eagerly for it to take place.
The process of Sant- Mahatmas converging at the Kumbh Mela has already started.
It is a measure of its global importance that last year UNESCO has marked Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago the Ambassadors of many countries witnessed for themselves the preparations for Kumbh.
The national flags of many countries were together hoisted at the Kumbh.
The festival of Kumbh, to be organized in Prayagraj, is expected to have footfalls from more than 150 countries
I inaugrated the Integrated Command Control Center at the Kumbh which will be of great benefit to the devotees.
This time much emphasis is being laid on cleanliness during Kumbh.
If during the course of this event sanitation prevails along with reverence, then it will lead to a positive message reaching far and wide.
This time every devotee will be able to have a darshan of the pious Akshayavat after the holy dip in the confluence.
This great symbol of peoples faith was locked up in the fort for hundreds of years, due to which the devotees despite a deep seated desire could not get a glimpse of.
Now the entrance gate of Akshayavat have been opened for everyone.
I urge all of you to share different aspects of Kumbh and photos on social media when you go to Kumbh so that more and more people feel inspired to go to Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of Spirituality become Mahakumbh of Indian Philosophy.
May this Kumbh of aesthetics also become the Mahakumbh of creativity.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
We are fortunate that South African President Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa is going to grace the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest.
Our revered Bapu and South Africa shared an unbreakable bond.
It was South Africa, where Mohan transformed into the 'Mahatma'.
It was in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood rock steady in protest of apartheid.
He also founded the Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the demand for peace and justice echoed to the whole world.
The year2018 is also being celebrated as Birth centenary of Nelson Mandela,also known as 'Madiba'.
He derivedinspiration and endurancefor spending many years in jail from Bapu himself.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only sources of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals have always encouraged us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held at Kevdia on the banks of Narbada in Gujarat, where the world's highest statue 'Statue of Unity' is situated, there I had a meaningful discussion with the top policemen of the country.
What kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and that of the countrymen, was discussed in detail.
At the same conference, I also announced the awarding of 'Sardar Patel Award' for National Integration to be given to those who have contributed for national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life for the unity of the country.
He always remained engaged in keeping India's integrity intact.
SardarSaheb believed that the power of India lay in the diversity of the land.
It is our way of paying homage to Sardar Patel's aspirations through this award for National Integration.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the date ofthe sacred festival observed in honour of Guru Gobind Singh jis birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, his work was centred in North India and he sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
His birthplace was Patna, Karmabhoomi was north India and the last moments were spent in Nanded.
In a way, entire India received his blessings.
A glimpse of his life span reflects a glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru TeghBahadurji, Guru Gobind Singh Ji attained the hallowed position of the Guru at a tender ageof nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had inherited courage to fight for justice from the legacy of Sikh Gurus.
Shri Gobind Singh Ji believed that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering.
He was a divine figure full of heroism, valor, courage, sacrifice and devotion.
He had beatific knowledge of both weapons andShaastras.
He was an archer, and a pundit of Gurmukhi, BrajBhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu and many other languages.
I once again bow paying my obeisance to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Nutritious food is most essential for good health.
Come, imbued with renewed inspiration, renewed zeal, renewed resolution, new accomplishments, loftier goals lets move on, keep moving, change oneself and change the country too.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October, 2014, the pious occasion of Vijayadashmi, we embarked upon a journey together through the medium of Mann Ki Baat.
This journey has reached its 50th episode today.
Thus, this Golden Jubilee Episode is indeed gilt-edged in every sense of the term.
Your letters and phone calls this time pertain mostly to these 50 episodes.
Anshu Kumar Amar Kumar from Delhi on Mygov, Vikas Yadav from Patna
They are of the view that broadly speaking, their Prime Minister being associated with the latest in technology, Social Media and Mobile Apps
WHY did he choose radio as a medium to connect with his countrymen
Let me quote an incident.
The year was 1998.
I was then a party worker with the Bharatiya Janata Party organization in Himachal.
I exclaimed, India has exploded the bomb
I dont get it
Said he Sir, just listen to the radio. Indeed, that exactly was the topic of discussion on the radio.
It was then that he elaborated on how on the day of the nuclear test, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had announced to the Media and how he broke into a dance on listening to it on the radio.
I have been nursing that feeling ever since, acknowledging its power strength.
Hence when I became the Prime Minister, it was natural for me to turn towards a strong, effective medium.
I came across some feedback that is very interesting.
indiapositive has been the subject of quite an extensive discussion.
This is an exemplary glimpse of the feeling of positivity, innate to our countrymen.
People have shared their experiences, conveying the rise of selfless volunteerism as a consequence of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a change where people are increasingly willing to contribute for the sake of service to society.
I am overjoyed on account of the fact that through Mann Ki Baat, radio is rising as a popular medium, more than ever before.
As a run up to each episode of Mann Ki Baat, the expectations aspirations of listeners through their letters, online comments phone calls are crystal clear.
Modi may come and go, but this country will never let go of its UNITY permanence, our culture will always be immortal.
These minute stories encompassing a 130 crore countrymen will always stay alive.
This new inspiration zest will keep taking her to greater heights.
I would like to share a couple of personal experiences with you ...
who knows how soon these will reach our families who knows when social media will circulate them to usher in a revolution
someone who reprimands elders at home or even admonishingly orders the Prime Minister through a phone call
Who would have imagined that a small campaign selfie with daughter starting from a small village in Haryana would spread not only throughout the country but also across other countries as well.
At times Mann Ki Baat is also sneered at but 130 crore countrymen ever occupy a special pleace in my heart.
Their hearts and my heart beat to the same rhythm.
Mann Ki Baat is not about the Government it is about the society.
Mann Ki Baat addresses an aspirational India, an ambitious India.
In a way your question were the a personal, amiable touch.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat is that one feels like talking to a close acquaintance and not to the Prime Minister, and this is true democracy.
If I reply to the question asked by you straightaway then I will say that I do not make any preparation.
Actually, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Every time before Mann Ki Baat, letters are received from people
people share their ideas and view points on Mygov and Narendra Modi Mobile App and there is also a toll free number 1800117800
and by calling on this number, people record messages in their own voice.
My effort is that I read the maximum number of these letters and comments myself before Mann Ki Baat.
I listen to many phone calls too.
And as the episode of Mann Ki Baat draws closer, I read ideas and inputs sent by you very minutely while travelling.
My countrymen stay in my heart every moment and that is how the writers situation and ideas expressed in the letter become part of my thought process.
That letter does not remain a mere a piece of paper for me.
Then, I note down facts like the name of the village and of the person.
Honestly speaking, Mann Ki Baat carries my voice but the examples, emotions and spirit represent my countrymen, I thank every person contributing to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of persons whose names I have not been able to include in Mann Ki Baat but without any disappointment, they continue to send in their letters and comments.
An effort is also made that the concerned department should pay attention to such letters and comments which, somehow, could not be included in Mann Ki Baat.
I also thank my colleagues from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV Channels and the Social Media.
It is due to their hard work that Mann Ki Baat reaches maximum number of people.
The team from All India Radio prepares each episode for broadcast in a number of regional languages.
Some of them very aptly narrate in a voice and style resembling that of Modis.
In this way for those 30 minutes they become Narendra Modi.
I would request all of you also to kindly listen to this programme in your regional language as well.
No political person is ever happy with the media, he feels that he is getting a very little coverage or the coverage given to him is negative.
But many issues raised in Mann Ki Baat have been adopted by the media.
Issues such as cleanliness, Road safety, drugs free India, selfie with daughter have been taken up by the media and turn into campaigns.
Without your contribution and cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Nidhi ji, many thanks for your phone call
To tell you the truth, I have no such secret.
There are old baggages of our own lives and when they do not come in the way, it becomes easier to understand others.
Sometimes our inhibitions or prejudices become a big hurdle in communication.
I prefer to understand the other mans point of view rather than going through the process of acceptance, rejection and reaction.
My effort is to have a continuous dialogue with the youth in various programmes or through social media.
I try to learn from whatever they are doing or whatever they are thinking.
I say it is good that the youth ask questions.
They do so because they are adept in multitasking.
If we just look around, we find that it is the youth who are bringing in transformation of society in a big way, may it be social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports or any other field.
Those youth who have dared to ask questions and have had the courage to dream big.
If we put these ideas of our youth into practice and provide them conducive environment to express themselves, they surely will bring about a constructive and a positive change in the country- they are already doing so.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram- has posted on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat I should talk about the Constitution Day which falls on the 26th November.
She says that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of our Constitution adoption.
Thank you very much for your suggestion Vineeta ji.
Just imagine, these luminaries gave us such a comprehensive and detailed Constitution within a period of just less than 3 years.
The extraordinary pace at which they drafted the Constitution is an example of Time Management and productivity to emulate even today.
This also inspires us to accomplish our responsibilities within a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was an amalgamation of the great talents of the country, each one of them was committed to provide a Constitution to the country which empowers the people of India and enriches even the poorest of the poor.
The unique point in our Constitution is that the rights and duties have been very comprehensively detailed.
A balance between these two in the lives of our citizens will take our nation forward.
I still remember that in 2010 when 60 years of the adoption of the Constitution were being celebrated, we had taken out a procession by placing our Constitution atop an elephant.
This has been a memorable incident to increase awareness about our Constitution among the youth and to connect them to the various aspects of the Constitution.
In the year 2020, we shall complete 70 years as a Republic and in 2022, we shall enter 75th year of our Independence.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of that great man cannot be forgotten who played a pivotal role in the Constituent Assembly.
Democracy was embedded deep in Baba Sahebs nature and he used to say that Indias democratic values have not been imported from outside.
What is a republic and what is a parliamentary system- are nothing new to India.
India First was the basic doctrine of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Once again my humble tribute to revered Baba Saheb.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always envisaged the welfare of entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, kindness and amity to the society.
The country will observe Guru Nahak Dev Jis 550th birth anniversary in a grand way, its soothing colours will not only spread in India alone but will get sprinkled the world over.
All states and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner.
Guru Nanak Dev Jis 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in a similar manner in all the countries of the world as well.
Besides, a train will be run on a route joining all the holy places connected with Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Recently, while holding a meeting in this regard I remembered about of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
This Gurudwara suffered severe damage due to the devastating earth quake of 2001 in Gujarat.
But, the manner in which the local people joined hands with the state Government in renovating it, is an example even today.
The Government of India has taken a significant decision of building Kartarpur corridor so that our countrymen could easily visit Kartarpur in Pakistan to pay homage to Guru Nanak Dev Ji at that holy sight.
Come on, let us take this journey further.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
The 31st of October is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year too, the youth of the country is all set, to take part in the Run for Unity.
The weather too these days is pleasant.
I urge you to participate in the largest possible numbers in this run for unity.
Six months or so before Independence, on the 27th of January, 1947, the world famous international Magazine Time had a photograph of Sardar Patel on the cover page of that edition.
In their lead story, they had depicted a map of India
it was nowhere close to what the map looks like now.
It was the map of an India that was divided into myriad fragments.
There existed over 550 princely states.
The English had lost interest in India they wanted to leave India fragmented into pieces.
The story also brings to the fore other aspects of the life of the Iron Man of India...
the manner in which he had managed relief operations during the Ahmedabad floods in the 1920s the way he steered the Bardoli Satyagrah.
Gandhiji considered Sardar Patel as the only one capable of finding a lasting solution to the vexed issue of the states and asked him to act.
It is but natural for us to solemnly remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as we exalt the spirit of unity that binds our Nation, our Mother India.
Erected on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, the structure is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.
This is the worlds tallest scyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud to see the worlds tallest statue here on Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, a true son of the soil will adorn our skies too.
Of course, the inner wish to visit the statue of unity will come naturally to every Indian.
I am sure this will turn out to be a described destination for one all across the country.
My dear brothers sisters, we celebrated Infantry Day yesterday.
I respectfully bow before all of them who are part of the Indian Armed Forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
But, do you know why we Indian citizens commemorate this day as Infantry Day
This is the very day when Indian Forces landed in Kashmir and saved the valley from the clutches of aggression.
This incident too is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with the celebrated Army officer sam Manekshaw.
In that interview, field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was reminiscing on times when he was a Colonel.
Around this time, military operations commenced in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw has mentioned how in a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was irked on the delay in sending troops to Kashmir During the proceedings, Sardar Patel gave him a characteristic glance and reiterated that there should be no delay in our Army operation and that a solution should be sought swiftly.
My dear countrymen, who doesnt love sports
Elements like spirit, strength, skill, stamina are extremely important in the world of sports.
They are the ultimate test for a sportspersons mettle...
all four of these virtues form the core foundation of nation building universally.
If the youth of a country possess these qualities, that country will progress not only in areas such as Economy and Science Technology but also bring laurels home in the field of sports.
Just recently I had two memorable meetings.
First, I got an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held at Jakarta.
These athletes bagged a tally of 72 medals, creating a new, unprecedented record, bringing glory to the nation.
I was fortunate to get an opportunity to meet all these talented athletes personally.
Similarly, I was blessed with a chance to meet our winners of the Summer youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be pleased to know that in the Summer Youth Olympics 2018, the performance of our youth was the best ever.
At this event we won 13 medals besides 3 in mixed events.
You may recall that even, in the recent Asian Games, Indias performance was par excellence.
Have you observed the way I have frequently used terms such as the best ever or new, unprecedented record
India is setting new records not just in the field of sports but also in hitherto uncharted areas.
After leaving the orphanage, he eked out a living cleaning DTC buses and working as waiter at roadside eateries.
The same Narayan is winning medals for India at International events.
Not just that, just observe the rapidly enhancing levels of excellence in Indian sports
Hitherto, India had never won a medal in a Judo event, at the junior or senior level.
But Tabaabi Devi created history by bagging the silver medal at the youth Olympics.
16 year old player Tabaabi Devi hails from a village in Manipur.
Her father is a labourer and mother a fish-seller.
There were times when the family had no money to buy food.
Even such hardships were not able to cow down her zest devotion.
And she has created history by winning a medal for the country.
Every young sportspersons passion dedication is the hallmark of New India.
My dear countrymen, you may recall that we had successfully organized FIFA Under- 17 World Cup in the year 2017.
The whole world acclaimed this as a very successful tournament.
FIFA Under -17 World Cup had created a record in terms of the number of viewers on the ground.
More than 12 lakh enthusiasts enjoyed the romance of Football matches in various stadia across the country and boosted the morale of the young players.
This year also, we have been fortunate to be the hosts of the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneshwar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence on the 28th November to be concluded on the 16th December.
Each Indian who plays any game or has interest in any game has a definite interest in Hockey.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
Hockey maestro Major Dhyan Chand is a renowned name all over the world.
Then, from Balbeer Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhan Raj Pillai, Indian Hockey has had a very long journey.
Even today, players of Team India are encouraging the younger generation through their hard work and focused attention.
It is a good chance for the sport lovers to witness closely contested matches.
Go to Bhubaneshwar and cheer up the Indian team and also encourage each team there.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward and volunteering for social works is really inspirational and encouraging for all our countrymen.
Service is Supreme has been Indias tradition since centuries and we can feel the scent of this tradition in each and every sector today as well.
But, in this new era, the new generation is coming forward in a new way with a fresh vigour and spirit to fulfill their new dream.
Recently, I attended a programme where a portal was launched, its name is Self 4 Society, MyGov and the IT and Electronics industry of the country have launched this portal with a view to motivating their employees for social activities and providing them with opportunities to perform in this field.
Their dedication and vigour can make each Indian feel proud.
A fresh and pleasant air of IT to society, We-not I, a transformation from the individual to the community is imbibed in this.
Someone is teaching the old people
someone is involved in the campaign of cleanliness whereas someone is helping out the farmers.
And there is no vested interest behind all these activities but a pure feeling of dedication and resolve is the driving force.
One young person learned to play wheelchair basket ball in order to be able to help the wheelchair basket ball team of differently abled, divyang players.
This spirit, this dedication is a mission mode activity.
Will this not make every Indian feel proud.
This spirit of We, not I will surely inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was going through your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat this time, I found a very interesting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pudducherry.
He wrote on Mygov- Please take up the topic in Mann Ki Baat as to how the tribes and their traditions and rituals are the best examples of coexistence with the nature.
Manishji, I appreciate you for bringing this subject among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one subject that inspires us to look into our dignified past and our ancient traditions, Today, the whole world and specially the western countries are discussing about environment protection and are trying to find new ways to adopt a balanced life style.
Our country is also facing this problem.
But, for its solution we only have to look inwards, to look into our glorious past and our rich traditions and have especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
To live in consonance and closed coordination with the nature has been an integral part of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brethren worship trees and plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribes of Central India and specially those in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship Peepal and Arjun trees religiously.
The Bishnoi community in the desert land of Rajasthan has shown us a way of environment protection.
Specially, in the context of serving trees, they prefer laying down their lives but cannot tolerate any harm to a single tree.
Mishmi tribes of Arunachal Pradesh claim their relationship with tigers.
They even treat them like their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland as well, tigers are seen as the forest guardians.
The Gond tribes in Central Indai stop fishing in some parts of Kaithan river during the breeding season.
Tribal communities make their dwelling units from natural material which are strong as well as eco-friendly.
In the isolated regions of the Nilgiri plateau in South India, a small wanderer community Toda make their settlements using locally available material only.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a fact that the tribal community believes in very peaceful and harmonious co-existence but, if somebody tries to harm and cause damage to their natural resources, they do not shy away from fighting for their rights.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those persons and institutions who make extra-ordinary contribution for the society.
These works may seem small but have a very deep impact in changing our thinking and in giving a new direction to the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about a farmer brother Gurbachan Singh from Punjab.
The son of this hard working farmer Gurbachan Singh ji was to be married.
Gurbachan Singh ji had told the brides parents that the marriage would be performed in a solemn manner.
But, you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a simple farmer and what he told the brides father and the condition he placed reflects the true strength of our society.
Shriman Gurbachan Singh jis family has presented one such example before us.
I have also read about a village Kallar Majra which is near Nabha in Punjab.
Kallar Majra came into lime light as the farmers there mix the stubble with the sand by ploughing their fields rather than burning the stubble and adopt the necessary technology for the process.
Congratulations to bhai Gurbachan Singh ji
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and of all those places who are making their best efforts to keep the environment clean and pollution free.
All of you are carrying forward the Indian tradition of a healthy life style as a true successor.
Just as a sea is formed by collection of tiny drops, similarly,a small constructive step, plays a vital role in creating a positive environment.
Grant peace to each soul, each heart, in me, in you, in every particle and everywhere in the Universe.
For India, 11th of November this year has a special significance because on 11th November a hundred years back the World War I had ended.
Ending of that war is completing one hundred years meaning thereby that a century of ending of the vast devastation and human loss would also get completed.
For India, World War I was an important event.
Rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war.
Despite this, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed it to the world that they are second to none if it comes to war.
Our soldiers have displayed great valour in difficult areas and adverse conditions.
There has just been a single objective behind it- Restoration of peace.
The world witnessed a dance of death and devastation during the World War I
According to estimates, around one crore soldiers and almost the same number of civilians lost their lives.
This made the whole world realize and understand the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace does not only mean no war.
There is a need to work unitedly to address issues such as terrorism, climate change, economic development to social justice through universal cooperation and co-ordination.
Development of the poorest of the poor is the real indicator of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-East has a unique distinction of its own.
The natural beauty of North East has no parallel and the people of this area are extremely talented.
You will be delighted to know that this best policy making award is equivalent to an Oscar in the sector.
Not only this, our Sikkim outperformed 51 nominated policies of 25 countries to win this award.
For this, I heartily compliment the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, October is about to end.
uite a change is being felt in the weather.
Winter has set in and with the changing weather, the season of festivals has also set in - Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaiya Dooj, Chhatth in a way it can be said that the month of November is the month of festivals.
I extend my best wishes to all countrymen for these festivals.
I would request all of you to take best care of yourselves and take care of your health as well and also take care of social interests.
I am sure these festivals are an opportunity to make new resolves.
These festivals prove a chance to advance in a mission mode and to make firm resolves in your life.
Your progress is a vital part of the countrys progress.
The more you progress, the more will the country progress.
My best wishes to you all.
