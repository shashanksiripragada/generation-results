Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other hand there is a mixture of both in Gujarat as well .
It is called ' kutchi ' .
As such this is ' dialect ' , this is not its own script .
If you want to write Kutch then you will have to write it in Gujarati script .
Anjar is just near Bhuj where many times earthquake has occurred and the entire city has been devastated .
The tomb of Jaisal-Tural is near Anjar .
The talk of Jaisalmer is very interesting .
If we come to Maghari from the road ways on which we had come then we will have to take a full month 's leave and schools will start here in Mumbai .
So what to do  Come let us take the fast trains of Gujarat by rail route .
The small railway of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there one more small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going on being in bad shape these days .
Due to world recession and the threat of rising terrorism in South Asia the tourism industry has been shocked .
With regard to tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan from the major states of the country has decreased these days .
According to the figures released recently by the Rajasthan government , the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent as compared to 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 national and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , the director of Halide Makers at Rajput says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have adversely affected the tourism business .
Compared to other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong infrastructure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has been proved good for the past few years .
This is the first time after 2002 when there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , havelis , forts , bavada forests all are old to see the tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments do big things regarding rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism but nothing can be done in this regard .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
This state has been marked internationally by the bravery and shadowing of foreign women tourists .
Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in this state for a long time but it was limited to papers only .
Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
Rajasthan government had established RTDC in the year 1979 with the aim of increasing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic form of tourism .
This institute provides facilities like residence , food , communication , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 departments of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one communication component and two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but for some years the situation of this institute has also worsened .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lac which is likely to be 632 lac in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this conglomerate is this that in the last five years even 40 percent rooms of its hotels have not been filled .
Along with hotels other factors of the organization are also harming it .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attraction towards this train .
Even by reducing the fares this could not attract the tourists .
In the same way there has been a disagreement among the tourists regarding the Pushkar Fair in the present year .
In 2007 - 08 the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair where 398 foreign tourists had stopped , this year there has been a gap in this number and that is 217 .
One thing satisfying with this RTDC was that there was no dearth of tourists in the attraction of Palace on Wheels i . . the royal fire .
This fire engine is bringing benefits .
Last year RTDC benefited from this railways at a rate of nine and a half crores .
This slowness coming in the area of tourism in Rajasthan has become a matter of concern for the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If a person has a desire to do something then he can bring gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has fulfilled this fact by establishing a modern city Embo Valley in the middle of the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The joy in his eyes is flourishing on seeing his dreams which he had dreamt developing day by day .
His joy was seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley as well .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley was successful in building its own place in the form of a unique city .
In this city spread in an area of more than 10 thousand acres there are hotels , houses and other facilities on only 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , ponds , carpets and other facilities have been made available .
Several industrialists came forward to make their houses in this city made for the royal family and today there are around 800 families living in this city .
Initially the businessmen and the Sri Lankans sold their Asia in the form of holiday home but now they have made it their home and they also go to Mumbai for work .
Behind the Embay Valley itself is the Koyarigarh Fort which enhances the beauty of this region .
The ruins of Likawali in West Siyang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found while digging .
On the pillars of rocks of this temple a carved work of lotus and statues of gods and goddesses has been done , which is in very dilapidated state .
Malini Thaan is an important place in this area .
On this spot a decorated idol of Durga Devi is found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet tales and ancient tales are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still present in the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in this ruin is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient texts the description of the glory of Goddess Tamreshwari is found .
During the reign of Chetia this goddess was recognized far and wide in the mountains in the North-East .
The tribal people here used to worship Goddess .
Human sacrifice was also given here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other relics have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called relics of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the terrain between the Dibang and Diwang rivers .
According to the famous scriptures here this place is old Vidarbha , where once King Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmakund is in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of the Lohit district .
Diguru , Mishmi etcetera here guide the travellers .
These people themselves have great respect for this Kunda .
Near Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned relics mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in Diwang - Valley district are also historically important .
The ruins of the lakes of bricks near Roing are telling their story even today .
The ghats of bathing , being surrounded by pucca lives and other ponds on all sides and the ruins of the wide roads are still singing silent songs of our ancient grandeur .
You can reach ero in four hours by jeep from the upper Assam city of North Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
This pleasant mountain place at a height of approximately 4500 feet attracts the tourists .
This is that charming place where people of Aptani community live .
It took several days for the jeep to reach here before becoming a road .
On reaching here the views of high - high cedar trees , beautiful premise , walnuts , wild currents , strawberries and rasberries overwhelm the tourists .
There are many products of apple and apricot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometers .
This beautiful valley is the residence of Apatani people .
With its untiring hard work the Aptani people have made it their heaven .
There was a lot of rice cultivation here .
This place is the treasure of rice .
Ten miles long this is a living example of the hard work and skill of the mountaineers in farming .
The requirement of irrigation of black rivers is fulfilled .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the mild redness emanating from the sky on the horizon in the middle of the queues of the mountain covered with snow of the left hand .
It is very cold in the air .
One also feels wet along with touching cold in the atmosphere .
The sound of litter below the legs is seen on the layer of the leaves laid on the wooden floor .
There is silence in the atmosphere and because of sunrise being spread much was not visible .
The vision is focussed on the redness of the east .
The heart was resting on the benches lying in Balcony .
As soon as the hand begins the layer of ice gets twisted with a slight sound and the hand gets twisted in the moment it feels cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of life in Switzerland to spend the night coming in this small village settled amidst these mountains .
This is my third trip to Swiss .
Before this much time was spent in Geneva or around it .
Dat village settled on both the sides of the Balakhati river in the valley is spread on a slight slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Rhone , on both the sides of which many small towns are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the cars running on it are clearly visible .
300 kms away and half an hour journey of Karni and half an hour along the Jeneva lake and half a roan river coming from the east side near the city named Ron river Montreux which is called Lec Lemon in French -LRB- Lock Lemon -RRB- .
Geneva city is located at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake turns westwards after becoming a river .
On the right side near the lake are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Leuke we left from this highway on the left side , the road to the northern hills comes .
Due to being the slope of the mountain in southern direction the evening sun is giving abundant fervour to all the birds .
There is less amount of snow than the valley here - almost all of a sudden .
As the height progresses towards the height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Even if good snow is frozen on both the sides of the road even then there is no special coldness in the air due to the clear sky and the shining sun .
On this curved hill juice after covering a journey of about 20 kms we reached a small village named Thele .
Chalet -LRB- Chalet -RRB- - Contiguous with descending roofs , there are big , huge , multi-storied bungalows made of wood .
In the basement built by the cement concrete of this three storey bungalow there are rooms to control the essential services like electricity , water , laundry etc . along with the parking of cars .
Valaya is famous for grapes farming in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes .
37 percent land of the entire cantonment is cultivated by grapes .
The gardens of grapes in the villages located on both the sides of the Rong Valley provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Take the fields of wine yards , roam them around , rest in the night in the villages there and taste the wine tasting taking them to the factories of grapes is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aighle there is a very big museum of wine made of chicken pox in a small fort built in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to register themselves .
Once again we people go through the same forest covered with dense forests .
The heart gets filled with the questions of children falling on the road for three to four kilometres .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come in a sight on one turn .
Just in front of the road on the left side of the road on the slope above the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is located .
People are skiing in snow on the slopes of the upper part of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
There is heavy snowfall all around .
The roofs of the houses of the colonies are shining due to the direct sun rays .
In five minutes we reach that village .
The same peace is spread here as well .
All around from the peak of the mountain till the valley there is a empire of white snow .
Within the next five minutes you reach a large round chakra in the middle of that chair .
The name of Kasba is Leukerbad .
The population of Leukarbad located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 sadanikas and shalets having capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels for staying in 1500 , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
65 sources of hot water have been found till now in Leukarabad .

On reaching the village one feels extreme heat .
A huge layer of snow is glittering on the roofs of the houses in the joyous sunshine of Kovalam .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the places found in the form of national importance heritage in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxis , therefore checking does not happen .
The journey is on , the area is on , but the mountain is the same , the same is on the trees , the same is the thrilling air .
The weight of flying layer on the whole body is only that .
In the season of monsoons there is an abundance of fitness .
As soon as the plan for Darjeeling journey was fixed it was decided to take a glimpse of Kurseong .
Kursing is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea estates , complete with smoke jungles .
It is famous for excellent tea production .
If we move ahead from Siliguri towards Darjeeling then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the people coming here smiling .
Going through the roadways through the tea gardens attracts hearts for the first time .
On the one side a green mountain full of forests , and on the other a deep green valley .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are visible here .
There was a empire of greenery all around .
Once I got scared to see these natural jungles that we saw vegetation of tea planted by humans .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The more beautiful jungles the more beautiful are the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If we turn our sights on the roads then the universe is unique .
The circular and circular roads of snake charmer were moving ahead .
Time had also passed .
If it was not finished then it was forest and tea gardens .
At times small settlements were visible .
From a distance a hill appeared very dense than houses and houses .
This was Kurseong .
Staying here at one place we made a program of touring the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we left for Kurseong ' s picnic .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests on all the four sides .
To reach up to the deer park the vehicle has to be left very low .
Even though Kurseong is full of beauty has not yet been developed as a tourist spot .
While the city is very good and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the joy of reaching till the Deer Park surrounded by forests and climbing through the smoke trees was giving us the joy of climbing the road .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
On the other side of this city there is a point situated at a height .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to die by jumping from here .
At present there is a park and hotel here .
There is a ziny like dome here from whose height a beautiful scene is created by observing the entire city .
In the tea gardens nearby women were immersed in tea gardens by pressing a hat on their backs and drifting their hands in a hurry .
There is a museum outside the Kursing city but that day we could not go there because touring in the deserted environment of tea gardens was more necessary .
Next day it is certain to roam around Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but it was a bigger concern than this that if it was raining then how would we roam .
But it was very good coincidence that on reaching Rock Garden we enjoyed the bright enjoyment of the sun set .
This park is a very attractive place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
Going a little further down from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The beauty of the waterfalls located in the rocks here is worth seeing .
We found in Rock Garden that waterfalls are very beautiful in the empire of rocks and rocks here , while the majestic beauty of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is enriched with rocks .
Both of these places are sitting very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling rising above with the help of a car .
From here the whole of the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen through binoculars .
The waves of the weather were clean till now .
But as we went towards the monastery , we did n't know where the hustle-bustle came and began to spoon .
In the evening plans were made to roam and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling toy train enhances the beauty of the journey .
The toy train from Darjeeling to Ghum and from Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in the Egyptian lakes and breakfast in the park here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar through this route , where sweaters woven by Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong though is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape - colour is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , but there is abundance of forest - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Apollo and Lolegaon , which is filled with jungle waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had just come to Darjeeling from Kolkata . had seen Darjeeling in the shadow of winters but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling kept me tied here .
My present small journey was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was neither of a foreign country nor of a foreign country but is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an attractive subject in itself in which sometimes travel attracts towards itself , sometimes be it a special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like a pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
People get attracted due to some special attraction .
The place I am going to talk about is prepared only four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has come there , he has truly done the welfare of the forest .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide Rambahu revolves around in my ears . Sahib could not even think before that that we could stay in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajabgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur before and now in Aman Bagh of this unique royal estate .
He brought his moving in a new color .
Sahiba ' is the prediction of Aman Bagh .
There nobody talks with you English instruction .
Aman Bagh is really a picnic spot with peaceful chains and all the comforts .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces itself to the region nearby .
Of the people celebrating holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan , how many people must have traveled to Bhangarh of the past , how far they would have gone to Kashla , even some people from the residents of Jaipur might have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Garden many big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I still remember that night when Shabana Azmi had spoken to me there , but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh leaving behind the hustle-bustle .
During this when suddenly I reached there with the help of my foreign travellers then it felt that if people want to spend a good holiday in a short span of time then they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to hunt for hunting .
Its construction took place in sixteenth century .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of peace garden attracts you .
The way you come in , the way you are welcomed , it feels that a divine peace has been taken care of here .
In Mangata Mantra of Mangalacharya along with original organisation a live pronunciation is made .
We had reached after evening and decided to kill that garden .
My host Jackie who is an architect easily said , it is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . it was not surprising that Aman Bag has also received the award for the present time .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all walked with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbagarh on which the rays of the sun used to spread gradually .
Watching the dry lake in which the peasants were farming .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
Such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience for Jackie .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of the Hallland sitting in meditation .
These are million dollars invaluable moments .
The custom of satisfying Aman Garden was also traditional , by giving us jaggery and curd food they gave us sufficient answer .
Now it came to be known why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that for seeing the life of the tribe a bird 's eye view is kept .
Is this right
Undoubtedly this is not the only one in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this staying there , food etc . are also included .
This way an attempt is made to discover such a place where there has not been much development and where there has not been any effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
On that spot where old tourist spots etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing all the triditional cuisines .
Actually , the aim of such tours was to make the tourists aware of the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although this idea seems a bit difficult , but such tourism is really attractive and gives a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
With this you can take the pleasure of roaming alone even after staying with many people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give more time to your favorite books without interruption .
Yes , it is definitely that along with giving less expense and comfortably a lot of time these tours definitely keep expectations of patience from you .
This is the reason that to enjoy these things it is important to keep in mind some things , specially when you are watching some foreign favorite place with the help of bus tour .
Find a best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senators of military , children and others get a suit on these , and there is arrangement of giving suits for two people as well .
As such buying advance tickets is cheaper , therefore it is better to plan the bus tour at the last minute as soon as possible .
Instead of two wheelers get information about round trips .
These are cheap .
Rules regarding bags are specially strict , therefore take care of the shape and weight of the luggage .
It should never be such that you will have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or you will have to charge more .
Also enquire about insurance or loss compensation from tourism company .
Carry on bags are appropriate , take them .
Because above this seat they sit right in the rocks .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of luggage is on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season you should give special attention to these things .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better the option of seat will be with you .
Keep in mind whether it is comfortable while choosing the seat .
On the back seat if the heart will be more restless , then the next seat will not be conferred .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like excessive interruption , then the window seat will be better for you .
Now there is a talk of a quarter .
If you are both in the opinion of making a mistake then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then while choosing the seat keep in mind this thing as well , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make the identity of bus driver and conductor .
In such a case you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because if they lose they do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do n't come in time then you can find another person in your place and you will have to wait for the bus .

The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is contiguous with its beautiful sea shores and various water sports which is like a heaven for tourists where through the tourism of ancient churches the magnificence of ancient times is easily seen .
The Ginger Hotel located in Goa ' s capital Panaji makes this journey of the western shores excellent .
Ginger Hotel situated here is an excellent option to spend a long time enjoying cycling , river cruise , cold sea cruise and world famous Goan food on the way to Goa .
If seen today 's date then the fare for Maldives to return to the cheapest person from Delhi is 28 thousand rupees .
After that even if you stay in Malaysia you can get hotels at a smaller rate but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the tasty beauty of Maldives then it will be very small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise from Kochi started the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous for cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some complications Louis Cruise has now postponed his service , but there is a possibility of his resumption since October .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least 5850 rupees per person on Louis Cruise ship on MV Aquamarine .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two grow older then it is completely free for children less than 15 years of age .
What should be done more .
Tea , breakfast , food are included in the cruise fares .
Every time with entertainment .
On reaching the capital Malle you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives in the interest of your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While flying in big airplanes suddenly stand in front of you a sea plane then you will feel like playing .
But this twelve - fifteen seat plane Maldives is the best for roaming in the islands .
Running like a speed boat from the surface of water he does n't even know when he is flying in the air .
In the entire journey we do not feel the journey of ordinary flights .
Keeping in mind the diverse blue waters of the Maldives , resort islands and coral islands it keeps on moving continuously below the window .
Everyone looks so clean .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these companies with 20 aircrafts .
If you want you can travel by air for about 4 thousand rupees -LRB- everyone -RRB- or the whole of the plane can take you on rent throughout the day -LRB- just be filled -RRB- .
If we go to any island other than Male island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel on various islands .
And this is such a journey that we do n't want to end .
Sea flights take the journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- north Mavilevaru -RRB- on Maldives island .
We were in the most ancient and sovereign shops of the capital in the Ahmadabadi market of Male .
All the vendors were listening carefully to the address given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed at the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier .
To be honest, I have not seen any Indian listening to the President or the Prime Minister so carefully.
But the question of the existence of a supernatural object on this planet was so serious that it was natural .
Many people might have understood the meeting happening inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but going to Maldives it feels as if the nature ' s wrath is taking it away from us then the world will be sad .
There is something special in the beauty of this place .
There is not so much of beauty in that small country .
After that journey of the market while returning to the port to go back on the cruise if you go to the sea then it feels as if the people here treasure the beauty of the beauty .
The water was so clean that the fishes swimming in deep under the shadow of the lamppost look all along with their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you are able to see some centimetres clearly in the water of the sea or river near any city of India then consider yourself as an addict .
While returning from the MV aquarium , the evening spent in Malaysia keeps on putting rings in the mind for two hours .
Praval stone -LRB- Munga stone -RRB- is the life of this place .
So much so that on the rocks on the ceiling you will get to see moong rocks .
After listening to the address of President Nasheed for some time we were standing outside his official residence .
Actually it did n't seem that we were standing outside the habitat of a supreme handicraft in the country and there was no security guard on far off places .
Interestingly we were taking photographs of only fifty metres long gardens and verandahs within the doors of their bungalow .
Can you think of a leader's house in India
It was also understood that the President sometimes proceeded to his office two houses after crossing the road on his own .
Everything related to the Maldives was enhancing its curiosity .
That is why I waited the next day in a hurry .
It seemed that the day would be special .
In the morning a name from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we roamed around in the runway on the base of Trans Maldives .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near the Male then we immediately got to know the plane passing above .
He had seen so many photographs .
But then it was not imagined that the next day there would be an opportunity of roaming around it .
We had to go to Rangali Island one hundred five kilometres long by the sea plane of Trauss Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread over the sea of Maldives by the sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres .
This kind of beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
With thrill and enthusiasm one gets such a flight .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hillton Hotel in the Rangali island it felt as if we have reached in a different world .
In such a world which has nothing to do with any outside world .
There was no such relationship that it was not possible to get out of beauty and comfort like that .
The journey of Konark can also be done on foot or by a battery driven car .
The scene of water on both the sides of the bridge going from the port to the main island is unique .
Now we could not separate ourselves from the surrounding nature then we reached such a place which was unimaginable .
While descending in the water below the sea till several metres below the stairs we went to such a room of glass which was in water .
Our room was ultimately a dining room .
We were able to see unique types of small fish , flocks , snorkelling and scuba diving manses across the glass everywhere .
The imagination of eating and drinking on the tables there was totally amazing .
The cost of seeing this island by sea plane from Male and taking dinner under water is 47 thousand rupees .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to leave our passport in water .
But it was known that it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we turned back with the hope that sometimes addicted will come back to this place .
For many days it was decided to go away from Delhi but due to the busyness of work it was not possible .
Since childhood wild life was fond of , then thought of not letting go to Jim Corbett at this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike journey after biking till Pegong pond near Khardungla in Ladakh .
In the afternoon 27 we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the enthusiasm with which we had set out our speed was blown up .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Wash off and bad roads ahead .
Many a times it felt that it has come .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
As such we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was frozen near the park which we had already registered .
That day there were no special programs but we went to tour on the coast of Kosi for the first time despite being cold .
After spending two - three hours there we went to see a Corbett museum situated near Dhangi Gate a lot more than 2 kilometres .
From there we went to see Ramnagar underneath .
There was a lot of evening while returning .
While leaving Delhi we decided that the lion will definitely see the lion roaming free in the jungle so that I could see the lion in the dream of the whole night .
In the darkness of the night I suddenly heard a terrible dawn and after that the dogs started roaming around which did n't stop for two hours .
Initially Kaladhungi and Corbett waterfalls were decided to be seen .
Kalatungi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett Fall is on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kalatungi where some important items related to his personal life have been kept .
It was twelve and a half by the time we returned .
Kalatungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this village itself .
On reaching the resort the safari zipsy was waiting for us .
It is said that he has arranged for signing in the Sight Business of one of the numbers there .
Considering a number they said that there is a lot of flies there and tigers come to protect themselves from the cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw several species of animals and deer there .
We saw two touching elephants inside which were long and long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
During this time the guide started trekking on the tiger .
Guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park some of which have died .
At some places we also saw the smell of their claws but I was disappointed because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
There was a tiger in my head .
Then I remembered a friend of mine of Haldani .
I made him hear the same phone .
I told him that I had come in carbonate .
Watching the tiger he asked .
His words look like arrows .
I said slowly , no .
There was no permission to take bikes in the park .
Someone told us that you take a safari to go inside .
