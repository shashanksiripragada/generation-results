On one side in the jungles of green mountains covered with forests on the other side is a deep gorge .
We had come to see tea gardens here forever .
There is a green empire all around .

Meaning one can go out for roaming Karsong with a vehicle .
First of all Tier Park .
A small garden is surrounded by jungles on all four sides .
The vehicle is very low for reaching from the top .
Although Karsingh is full of beauty , but now there is no fame of development in tourism .
However , the city is very good and clean .
The way to reach Tier Park despite being surrounded by forests is a joyous feeling for us to go through the path between greediness and sunshine .

Sometimes the consequences of this type are not present in Kalimpong .
We arrived at Darjeeling in the winters wherefrom from Chiligudi to Darjeeling the tea gardens spread till far and wide .
I felt very excited and thrilled by this small journey .
This journey is very near to Jaipur not only outside the country but also outside Rajasthan .
Tourists are thrilled in their own way in which when the journey draws towards itself then continuously a special place , water ship is being run or some city like a train or a rose garden or a lake palace of Udaipur .
People are getting attracted due to some special attraction .
I am telling you that the place was constructed about four and a half years ago , in reality this place has been decorated with forests .
Not only to go there but also to stay there .
My handkerchief in my ears reflected the words of Rambabu Meena . We could not imagine before this , then we live in the jungle .
50 percent workers are in this area .
Suddenly the people coming here do not get a job in the heritage hotel as well .
Ajabgarh resident Rambabu had previously worked in Jaipur and now it is in this magnificent and grand amazing Amman garden .
He gave himself a new form while talking .
Sahiba ' is an invaluable deposit of the Aman Garden .
Nobody invites you in English .
Aman Garden is actually a peaceful place and a tourist spot with all the facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it introduces its nearby areas .
To spend holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people roam around the bundles of flowers , why do they go far , only a few people of Jaipur may have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of the Aman Garden many people from within and outside reach there .
I remember that night when Sapna Ashmi had called me with interest but I could not go .
If they reach Panchet by finding out their own way then it is unique .
This time I realized by the invitation of my foreign guests that these people want to spend a good holiday in a short span of time so that there is a need to go to Aman Garden .
This garden is a different garden protected from those seven gardens where Alwar kings had gone for hunting .
Its construction was done in the 19th - 20th century .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Amber garden surrounded by mountains and under the shadow of dense trees makes you enjoy in the first place .
The way you come in the same way you are welcomed , it is said that you can enjoy the peaceful environment here .
Besides building a rope on the wrist the Mangalasar Mandir is pronounced very fast .
We reached Dolley in the evening and made a trip to that garden .
My guest Jackie was adorned with a lot of fun .
All the palaces and palaces were attracted to it including lighting .
Everything is beautiful .
It is not surprising that the Amman Garden has been given the award because all are modern artistic .
The manager gave our program for the morning .
We moved ahead with Babu and then traveled in jeep for Bangadh .
We saw the fort of Ajmer on the narrow road in which the sun was scattered gradually .
On seeing in the dry lake the peasant was growing in it .
This year due to no rains this year we had seen smoking farms for the first time .
The rural life of John was a unique experience of this kind .
After that we went to Bangkok by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist spot of Holland sitting carefully .
This is the priceless moment of millions of dollars .
From the Amnon garden it was a traditional form of Alvida which gave us jaggery and curd .
Now it is known why tourists come here to spend so much .
I am told that a tourist group has been formed to see the life of the tribals .
Is it right .
Certainly this is seen in some states and tourists show special interest in it .
This tourism is usually organised from 4 days to 2 weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
How to ate food to stay there .
This way an attempt is made to do such explanations where there is not much development and there is no special arrangement for the lifestyle of the nature and the people there .
Along with this old tourist places are also there .
Besides this paying attention to dried luggage is also given .
In reality the lifestyle and genetics of that place is seen directly for tourists who like tourism .
Although it is a bit difficult to imagine but such tourism is interesting and gives a different kind of experience .
It 's a lot of fun to go to the bus for tourism .
You can also enjoy touring here amidst crowds .
Not only this , during this journey you can take too much time to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with spending less and every time giving peace of mind this journey definitely keeps us satisfied .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you will be able to see foreign destination buses through tourism .
Look for a best team before taking a ticket .
There is an arrangement for both people to get tickets for students , militia , children etc .
Like this it is better to take a pre-packaged journey therefore it is better to arrange tourism on the last train and make arrangements for it beforehand .
They have to tell about the round trip instead of the ticket .
The cost of the morning starts decreasing .
It is very important to carry goods , therefore listen to the matter of obesity and weight .
You leave some of your products with termilk or you fill them with electromagnetic materials .
Immediately take the pleasure of insurance or loss from the tourism department .
Take calorie on packs very convenient .
Because it can be put on a rock above the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the luggage from the bus during tourism the responsibility of tourism is on its own .
Wherever you have a bus go take one hour before that time .
During the busy season you can keep this matter in a special period .
Actually the sooner you will go the better seat system will be near you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the convenience .
Take the rear side also , but it is not easy to read in the front seat .
If you have frequent urination then take a long urination , if you do not want to face much trouble then the urinary bladder near the door is excellent for you .
Now there is a trick .
If you both sit in the seat of the seat then first sit in the seat of the corner and then keep your pack on the other side .
Therefore if there is not much crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore if you have the facility of brushing then take care of this point while choosing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after a while .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get sufficient information .
Everybody gets out while cleaning the bus .
During this you should not keep the orange on the pit because if it is lost people who are in danger do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops go for a while .
But if you do not go on time then you can see a new passenger at your place and you will have to expect another bus terminus .

But when this earth becomes a challenge for a rare creation then such terror is impossible .
Some people very well know the magnificence of the people reaching inside the water through the cabinet of Maldives in October because how impossible is the world to get rid of the nature ' s anger .
The beauty there is slightly different from this .

Good luck that day should have been special .
In the morning a boat from Guruji reached our airport Jalandhar .
From there we reached the destination of Trans Maldives by roaming around in Ranway .

We were watching all his maps .
But then there was no doubt that the next day there was a chance to pay attention to it .
We had to go to Rangali Island at a distance of 500 kilometres from Shillong of Trans Maldives .
Cannon is unforgettable due to hundreds of rhinoceros and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the cannon flying till the height of approximately 1000 metres .

We reached a glass room after climbing down several metres down the stairs , which was in the water .
That half was actually a meal room .

For a long time we had planned to go to Waliyu from Delhi but due to being busy in work this did not happen .
Because of being interested in the wildlife of the child why do not we think of going to Jim Corbett this time .
After packing till Yegong lake some distance from Kardukla pass in Laddakh in 2006 this was the second packet .
In the early morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but due to the rush of exit we decreased our speed .
The journey between Haboot and Kaziranga was really tired .
Snow from the top and worse road from the front .
Several times it appears that when they are falling .
Once we reached Garjraula at 8 in the morning .
We had just arrived at Ramnagar at 12 .
Corbett Park is at a distance of some 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Diu near the park , which we had already registered .
Today there is no special program therefore after getting cold we went to roam on the shore of Kosi .
After two - three hours we went to the Corbett Museum which was very difficult at a distance of two kilometres near the circumambulation path .
From there we went to see Ramnagar a few days back .
It took us a long time to return .
It was decided that if we see the tiger left in the jungle then we got to see tiger in the entire night .
During the dark nights I suddenly heard a loud voice , after that the dogs started screaming and did not stand for two hours .
This is why Kaladongi and Corbett falls first on the way .
There was a museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kaladeng , where some items related to personal life were kept .
Museum of Jim Corbett Island in Kala Tungi .
It was half past seven o'clock in the morning .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village only .
On reaching at the hotel Safari i . . had waited for our arrival .
He told us that there is arrangement of roaming around on the one side of the road in Bijrani .
When we asked about the number one then the tigers used to come here for the preservation of the cold .
On reaching Bijarali we got a guide , for roaming around for four hours we took a hundred and fifty rupees .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
There many types of animals and monkeys were seen .
Inside we saw two pairs of elephants , which had long teeth .
I took the film by standing .
In the meanwhile the guide started trekking on Philippe .
There are about 150 tigers in the park among which some tigers have died in one year .
We saw their footsteps at several places but I was sorry that we could not see the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a decrease in the number of tigers that was not visible .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I telephoned him.
I told him that I had come to Corbett .
I asked him whether he had seen the tiger or not .
His words sounded like arrows .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take a pack in the park .
One told us that for going inside take a shovel .
