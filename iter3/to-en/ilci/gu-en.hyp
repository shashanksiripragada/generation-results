Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
Sindhu on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other side therefore there is a mixture of both in language .
This is called ' kutchi ' .
As such this ' Boli ' is not its own script .
If you have to write Kutch then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near the ground is that Anjar city where several times earthquakes have occurred and the whole city has been devastated .
The tomb of Jaisalmer Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer is very interesting .
If we come by the same route from where we had come then we will have to take a full month 's breakfast and on this side school will be opened in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now tour the railways by taking fast buses of Gujarat .
A small train of metre gauge from Bhubaneswar will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
Considering the main base of the economy of Rajasthan the tourism industry is passing through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and increasing danger in South Asia tourism industry has started to suffer a lot .
With regard to tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been recorded very less these days .
The latest figures announced recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent decrease in the number of foreign tourists has come .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists had come to Rajasthan in 2008 , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included , whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 72 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countrymen and ten lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Holiday Makers of Rajput has said that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have influenced tourism industry completely .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong base of tourism there .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
From the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
According to tourism the recent years have been better for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , Haveli , Fort , Vau Forest everything is old for serving the tourists .
In the tourism sector the government does the work on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
There along with foreign lady tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of rape and assault have also made the image of this state a challenge at international level .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state years back but it has remained contiguous with the newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1987 with the goal of boosting tourism and developing the basic infrastructure of tourism in Rajasthan .
This corporation provides the facilities of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 barrels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one vehicle unit and two trains Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has also been spoilt for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that even in the last five years their hotels did not have 40 percent rooms .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it big mistakes .
The main among these are the Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
This railway could not become the attraction of tourists .
Despite less fares this can not attract tourists .
In the same way in recent years there has been a dearth of tourists towards Pushkar fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC this year the number decreased to 217 .
The satisfaction of RTDC between all this is that there is no dearth of the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Rail Transport .
This railway is continuously bringing benefits .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
Located in the area of tourism in Rajasthan this deficiency is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of Rajasthan 's economy .
If the person has the desire to do something in his heart then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has fulfilled it by establishing modern city Amboveli in the mountain ranges of compassion for Maharashtra .

Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
This is called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is located in the midst of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the popular stories here this place is Vidarbha where once king Bhishmak ruled .

Besides the aforesaid ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal , the ruins of roaming in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical significance .
The ruins of the brick pond near Roing are still narrating their stories .

We reach ero from four hours through jeep from North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where you people live .
It took several days for the jeep to reach here before the path was made .
On reaching here the views of high - high cedar trees , beautiful premieres , walnuts , wild buffaloes , strawberries and raspberry overwhelm the tourists .
Apple and cardamom are produced a lot here .
At a height of about 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people of our country .
With its untiring hard work the people of our country have made it their heaven .
There is abundance of rice cultivation here .
This place is the reserve of rice .
This ten miles long surface is a living example of their hard work and the skill of farming .
Its necessity of irrigation gets fulfilled with Kali Nadi .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
Eyes fall on the horizon in the rhythmic redness rising in the sky in the middle of the snowy mountain ranges of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
Along with the cool breeze in the environment one also gets the feeling of moisture .
The sound of trash below the legs is seen a sheet of snow spread on the surface of the wood .
Nervousness occurs in the environment and because of blurredness before sunrise nothing was seen more .
Eyes become stable on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on a rock lying in a cave .
As soon as the hand is attached , the dark circles of the palm gets twisted with the sound of simple garbage and the hands get separated from the jerk by the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village amidst these mountains buried in the snow of Switzerland .
This is my third trip to Swiss .
Before this a lot of time was spent in Geneva or nearby .
On both the sides of the small flowing river and the dense valleys situated in the valley is spread on the simple slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland , Rhone valley on both the sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The highway on the other side of the Ron river and the vehicles running on it appear clear .
At a distance of 300 kilometres and a half an hour journey by car the parallel of Geneva lake and half a roan river along with half the roan river in the eastern direction is found in the Geneva lake near the city named Montro which is called Lock Large in Fench .
Geneva city is situated on the western part of this lake 100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide .
From there the lake again moves towards the west after becoming a river .
On the left side is Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps mountain range crossing the Sarwar .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke on the left side exit we leave this highway and go to the mountainous roads of the north .
Because of the slope of the mountain being south facing all the corners of the afternoon sun is giving abundant heat .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here . almost like that .
As we move towards height , the density of snow starts increasing .
Despite good snow falling on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After completing a journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular mountainous road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Chalet slopes are full of slanting , large , multi-storied bugyals made of wood .
In the fountain built with the cement cocktail of the three storey bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , washing and parking of cars .
Valaya is famous for grapes farming in Switzerland .
This alcohol is the main center of making grapes of grapes .
37 percent land of the entire cantonment is cultivated by grapes .
The grapes of grapes in the villages located on both sides of the Ron Valley provide a magnificent expanse of the beauty there .
Travelling till the grapes garden , taking a dinner in the villages there and drunk in the liquor shops is an integral part of tourism business here .
In a small village named earlier there is a very big museum of grapes in a fort built in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to register .
Once again we descended from the middle of that very jungle having descended from Dawal .
Mind becomes very distressed by the questions that happen to children on three - four kilometres road .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes come in sight in one glance .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley towards the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on a flat slope from above the village .
There is dense forest of cedar till the top of the mountain above the skiing slope .
Snow has fallen all around .
The roofs of the houses of the population are shining because of the falling of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Peace is spread here as well .
From the peak of the mountains on all the four sides to the valley the kingdom of white snow .
Within five minutes ahead we reach a big round circular path in the middle of that village .
The name of the town is Lukarbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lukurabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and health workers coming here can be estimated from this thing that here there are 1700 apartments with a capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping site of tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants for staying .

On reaching the village a feeling of complete heat is felt .
In scorching heat a large sheet of snow is glittering on the roofs of houses .
The name of albinin is of this village .
Albanian village is one of the ' conserved as a national heritage ' in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can go only to Sikkim 's taxis , therefore there is no test .
The journey is ongoing , the region is second , but the mountain is that only , the trees and plants are the same .
The moisture accumulated on the whole body is the same .
In the weather of rains blue color is the same .
On completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey I got the decision to see Karsingh first .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , completely covered with the jungle of Dhupi .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
When we moved towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning itself tea gardens are swimming and welcomed to come towards us .
Passing through the road in the middle of the tea gardens attracts hearts the first time .
On one side is a green mountain filled with jungles , and on the other side a deep green valley .
On this side sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are visible .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I fell in a state of unease , see these natural jungles with tea plantations planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
As beautiful as a wilderness , so beautiful tea gardens spread far and wide .
If one glances on the roads on the way then the scene looks marvellous .
The circular and circular ways of the snakes were passing through .
Time was also passing .
If they did not pass then wilderness and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements start forming .
From a distance a hill appeared very dense from houses and houses .
This was Kursingh .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming the whole day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we set out on a tour of Kurseong .
First of all , Dier Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests on all four sides .
To reach the deer park from above the vehicle had to leave very low .
Even after being enchanted by the beauty of Karsingh I could not become famous in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and the enjoyment of walking amidst the pine trees was giving us the pleasure of thrill .
The place ahead was Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suside point .
It is said that during the reign of the British people used to give life by hiding themselves from here .
Now , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a staircase here , from the height of which on observing the entire city a beautiful sight is seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women were immersed in breaking the palanquins on their backs , tea gardens running with great speed .
There is a museum outside the Corbett city on which we could not go there that day , because it was very necessary to tour the free environment of this garden .
The next day Darjeeling had decided to tour .
This was a thrilling experience in itself , but there was a bigger concern than this as to how would we return if it had rained .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching till Rock Garden we enjoyed the blooming heat .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with wide rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than that .
Going a little below from here we met Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The view of waterfalls amidst the wide rocks from here is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we saw that in the empire of rocks wide rocks there is a splendor of waterfalls then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya is enriched with rocks .
Both of these places are very low in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling climbing up with the help of a car .
The whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was clean till now .
But where we headed towards the monastery , there was a hustle-bustle as if from where we were present and began to shine .
In the evening a tour and shopping was organised on the Mall Road .
In the tour of Darjeeling toy train enhances the joy of journey .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to Mussoorie and from Kumaun to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in the Mirik lake and some rest in the garden here .
From this route only tourists go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where handmade sweaters of Nepali workers are found .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its colors are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , but the commutation of forests and waterfalls is there .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are - Ladakh and Lolegaon which are filled with jungle waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for a stroll in the shadow of cold , but the tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling stopped me here .
A small journey of my recent past was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor of Rajasthan , but very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , ship of water or some city like a royal train or a pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people start walking barefoot .
The place I am going to talk about is ready just four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place is situated there , that has actually been deserted in the jungle .
Not only for the people going there , but also for the people staying there .
My guide Rambabu Meena resonates in my ear , Sahiba could not even imagine before that that we could stay in the jungle like this .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Ajabgarh resident Rambabu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now this unique royal family is in Amn Bagh .
He had put his walking in a new color .
Sahiba ' is the prediction of Aman Bagh .
There no one would call you English words .
Aman Bag is a real peaceful and comfortable tour of all .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the nearby areas as well .
In the royal style of Rajasthan some people must have toured the Bhangarh of the royals .
After the opening of Aman garden big people of the country and abroad have gone there .
I remember that night also when Shabana Azmi had called me there with a taluka but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh forgetting the road .
This time suddenly when I reached there at the invitation of my foreign guests then I felt that those people who want to spend a splendid holiday in a short span of time they should definitely go to Aman Bag .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to sit for hunting .
Its construction was done in the nineteenth century .
Its old walls are the witnesses of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Bagh attracts you .
The way you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it appears that attention has been paid to divine peace here .
Along with tying cloth in the wrist a living pronunciation of the mantra of Mangalacharya is done .
We had reached in the evening and thought of going in front of that garden .
My guests who were decorating a decorative voice suddenly said . This is delicate ' .
All are inspired by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bag got the award recently .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all a pedestrian journey with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was expanding gradually .
We saw dry lakes in which peasants were farming .
This year it did n't rain but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For which such a miracle of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh from Jeep .
In the morning - evening I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollar precious moment .
The way to call Aman Bag was traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they made us leave .
Now it has been understood why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that for showing tribe life also tour packages are kept .
Is this right .
Besides this there is one or the other states and tourists also show a lot of interest in them .
This journey is usually prepared from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Eating etc . is also included in it .
This way there is an attempt to discover such places where there is not much development and where there is no effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where ancient tourist spots etc . are also present .
Besides this , conventional cousin serving is also taken care of .
Actually the purpose of such tourism is to make tourists experience the lifestyle and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such travels are actually thrilling and gives a different kind of experience .
Just tourism has its own fun .
Despite this having many people together you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time without your favorite book .
Yes , it is necessary that along with spending a lot of time and peaceful travellers keep a demand for your patience .
This is the reason that to accept this some things have to be kept in mind , especially then , some foreign place is going with the help of bus tourism .
Get a good package checked up before taking a ticket .
Students , senior citizens of the army , children etc get a discount on this , then there is arrangement of relaxation for two people also .
Otherwise , it is cheaper to buy tickets from before , therefore in the last moments instead of fixing the bus journey it is better to do the plan a little before .
Get information about circular journey without ticket on both sides .
This falls cheap .
Regular rules are for luggage hence ask for size and weight of luggage .
It should not be such that you have to leave your luggage at the station or you have to pay a heavy fee .
Also enquire about insurance or compensation for loss from the travel company .
The bags to keep with them are appropriate , take them along .
Because above this seat properly comes in the horse .
Also keep in mind that during the journey while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods will be on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the upcoming season you will be able to take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach the better seat you will have .
While fixing the seat keep in mind the convenience .
If there will be more jerk at the last seat , then it will not be right to read at the front seat .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to face much trouble then the window seat will be suitable for you .
Now it is a matter of cunning .
If you are in a fray of two seats then sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then while fixing the seat keep this thing in mind , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make an identity with a bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat , because they do not take the responsibility of losing it .
Wherever the bus stops go back on time .
If you do not come in time , then you can find some new characters in your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .
It is said that if we did not see Rome in Europe then we did not see anything .

If seen on today 's date then for Maldives the fare of returning from Delhi to the cheapest person is of 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Malaysia and still you can get hotels on less rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the actual beauty of Malli then the pocket will be small .
Sea powder proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December the cruise loose from Kochi started the single sea cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Fort is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some reasons Louis Cruise has still kept his services intact , but from October it is likely to happen again .
You can go on a trip to Maldives for a three day breakfast at least 5850 rupees per person per night on the ship MV Aquamerin of Louis Corbett .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two elders then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What should be the second one
Tea , breakfast , food all are included in the fares of Paris .
With entertainment of all times .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives in Maldives in accordance with your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a sea plane is standing in front of you roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel like playing games .
But this twin otter plane with 12 - 15 seats is excellent in an uninterrupted way to tour the group of islands like Malwa .
Running like a speed boat on the surface of water when it gets in the air , it does not come to know .
In the whole of the flight you do not have the feeling of the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your sight remains below the window , resort islands and coral islands are visible in the blue water of different shadows of Malwa .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Tros Mallian is one of them near which is sea plane .
If you want you can travel by air for about four thousand rupees -LRB- seventy -RRB- an hour or you can take the whole sea plane on rent for your day long tour -LRB- really the big pocket -RRB- .
If you go to any island before Male Island then the journey of Sea Plane will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you might never feel like completing .
Sea plane takes a journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the best way Mavilleva -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the capital ' s oldest and memorable shop in the Ahmadi market of Male .
People selling all were listening very carefully to the speech given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed in the World Heritage Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
Honestly I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of Presidents or Prime Ministers so closely .
But when there was a question of the existence of an excellent creation of this earth then this much seriousness was required .
Many people might have considered the meeting done inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October but after going to Maldives it feels as if the wrath of nature has snatched it away from us then how much will the world be
Something like this is special in its beauty .
As if in this small country there is not so much beauty .
After returning from that journey of the market when we came towards the jetty to go back to our pockets then we realized how far the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that fishes floating in depths of several metres under the light of Lamp Post were appearing with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you can see some centimetres clearly in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India then you will find yourself nervous .
While returning to M . . Aquarius Mal was roaming around in the brain for two hours in the evening .
Coral reef -LRB- rocks of perimeter -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones hanging on the tombs you will find rocks of crowns .
We were standing outside their official residence a few moments before listening to the speech of President Nasrida .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the best personality of any country , there was no security worker far and wide .
With pleasure we were taking pictures of gardens and parrots spreading our hands inside the gates of their bungalows for about 50 metres .
Can you think of the house of a common leader in India like this
It was also known that the President sometimes crossed the road on foot and reached his office two blocks ahead .
Everything was surprising about Malwa .
That is why I was eager to wait for the next day .
It was known that the day was about to be special .
In the morning a boat took us to Airport Island from Kathgodam .
From there we reached on the verge of the runway on the verge of the Trans Mountain .
Last evening when we were reaching near the Mall , we immediately recognized the sea plane passing through it .
He had seen such pictures.
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of a ride in it .
We had to go to Rangali Island one hundred and fifty kilometres away from the sea plane of the Tros Mallians .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands lying in the sea of Maldives from sea plane flying at a height of approximately a thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a thrilling flight of thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel on the Rangali Island it felt as if we have reached some other world .
In such a world , which has no relation with any outside world .
Relationship was not in such a way that it was difficult to get out of beauty or adventure .
Walking on foot on the Konark can also be done or by a battery operated car .
On both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island the view of life is unique .
Today we were unable to listen to ourselves by the nature nearby , it was unimaginable to reach such a place .
After descending in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides of the glass we were able to see unique types of small and big fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving people .
The imagination of food sitting on a decorated table there was in itself very thrilling .
The fare of visiting and underwater lunch on this island in Male to Sea Plane is 47 thousand rupees for a single person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to dwell in the water of our Parvati .
But they knew that it was not possible .
To return with this desire with a heavy heart , once again , at some point of view , intoxication will definitely be taken here .
Since many days they were planning to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
If there was a hobby of wildlife since childhood then why should not this time go to Jim Corbett
After biking till Pegong pond ahead of Khardungla in Ladakh in 2006 this was the second like tour .
On the afternoon of 27 December we had to leave for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the moment we got out of jeopardy , dumbfounded our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Dhoomas from top and bad road from front .
It seemed many times that it was now lying down .
After doing anything we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Although we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Amra was in Dhikuli near the Reservoir Park itself , which we had already got enrolled .
That day there was no special program but we came to roam on the bank of Kosi before it was cold .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres near Dhangdi gate .
From there we kept going to visit Ramnagar below .
It was evening walking back .
It was decided from Delhi that if I had seen lions roaming free in the jungle then I had seen lions all night .
I suddenly felt a lot of roar in the middle of a deep night and after that the dogs who started sneezing would not stop for two hours .
Therefore it was suggested to visit Kala Dhungi and Corbett waterfalls .
Kaladhangi is at a distance of thirty kilometres , when Corbett waterfall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladhangi , where some important things related to his life are kept .
We were twelve o'clock in the morning .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett has come to this village only .
Safari jeepsy while reaching the resort were waiting for us .
It was told that they had got the arrangement of sighting in the number one side bidder there .
Asked about number one , we said that the grassy land there is more and during this time tigers come towards it to prevent cold .
On reaching Bijara we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We went inside for a jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had long teeth .
I photographed properly .
In the midst of this the guide started following the tiger .
The guide said that in the park there are around 150 tigers , some of them have died recently .
At many places we also saw signs of his footsteps but due to no visit to the tiger I was sad .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind the past of the tiger was in the morning .
Then I remembered the old friend of Haldwani .
I made that phone call .
I told him that I am at Corbett .
He asked whether the tiger had seen or not .
His words were played like arrows .
I said gradually , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody gave us the advice that you take safari for inside .
