Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
Sindh on one side of Kutch and Gujarat on the other is therefore a mixture of both in language .
This is called ' kachhi ' .
Well it ' s a dialect , it ' s not its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the whole city has collapsed .

The tourism industry , which is considered to be the mainstay of the economy of Rajasthan , is going through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and rising terrorist threats in South Asia tourism industry has been shocked .
With the point of view of tourism a considerable reduction has been seen in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan from the major states of the country these days .
The latest figures released recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
These included two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 native and one lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday Makers says that worldwide recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected the tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan , the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With respect to tourism , recent years have passed the best for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , bawaris , forest everything is that old which is for the tourists to enjoy .
In the area of tourism all the governments do the work of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time in recent years incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists have also stained the image of this state at an international level .
Years before the Rajasthan Government had given tourism the status of industry in the state but it has remained confined to papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) is an example of the success of the Rajasthan Government towards tourism .
Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 with the objective of promoting tourism and developing tourism infrastructure .
This corporation provides facilities for housing , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The RTDC deficit in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels in this corporation is that even in the last five years forty percent of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also bringing it a big loss .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attracted towards this train .
Despite less rent this could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the tourist village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed this year the number decreased to 217 .
Amidst all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC has been that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This railway is continuously benefiting .
Last year, RTDC got the benefit of Rs. 9.5 crore from this train.
Due to this fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If one wants to do something in the heart of man , he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by establishing modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dream he had dreamt of seeing him progressing day by day , gives him happiness in his eyes .
His joy was also seen at the time of the opening of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place as an excellent city .
Spread on more than 10 , 000 acres in this city hotels , houses and other facilities have been made available on only 9  land .
Trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available on 91 percent land .
Several industrialists came forward to build their own houses in this city built for millionaires and today there are about 800 families living in this city .
Initially , industrialists and nobles bought their home here in the form of holiday home , but now they have made it their first home and from here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Embay Valley itself is the Koyarigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this place .
The ruins of Likawali in the western Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the pillars of stones of this temple excavations of lotus and goddesses have been obtained which are mostly in a state of ruins .

A decorated idol of Goddess Durga has been found at this place .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet tales and old tales are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious saga of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreeshwari Devi obtained from these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the glory of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the time of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was recognized far and wide .
The tribe here used to worship the goddess .
Human sacrifice was also offered here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the midst of the Dibang and Divang rivers .
According to the stories prevalent here this place is the old Vidarbha , where once king Bhishmak ruled .
The Brahmakunda is located in the lower part of the Lohit river , a famous place in the Lohit district .
The tribes of Deegaru , Mishmi etc . here guide the travellers .
These people themselves have great respect for this kunda .
Near Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described as the pilgrimage places of Arunachal , the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The relics of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their stories .
Surrounded by bathing ghats , pucca stairs and other ponds , getting relics of wide roads is still singing silent songs of its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from four hours through jeep from North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise tourists .
This is that charming place where there is an emergency .
It used to take several days to reach here before the jeep was formed .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premieres , walnuts , wild currents , strawberries and rasberries overwhelm the tourists .
Apples and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the home of emergency people .
With their tireless hard work , the emergency people have made it their heaven .
The cultivation of rice is very good here .
This place is the store of rice .
This ten miles long plateau is a living example of their hard work and their skill in cultivation .
Their irrigation needs are met by the Kali river .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the horizontal slightly shining redness rising in the sky in the middle of the snowy mountain ranges of the left hand .
It is very cool in the air .
Along with the pricking cold you also feel moisture in the atmosphere .
The sound of litter below the legs is seen on the layer of wood fixed on the floor .
There is dullness in the atmosphere and there is no more visible because of the shadow of sunrise .
Eyes remain lying on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on a bench in a balcony .
As soon as the hand touches the smooth layer of the palms shines with the sound of a mild curtain and the hand separates from the shock by the feeling of cold .
This is the first experience of spending the night in this small village settled amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland thousands of miles away from our country .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent in Geneva or nearby .
The densely populated population on either side of the thin stream of Balakhati river is spread very high on slopes .
This is the valley of Rhone , the main river of Switzerland on both the sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
Parallel highways of Ron river and cars of crawling on them have begun to give clearance .
A journey of 300 kms and half an hour from the car adjoining parallel to the Geneva lake and half a roan river at the same time near the city named Ron river Montreu which is called ' Dec emon ' -LRB- Lock Lama -RRB- is found in French .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again turns into a river and moves towards the west .
There are mountain ranges of Dhawal , skyscrapers across the lake on the right .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Leuke we reach the mountainous way of the north , leaving this highway on the exit -LRB- it -RRB- on the left .
As the slope of the mountain is towards the south , the sun of the afternoon is giving a lot of sunshine to all the fans .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of ice is less here - almost equal .
As we move towards the height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good snow being frozen on both sides of the road there is no special coolness in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
After covering a journey of about 20 kms on this curved hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thel .
Halet - There are large multi - storied bungalows with slopy roofs , fully wooden .
In the basement built of the cement concrete of this three storied bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , ladder etc . along with parking of trains .
Valay is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes of grapes .
Grapes are cultivated in 37  of the land of the entire Canton .
In the villages settled on both sides of the Ron Valley the gardens of grapes present a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking the bottom of grapes , getting them traveled , resting in the night in the villages there and taking them to the factories of grapes wine testing is an integral part of tourism business here .
In a small town named Aizawl there is a big museum of grapes in a chatti made in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to make an artificial booking .
Once again we pass through the middle of that jungle which was buried with the cavalry .
Mind becomes even more distressed by the prickly questions of children throughout the way up to three - four kms .
Suddenly , at a turn , the scene brings about dramatic and charming changes .
Right in front , on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful herd of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on a flat slope from above the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
Dense snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining due to the falling of direct rays of the sun .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also the same silence is spread .
From the peak of the mountain all around to the valley the empire of white snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a large round about in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
The population of Leukarabad located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and healthy people coming here can be estimated from this point that here there are 1700 apartments and halts with a capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels for staying in 1500 , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
In Leukarabad , 65 sleeves of hot water have been found till now .
4 million litres ( upto 51  - per day ) coming out of these , the whole town of water is transported to about 30 small and big thermal pools , some pools are within five star hotels and others according to the pockets of people of different income groups .
On reaching the village a feeling of extreme heat is felt .
The thick layer of snow is shining above the roofs of the houses in the bright sunshine .
Albenin -LRB- Albenin -RRB- name of this village .
Albanian village is one of the preserved places in Switzerland in the form of a heritage of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxis , therefore there is no checking .
Travellers continue , the region may be different , but the mountains are the same , trees and plants are the same , the rough winds are there .
He is the moisture all over the body .
The sunrise in the rainy season is the same .
As soon as the plan for the journey to Darjeeling was confirmed , the sight of Karsiang was first spread .
Kurseong is a small town in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , complete with sunny jungles .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we moved towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning itself the tea gardens welcome the people moving towards it with a smile .
Passing through the roads amidst the tea gardens hypnotise hearts in the very first time .
On one side is a green mountain full of forests , on the other side a deep green trench .
Sometimes jungles and tea gardens were visible here .
There was a greenery empire all around .
Once upon a time I got upset , see these natural jungles or the tea planted by man .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The beautiful forest was as beautiful as tea gardens spread far and wide .
If we glance at the streets on the way then the creation looks marvellous .
The crooked and circular way of the snake was passing .
Time was passing .
If not , then the forest and the tea garden .
Sometimes a small settlement is seen .
From a distance , a hilly house , etc . appeared very dense .
It was cursory .
Staying at a place here we made a program of roaming the whole day .
Hence we set out on a tour of Kurseong with a car .
First of all , Dire Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests .
To reach the top of the ascent i . . deer park the car had to be left very low .
Kurseong , irrespective of its beauty , has not yet been known as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the path being deserted the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing the path amidst the sunny trees was giving us the joy of climbing .
The next place was the Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to jump and die from here .
At present , it is equipped with a park and a restaurant .
There is a staircase like dome here , from the height of which a beautiful view is seen when the whole city is seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women were engrossed in breaking the tea gardens running around with a basket loaded on their backs .
Cursing is a museum outside the city , but that day we could not go there , because it was more necessary to tour the free environment of tea gardens .
The next day Darjeeling was scheduled to roam .
This was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was very worrisome as to how would we roam if it had been raining .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching till Rock Garden we enjoyed the bright sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining .
On moving a little more than here we found Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The illusion of waterfalls amidst rocks here is worth seeing .
We found in Rock Garden that if waterfalls are adorned in the kingdom of rocks and rocks then the miraculous world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is affluent with stones .
Both of these places are located very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of a car we saw a balustrade loop in Darjeeling .
The whole of the hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of telescope .
The temperament of the weather was still nice .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , where did we come down and glittered
In the evening plans were made for strolling and shopping on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling the train enhances by four folds the journey .
Travelling from Darjeeling to Darjeeling and the journey from Dhume to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake here and short break in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is also a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but the flow of the jungles and waterfalls is there .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata , to roam Darjeeling in the shade of coolness , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me with itself .
My recent short journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like a pink city or the Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come to the fore .
The place I am going to talk about has been prepared approximately four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come here has actually turned into jungles .
Not only for those who go there , but also for those who stay there .
My guide resonates in my ears the words of Ram Babu Meena : ' Sahib , we couldn ' t even imagine before that we could live in the forest like this .
Fifty percent staff belong to this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people didn ' t even get a job at the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajbgarh , used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He has turned his own speech into a new colour .
Sahiba ' is the style of Aman Garden .
There no one calls you from English .
Aman Bag is really a peaceful and comfortable tourist destination .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the nearby areas as well .
How many people among the people living in the royal style of Rajasthan might have toured Bhangarh of the past , why should I go away , even some among the Jaipurites might have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman garden big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there with a lot of heart , but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had gone astray to Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there at the feast of my foreign guests , then it felt that those who want to spend a splendid holiday in a short span of time they should definitely go to Aman Garden .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
It was built in nineteen , twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by hills and in the shade of dense trees the first glimpse of Aman Garden charms you .
As soon as you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it seems that here divine peace has been paid attention .
The mantra of Mangalachara is lively pronounced as soon as the wrist is tied .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we intended to plant a garden .
My host Jackie , a gentleman , suddenly said , It ' s interesting .
All are inspired by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic  no wonder that Aman Garden has also received prizes recently .
The manager decided our programme for the morning .
First of all a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey to Bhangarh .
On walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of sun was spreading gradually .
He saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
For Jackie such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning and evening I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are million dollars precious moments .
The way of saying goodbye to Aman Bagh was also traditional , he sent us away by feeding jaggery and curd .
Now we understood why the tourist comes here after spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept for showing Tribal Life .
what this is right .
Of course this is not the same in many states and tourists also show great interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It includes staying there , food etc .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places where there has not been much development and where time has not had much impact on nature and lifestyle of people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this , paying attention to serving a triditional key is also given .
Actually the purpose of such tours is to make the tourists aware of the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite having a lot of people with it you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to your favorite book without being disturbed .
Yes , it is very important that along with spending a lot of time and comfortable time these tours definitely keep a demand for patience with you .
This is the reason that for enjoying these it is important to keep in mind some things especially when you are watching some foreign destination bus terminus through tour .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , senior officers of the military , children etc get a discount on them , then there is an arrangement of discount for two people as well .
By the way , it is cheaper to buy tickets in advance , so it is better to plan a bus tour in the last moments than do a little ahead .
to find out about the round trip instead of the ticket .
They are cheap .
The rules regarding the baggage are very tough , therefore inquire about the size and weight of the goods .
It may not be such that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or you have to pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensation for insurance or loss from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , take them .
because they fit in the rack over the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus you will have the responsibility of luggage on your own .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the busy season you should take special care of this point .
Actually the sooner you reach the better seat option will be with you .
While choosing a seat take care of the conferencing .
If there are more tremors in the previous seat , it is not conferred to read in the next seats .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , take the corner seat and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the window seat will be better for you .
Now it ' s a trick .
If you are both in a hurry , then sit in the corner seat and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then keep in mind this thing while chewing the seat , because after some time sitting there becomes difficult .
Make identification by bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because when it is lost the bus do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then a new passenger can find your place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .

The special attractions of Rome are its fountains .
Here there are approximately 300 buildings in which spectacular fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevy Fountain ' .

On the other hand your journey to Pune is incomplete without seeing the famous Osho Ashram of Saturday Wada and Bhagwan Rajneesh , the palace of the Peshwa rulers .
There are two hotels of Ginger in Pune which are located in Pimpri and Wakad .
Situated at the center of Pimpri Industrial Region and on the Pune - Bangalore highway both the hotels of Ginger built in a place called Wakad are equipped with all the modern facilities .
The neighbor state of Maharashtra Goa is contiguous with its beautiful sea shores and diverse water sports which is like a heaven for tourists where one easily gets to see the grandeur of ancient times through the tour of ancient churches .
Situated in the capital of Goa , Panjim the Ginger Hotel makes this journey of the western coast excellent .
Taking full enjoyment of cycling , river cruise , cold sea breeze and world famous cruise on the roads of Goa the Ginger Hotel located here is the best option to spend a comfortable day .
If seen in today 's date then the cheapest person return from Delhi for Maldives is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Mala then you can get hotels on a little fare but if you go to an island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then your pocket will be small .
C cruise proves beneficial here .
In the first week of December , Louis Cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise cruise for the Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is well known in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Louis cruise has postponed its services but it is expected to start again from October .
On Louis cruise ship MV Aquamarin you can go for a tour of Maldives for a three day cruise at a rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person .
That is , the fare of a person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two grow older children under the age of 15 are absolutely free .
and what else .
The cruise fares include tea , snacks , food .
Entertainment of every time together .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If suddenly a plane stands in front of you while roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel like a toy .
But this twin otter plane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent for roaming Archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives in an undisputed way .
Running like a speed boat on the surface of water it does not know when it gets up in the air .
In the entire flight you do not have the experience of flying airplanes .
Every time your eyes gaze at below the window - watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
How clear is everything .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Tras Maldives is one of them which has twenty c planes .
If you want you can take a flight of around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- an hour or the whole sea plane can take you on rent for a trip throughout your day -LRB- provided the pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go to an island beyond Male Island then it will be necessary for you to travel a sea plane because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that ' s a journey that might never end up with you .
Sea plane takes a journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- the best way to Mavilevaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the capital ' s largest antique and sovenier shop in the Ahmadi market of Male .
All salesmen were listening very carefully to the speech delivered in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed .
To tell honestly , I have not seen any Indian woman listening to the speeches of presidents or prime minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of an unprecedented creation of this earth , it was so serious .
Many people might have considered the meeting done inside water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but going to Maldives it feels as if if the wrath of nature snatches it from us then how impoverished will the world be .
There is something special in its beauty .
In that small country it seemed as if it was not so beautiful .
Returning from that stroll of the market to go back to its cruise while returning to the jetty , when the eyes went in the waters of the sea along with the bushes of the road then we realized to what extent people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that in the light of the lamppost the fish floating in depths of several metres were visible with all its colours .
It was part of the sea that was very close to the city .
You will find yourself lucky if you can see even a few centimetres clean in the sea or river water adjacent to any city of India .
While returning to M . V . Aquamarin , he spent two hours in the evening in the garland .
Coral reef -LRB- muga rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will find muga rocks on the stones attached to the graves .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security guard till far .
Interestingly we were taking photographs of gardens and verandahs just fifty metres away by stretching our hands inside from the door of his bungalow .
Can you think of a leader ' s house in India
It was also known that presidents sometimes went to their office two blocks ahead crossing roads on foot .
Everything was surprising about the Maldives .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
Ilham was supposed to be a special day .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached on the base of the Trans Maldives while roaming around the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near the Mall then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing above .
His pictures that he saw .
But then there was no guess that the next day there would be a ride .
We were about to go to Rangali Island , one hundred and five kilometres away from the C plane of the Tros Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying till the height of approximately thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a breathtaking flight with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel on the island of Rangali it seemed as if we had reached some other world .
In a world that had no meaning in any outside world .
It was not like this that it was difficult to get the beauty or luxury out there as well .
Walking on Konark can also be done on foot or by a battery operated car .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was unique .
Right now we could not even comfort ourselves with the natural beauty nearby , it was unimaginable that we had reached such a place .
Several meters below the stairs while descending into the sea water we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides crossing the mirrors we could see the unique types of small fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating and drinking on decorated tables was very exciting in itself .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch on this island in sea plane from Male is 47 thousand rupees for a man .
I did not want to return from there .
We were ready to shed our passports in water .
But he knew it was not possible .
With a heavy heart we returned with the same expectation that at some point of time fate will surely bring here .
For many days he was planning to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Wildlife was a hobby since childhood then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour in 2006 after the biking of Pegong Lake ahead of Khardungla Pass in Ladakh .
In the early morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the fog that had come out of the hustle-bustle rushed our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
Fog from above and bad road in front .
Sometimes it seemed that he had fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already got booked .
That day there was no special program , we went to roam the edge of Kosi even though it was cold .
After spending two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum which was near Dhangi Gate , 2 kms far from difficulty .
From there we went to roam around Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening .
I had set out from Delhi that if I see the lions roaming around in the jungle then I would see lions in dreams all night .
Suddenly I heard a tremendous roar in the midst of the depths of the night , and the dogs who began to bark after that did not stop for two hours .
Therefore the suggestion of visiting Kaladhungi and Corbett Falls came first .
Kaladhungi is 30 kms away while Carbet Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladhungi where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
It was twelve o'clock in the morning while returning .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this hut .
On reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had arranged for singing in the number one site Bijarani there .
On asking about number one told that there is more Grasland and Tigers come towards it to prevent cold during this time .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half rupees for four hours to roam .
We left for the jungle .
We saw several types of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
In the meanwhile the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad to see that the tiger was not visible .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
I had a tiger ride in my mind .
Then I remembered one of Haldwani ' s old friends .
I called him the same way .
I told him I had come to Carbet .
He asked , Whether Tiger saw it or not .
His words pierced like arrows .
I said softly , No .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take a safari inside .
