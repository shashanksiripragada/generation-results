Black box in your car
While the US road planners are struggling with the lack of funds to improve the collapsed highway system, many people are looking at the solution in the small black box, which fits with the cleaning on your car's dashboard. .
This device, which tracks every milestone carried by the motor driver and communicates that information to the authorities, has now become a controversial issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to renovate the old system for financing major US roads.
Generally, boring work like highway planning has also become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
You have joined the Liberatorian Environmental Groups in favour of allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep the details of the mile driven by you, and possibly the driven location - and to use this information to prepare the tax bill.
The tea party is a beggar.
The US Civil Liberation Union is also very worried about raising various types of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are searching for how they can go to such a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for each mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken a black box for the test drive, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is actually a compulsory thing for our country.
"It is not a matter of whether or not to be elected by us, it is to say that Hassan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, who is planning to start tracking every mile set by motor-drivers in California by 2025. Is planning. "
The way we pay tax is going to change.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the highway trust fund of the country has almost become bankrupt, which is financed by the payment of taxes on the gas pump by American citizens.
American people do not buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more than ever before in a gallon gas.
There has been no increase in Federal Tax in the last 20 years, which is 18. 4 cent per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians refrain from increasing a single penny in tax.
Lee Munich, a transport policy expert at Minnesota University, says, "Gas is not absolutely comprehensive."
His state has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most logical option."
Wonx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good to the urban liberals, as this, for example, can change taxes to change the mode of driving, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
California planners are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to fulfill the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Shuster (A-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favor of paying per mile by the driver.
In the region, the vice-president of the policy, Adrian Moore said, "This is not just a tax which is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 had graceed to move forward in the direction of per-mile payment from the Congress.
The US Senate had sanctioned a 90 million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing such persons who had to walk a lot of miles to go to work daily or to go to the city, the leadership of the House ended that proposal there. .
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most interested Oragon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, including 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support everywhere.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, the driver was very impatient thinking that the government could monitor each of his steps.
Alauddin Khan, who guides strategic and performance management in the Nevada Transport Department, says, "Concern about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem.
This is not something people wanted.
With the advancement of the test, Nevada's ACLU had warned on its website: "Transforming these devices into a full tracking device will be quite easy.
There is no need to develop a large, unmanageable technology infrastructure, which must be spread to keep a daily record of every individual.
Nevada is one of the many states which is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles a car is running, but not where and when it is running.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Miles.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
However, the device which is testing is good for the highway planners as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
Ryan Morison, chief executive of True Miles, said, "If you do not track the speed and location of the people, they will be more interested in adopting this method."
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are also very low cost and less interference methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners are using different options to drivers.
They can select a GPS device or a GPS device.
Or you can not choose to take any device again, but you can choose to pay the prescribed fee on the basis of the average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places are hopeful that this concept can be sold to the concerned citizens by providing more convenience than less in the device.
In New York City, Transport Officers are trying to develop a taxing device that will facilitate payment of parking meter fees, "payment insurance according to their drive, and actual time speed data from other drivers. Will be used to avoid motor-driver traffic. "
It has been mentioned in the city planning document that "motor-drivers will be attracted to participation due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the entire discussion on payment according to miles is a big distraction.
In the San Francisco Gulf region, the Metropolitan Transport Commission has said that Congress can easily deal with the problem of bankrupt highway trust fund by increasing gas tax.
The drivers of hybrids or other cars can also be charged with additional one-time or annual fees, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their dues.
Randy Rentcheller, director of the Commission's legislation and public affairs, said, "When Aspirin can work, what is the need for a radical surgery"
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death has happened due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the departed goods with him.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Dariya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the inquiry that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of late ahid.
Ruhal went to bath in Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the luggage on the shore, while Ruhal went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhal searched for ahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other accessories and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that ahid was drowned.
Police told the court that ahid died due to drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Ruhal has been taken into custody under Section 404 to hide the facts and the goods of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister 77-year-old Sylvio Berlusconi, who is known for Bunga-Bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very intelligence manner.
This is disclosed by his family friend Marthal Polonko.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Franciska Pascal in her personal chapel.
Franciska's meeting with Balusconi took place when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia Party.
It is Franciska right there, whose relationship was being said that his relationship with Balrusconi is just a pretext.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga Girl Marthal Polonko have revealed that he was also invited to this intelligence marriage.
This ceremony has happened three weeks ago.
In the disclosure on Italian Radio2, when Polonco was asked what would happen if both of them got married, Polonco has said that both of them are already married.
This was not a public function.
This marriage took place in a private chapel located in the former Prime Minister's house.
Apart from this, no one can tell anything.
Although she did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjoda.
Both of them married about three weeks ago i.e. 8 or 9 October.
About 8 months ago, a 50-year-old 28-year-old woman from her was engaged to Franciska Pascal.
To avoid the misery, Berlusconi had formed the basis of loneliness behind this decision.
In the lower areas, the rain continued to intermittently between Suraj's eye and Michauli.
Along with this, cold wave has started in the whole plaintiff.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail for sexual harassment, once again got disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a drinker of children's blood, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news about Asaram and said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of showing news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter and said that they have more options.
Even before this, the court has rejected Asaram's demand for a ban on media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the case of the biggest TDS theft so far.
The group operator of the mall cut the TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it in the public exchequer.
By doing so, the TDS rupee was deposited with itself.
On October 17, the exploration team from Mumbai took action with the Jaipur Exploration Team.
In the investigation of this episode, it was found that the trader has cut the TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started the action of Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of sealing the account was about 15 days ago, raids and surveys were carried out on this mall operator's group.
Angered by this action, the trader has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay the TDS rupee to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously taking action by targeting them.
In this case, the investigating officers have clarified that in case of non-payment, recovery will be taken by sealing the account.
Considering Deepawali, the demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of poor and fake cattle increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mavas and chemical sweets.
The department seized a spoon of 70 thousand rupees from Madhya Pradesh and 5 thousand from uetta Colony.
With the demand for sweets increased in the market, demand for poor mawa has also increased from Madhya Pradesh.
The department got information about bringing the poor Mave kept in the dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Mave's consignment is being floated from transport garage to Nagpur.
The department took possession of this mawa, which was valued at 70 thousand rupees.
Fear of action did not express any right to measure.
The department destroyed it as an unclaimed property.
The department raided the Jitendra Caterers located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand glasses.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulphate was used to shine and stay for more days.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
Department's Deputy Commissioner SS Deshmukh said that the campaign for chemical sweets and poor and fake cattle will continue.
In the next few days, the information about speeding up the campaign has been given by the department.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause toxicity.
The department asked sweet businessmen to make sweets from good milk, cattle.
An appeal has been made to the people on behalf of the Department to be cautious of fake sweets and maves.
The elected 42 senior leaders of the state BJP received their vigorous reception at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come to Bihar for a consolation visit organized by the BJP.
The consolation journey is organized by the BJP on behalf of the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is notable that during the hunker rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were a total of seven blasts after one.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally, so that more and more people were casualties and there was panic in the state.
The motive of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Party leaders from their village have come out on a trip from Thursday.
On November 5, all those bones will be flown simultaneously in the Ganges in Patna.
Consolation journey is organized as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the villages of those killed in the blasts from seven o'clock in the morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, they will also provide a check of five to five rupees to the relatives of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
Encouraged by the bogus victory in the last match, when the Indian team will land in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will be to capture the series with victory.
Due to the rains, India had to win Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series after the two ODIs were washed away and its batsmen showed a bursting show and won the record, so that the team matched 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest goal is also proving to be dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, in the form of Rohit and Summit, the team has got such a salute pair which is easing the work of the rest of the batsmen with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he gave Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while making a spectacular partnership in opening.
Kohli, who has performed so far at number three, is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket pundits have given them better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 next week, has set up 17 ODI centuries, out of which India has won 16.
Following the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in a strong form, but the excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were floping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open accounts in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as a 'lifeline'.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have influenced everyone with his performance.
They are also demanding that they be taken in the Test team for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen to the ninth number.
In addition to Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Wogs and James Fockner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aron Finch have not been able to leave any effect in opening.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling can be heavy for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed so far in the series, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashes series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this shameful peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate terrorists near 2000 prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
After the failure of the separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has become even worse.
Referring to the Pakistani visit of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lieutenant General ahir-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's donor Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be aired in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
Suicide attacks in the killing of soldiers on the border, Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for abolishing the army's privileges in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that such things are also anti-people till there is lasting peace in the state.
They get anti-national elements.
He emphasized that the statements of the leaders, the morale of the security forces should be banned.
Prepare Snow Dan to collaborate with Germany on American vigilance
Edward Snow Den, the US intelligence informer, has declared that German is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to Parliament if US National Security Agency and its director Kith Alexander fails to respond to their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Straw Bayley met Mr. Snow Den Segurwar in Russia, where he has been given asylum to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter submitted by Mr. Snow Den to the media in Berlin on Friday: "Although the outcome of my efforts is positively positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party change, and provides no defense, which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with felony charges. "
However, speaking the truth hasn't been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include theft of intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, Minister of German Internal Affairs, told Leit online: Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the US and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has bugged the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence.
Mr. Straw Belle, a Green Party MP from Germany, published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their journey to Russia.
Mr. Straw Belen said, according to a former NSA contractor lawyer, if he leaves Russia, Snow Den is not able to return to Russia.
If Snow Den testified in Germany, he would be safe there... the assurances needed, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Den said, "He had to face a terrible and sustainable campaign, so he had to leave the house.
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by widespread responses to its work of political expression.
The world citizens, including the United States, as well as higher officials, have underestimated the revelation of a irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a resolution to collaborate with the German authorities when problems of human conditions have been resolved .
Crontier Airlines will charge Carry - On Baggage
Crontier Airlines plans to charge  100 to carry luggage to passengers on board to the carriage-on store.
Frontier Airlines plans to start a charge for "100" for a carry-on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday it announced that the passengers can keep the entire box.
The new carrier - on charge is for the bag in overhead bin, so, the small bag below the seat will still be charged free.
Crontier said that 25 will charge if payment is made in advance, "100 will have to wait if the passengers wait for payment until they are at the gate.
Crontier spokesman Kate O'Mally said that  100 fees are to be obtained to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said."
Airlines started charging for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are filling as much as they can , in the carriage on baggage which is stashed in the overhead box , means that this box often has less space .
There's a way to bring less for travelers on the duty board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It's for the most loyal customers about Crontier that overhead bin's been fast finding harder.
Passengers who buy tickets in their airline website do not have to pay this.
This means that in line the next person may have to pay  100 for the same bag, while a passenger, a bag free in line at a frontier gate.
O'Malley said that the procedures of Crontier's website and check-in are being changed to ensure that the passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Crontier's new carrier-on fees won't start until summer even though a date hasn't been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage fees and other charges, but the airlines like them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
Many are watching the baggage fees on Wall Street as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them haven't even touched the carry-on-bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the carriage on fee for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee, the other airline is Hungary's Fi Air, which airline adviser J. Sorensen said, and who tracks the aid-on-fees.
He said that Spirit's carry-on fee brings 50 million in a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines official recently flew to Spirit and wondered if the passengers had to face carriage-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was simple," he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he offered it a lickety-split."
Crontier is also following 2 fees of coffee, tea, soda, or Spirit for juice.
Crontier said that the passengers who take soda, or juice, can keep the whole box, and this free coffee will be given only once.
It'll still let the water go.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after seven months after the complaint of the passengers, they retreated and followed any other main airline after being there.
If the passengers of Crontier's do not buy directly from the airline, then this step of Crontier to charge charges on Carri-on is his latest attempt to operate customers towards his own website.
Airlines pays to the online travel vendor for such 10 to 25 each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
Crontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September many often started flying miles from half to the customers who bought from an online travel agency from these persons
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip miles.
So, a 1000-mile rantier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It also allows the only passengers to choose their seats in advance if they buy directly from the Crontier website.
Customers have a loyal base in their hometown in Denver, Crontier, but its business is decreasing and it's losing money.
The decline in revenues by 9 percent and its flight capacity has decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
As part of the sales of the Republic Airlines, they're trying to determine the finance of Crontier.
NSA blames "internal error" rather than hackers for website crashing
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical shortcomings, our website was closed for a few hours, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
The intelligence agency said in an email statement, "Today night NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours, which was due to an internal error during the pre-determined update.
This problem will be solved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS].
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not accessible.
A NSA spokesman told ABC News that "there was no agreement" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hectavist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website by the DDOS attack.
DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity until the site is closed due to overloading of the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively incorporated and the aim of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the target system.
The ex-highly mysterious NSA, once known as "no such agency", has become a subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people by the overwhelming presence of events of foreign and domestic espionage programmes in the past months, which followed the stolen and revelation of NSA files secreted by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who were collectively displaced.
Due to such a growing controversy over the agency, there was speculation after the incident tonight that the incident was the result of the targeted cyber operation.
Beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the story of 'One and Dronacharya' showing harmony in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path by mortgaging in the fleet.
The play started in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College, Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice President of Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh jointly.
In the drama, Dronacharya of Dwapar era and presently the equilibrium of the circumstances of a professor Arvind was shown.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod restless, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a spectacular presentation while doing full justice with the characters.
In the drama, the lighting system was designed by young color worker Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were given to the Vibhutis who contributed literary, culturally to Upta on behalf of Upta.
In this, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and colorful Jitendra C. Raj were given.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. were contributing to the success of the event.
Decrease in Bombardier's profits as a delivery of aircraft, decline in orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profits on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and less on contract issues as aircraft orders and pressure by delivery.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not present an update on issues that would be completed by releasing any flight test data for its brand new CSRIs aircraft or its ambitious program to enter the commercial service from September next.
Almost half a month before the first flight of the test aircraft, it's just been blown up three times, the question is whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below the forecast and the shares were sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for sliding more than 8 percent.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst share with the National Bank Financial, reduced its rating for "regional performance" on Thursday, the stock is limited to the top between the next one or two quarters.
"The hard aircraft delivery was mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market program will be embarrassed.

New research has shown that we work with full sincerity and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal one side against the rule.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Eclass School of Business in UTA.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values without having a stress of work in the morning, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or excessive pressure in the evening.
Researchers made two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is higher on the left or on the right side.
The participants were told that if they give wrong answers instead of the correct answer, they will be given money.
It was observed in this experiment that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, while experimenting on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in mind.
With this, the researchers managed to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening, we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Cocaine ' s habitual lawyer imprisoned for giving secret information about police investigation to Mr . Big
42 - year - old Basharat Ditta used to inform infamous criminal Neil Scarborough
The advocate felt that his confidential drug addiction might be known to the people .
He was sentenced to three years in jail by Liverpool Crown Court
The defendant's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid that people would know about his secret addiction to drugs, three years of imprisonment.
42-year-old Barasat Ditta, after compromising with his cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information to the infamous criminal Neil Scarborough about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities.
This advocate, who was given the surname of "Bash", and who was praised by the criminals as "Top Brief", was arrested from his house in 2011 after conducting police surveillance in Scarborough, which he had previous Narcotics Trial represented.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarborough keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out with his colleagues for the law society dinner.
After getting the cocaine particles in DITTA's hair, its wallets, and its credit cards, the investigation revealed that DITTA was a "regular user of A category drugs.
During the period of eight months between January to August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation of heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Mercedes, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons, who were sent to jail after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and cash of more than 200,000 pounds during several impressions.
42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because she feared that people did not know about her cocaine addiction.
DITTA, working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburnard, was facing abusiveness in the Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the path of justice after three weeks of trial in Liverpool Crown Court.
He had accepted the cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started at the time when investigating Scarborough, the police came to know that he was in regular contact with Ditta on the phone from February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping drugs with more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After the drug was kept, Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta, who went out to dinner at the Blackern Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that when the clues of A category drug were found on Ditta's hair, wallets and credit cards, he was found to be a "regular user of cocaine" in the test.
Ditta was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and said that his discussion was "the subject of legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta took out his wallet and tried to remove many credit cards, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run office from his house along with his workplace, and his client used to call him at his house for legal matters.
After telling the arrested persons what the detectives knew about them, the court hearing said that Ditta used to call the prominent people of the drug supply chain, some of which he had presented the case earlier. .
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said: "The criminal advocate should know the best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal advocate, too much attachment to his specific client.
We are not talking about the general drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his talks must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his own limits of lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted the investigation of the police as much as possible so that he could be able to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not honoring his profession but humiliating.
He made a lot of proximity to certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed the agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that "If I was a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately. "
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Helstead said that at the time Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself into a criminal advocate from a criminal advocate.
Due to the addiction of his cocaine, he compromised a lot and became very weak towards the objectives of leading members of the organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information regarding police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and people should have confidence and confidence.
Shri Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to avoid his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now disrupting the path of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to court.
This matter should work as a warning to the criminals that no person is far from the reach of law.
We will find you and present it to the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for the death penalty client in America, his dinner guest of Mohammad Ali and inequality to be inspired for his work.

After the 1992 Peace Agreement, it became an opposition party.

With the attack on former rebels and then increasing, the government forces attacked the Renmo bases and told the Financial Times to try to kill Afso Dhaka Ma, group leader, Fernando Majang, Ray Namo spokesman.

Mr . Mazang was quoted as saying that the 1992 Peace Agreement had been repealed by Ray Namo , but has become a matter of concern again .
He told the UTT that means he ' s not being honored by the agreement free limo
Our vision is to come back to the negotiations, but seriously, Mr. Majhong said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to reduce the stress of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men fighting together (Jibuzhan and Dhakama), a lecturer at Yusuf Han London Open University and a Mozambique expert said.
Neither of them are good negotiators nor are they prepared to make types of concessions necessary.
Ray Namo has been insisting on electoral reforms , which had already said about the boycott of municipal elections in November .
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an attempt to win concessions from the government and a sick movement to win economic robbery.

Children should be taught Mithaks and legends as models for a way of "life writer".
Thor ' s stories could show that the power of cruelty has no match for subtle tricks , while economic legends show the significance of a dream .
In order to teach many of the myths, it would not be appropriate to "interesting far away" and in some cases it would not be appropriate to teach pornography and schools, Cross Lee Holland advocated a "care selection" from one of the suitable works of the age.
"I find it surprising, in the United States, myths and folk songs are already a part of education, they said.
I'm advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers more enlightening  and this is a new twist for children , simultaneously messages are being presented in entertaining stories .
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beovulf from Anglo Saxon, along with a Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, wrote: "Your intentions may be a lot but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Perhaps a child requires an adult writer and an adult writer writing a great difference between an adult .

And that should be submitted, but rather revealed through a story compared to it.
Not showing the old base.

People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of Standup Comedy in America: About a hundred years ago, humorous dramatist Frank Fay, who used to work as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theater in Broadway, started joking directly to the crowd in the manner of conversation.
The discovery of FE has expanded over the years, most recently in the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and operated by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Standup Institute, Carolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.

We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Vanda Sykes, Cathy Griffin and Bill Maihar, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retired persons in Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes in which Bruce Springstein, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and other artists including Bill Cosby joined.

Many of the participants of this year's festival have come from non-traditional channels such as small networks like Comedy Central, F. and Spike.
Nick Kroll, the Deep-Cable Citcom (F. ) joyfully reached the main place with the "The League with the Ranchi Fantasy-Football theme", and now he has his own comedy Central Sketch Show.
Jenny Slate has been the "Satellite Night Live" and "Cost Member of Parcels and Recreation", although she is well-known for her viral video series "Marshal the Shell with Shoes".
Other young Comedians with different voices, including crawls and slates, (Anthony Jesselenic with different disappointing voices, satirical, ethnic-centered W. Kamau Bell) are products of the American comedy decentralized world.
One of the most important attractions of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg's talk to Larry David:
Steinberg started working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
This meeting will be held in the center of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
Steinberg said, "The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of all Larry's work.
They were telling me that when he is here, sometimes he goes to the street between two buildings and used to think in himself that ifever I lose my whole money then I will be here.

The court has barred action on the New York Police Department ' s break and sports policy .
On Thursday, a federal appeals court required a judge's order for the break-up and sports program of the New York Police Department blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court Appellate 2 End Judge Shira Shindeller has said that the judge's decision will be pending as a result of an appeal by the city.
In the Judge Nagar, it was ruled in August in violation of the constitution in the manner in which it prevented people and out of its program of inquiry.
The City Police Department has also decided to allocate a surveillance to help in its policy and its related training programme change, its findings and its curative orders have been appealed.
The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday on the request migration.
The Appellate Court has said that because he compromised the need for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a series of media interviews and wrongdoings for the US judges by the public, therefore the judge should be removed from the case, publicly accountable to criticize the court of statements.
The judge had ruled that the police officers incorrectly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and hyssanic men with its break and sports program.
He has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and he is the most closed where some premises have ordered a pilot program to test the body's clothing cameras.

An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
Cease and sports device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The cease-fire and sports policy has been in some way around the decades, but most of the black and hyssanic men, from 684330 to 2011, the independent mayor Michael has dramatically stopped the growth under the administration of Bloomberg to raise all the time.
A case was filed by four men in 2004 by all minorities and a class action case.
A supporter of the change in the NPP's break and sports program has said that the unfair behavior will end, another more reliable and effective police force will have to be molded and can affect the use of other police department's policy.
Opponents say the change will reduce the morale of the police, but crime, money wasted and not during the last decade, thousands of officers will solve a comprehensive problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking.
The judge has noted that the termination and sports had not been terminated, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NPO stop.
In the training, participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts joined a large number.

The Bench heard on Thursday that Callson talked to Mr. Blinket about love relations with a married woman, while at that time he was looking at the case of co-defendant Rebekha Brooks, who was married at that time.
Callson and Brooks refused to interfere with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 2001 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlback and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.

On the instructions of the office (B) to protect the Constitution, the mission of Germany's domestic intelligence agency was to take a picture of the roof of the US post, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
The German media asked the FB to express hope to identify the presence of Listening Antenna and indicated a exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper , director of American national intelligence , insisted that the United States should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal  foreign companies ' business secrets and enhance their international competitiveness or enhance the line below them in September .
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, started telling the American surveillance of the treasures of his secrets, the leaders of the European governments and business world are no longer sure that the director does not follow his promise.
The U . S . National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras , and our cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , expressed fears about state monitoring .
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also making possible goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit .
"Germany should wake up" says Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost become a big risk like China, when it comes to stealing industrial espionage and data.
In all the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is no evidence so far that the United States knows the business mysteries of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the EU and should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
The business leaders are doubting this about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
Hasso Planner, chairman of the German business software company SAP, said, "This is not a way."
If a strong European IT industry wanted, then it would not have to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional, from coal to car, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden ' s disclosures on American technical refinement and espionage access have proven to be a trauma for some companies which earlier believed that China is the biggest surveillance threat .
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing area where European officials are more conscious that the data stored in the United States is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become possible sensitive .
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business institution, some 10 percent non-US members canceled the plan to use an American-based cloud provider after the disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabay, Co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP says: "We saw a new question which customers did not come a year ago - is where is my data stored And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that the powerful state wants to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore they should be guarded at all costs.
It is not a surprising thing that economic espionage happens.
It has always happened.
"This has been a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed, Current Bock, Chemical Manufacturer says the Chief Executive of BASE."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we , too , because it is in the national interest to defend our business .
Corporate leaders are usually not interested in the defense system and it is an advantage for the attacker.
For big companies, the message record has been going on for a long time, whether it is absurd to leave one in the house-to-house business with a usb stick, or to leave a laptop unconscious in a hotel room, at least to say.
Members of the Board of Car Manufacturers Audi, Clear Lackenberg, say that this is a one-year-old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings as they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's B executive, while smart phones are compromising on foreign tours, advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are the top in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secrets against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access.
The US has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the France the Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February named after Russia and Israel in the second tire of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence behind China.
According to a board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when it comes to financial espionage, French is the worst
In the interview, the former head of the Bernard Suarcini French Internal Intelligence Agency URI, explains: "Services know well that even if all the countries cooperate in non-terrorist battles, spy on their colleagues."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we , too , because it is in the national interest to defend our business .
No fools made.
"The parents of Georgia's teenager killed in an accident believe that his son was murdered"
A teenager from Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in a restaurant mat in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, the family's advocate said this on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA was found trapped in a straight mat behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators of Landes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson was dead in a "unfortunate accident", but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Nump, who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "he completely believes that his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in death in the manner told by Sheriff.
The number said that "he believes that this is beyond the logic of physical rule and general intelligence."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
He said that "he had sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag"
US Advocate General Michael Mulre said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death
Did he be murdered due to any crime
Murray said this at a press conference in the afternoon on Thursday.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring the truth out.
He said that "I think there is environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
Moore told the reporter that initial corpse tests indicate that Johnson's death resulted in static respiratory disease.
According to Moore, in a second body test, there was a different reason for death.
He said that "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to summon a criminal or to examine civil rights in case of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the Landage County Sheriff's office.
On Wednesday, the Southern Georgian judge ordered the authorities to issue all the monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that the video footage will indicate how he died.
CDC issues Childrens Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines to control the food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the US Government as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergies.
Now one in every 20 children in the US has food allergies.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, cases of food allergies in children have increased by 18 percent.
The guidelines indicate how teachers and staff should be informed about the food allergies of children, and how to handle them in case of any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep a stock of Epinephrine to face potentially fatal acute anaphylaxis - which is the auto-engineer of the Epine Brand, which is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can easily keep the stock of epinephrine in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms communicated by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It seems that something is pricking in my tongue, "It seems that there is hair on my tongue, or "It is sneezing in my tongue."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children's sex undetermined
Germany has become the first country in the European Union, which has recognized the third gender for children born with vague genitals.
Now newborn children will not be specified male or female in a conventional manner.
According to the new law, parents do not have to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender "undefined" or "undefined" on the birth certificate of the child.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can hasten the decisions related to gender-specific surgery for newborn children, and to fight discrimination against Intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will continue to be a wounded, stained penalties made by doctors.
According to estimates, one of the 2,000 children every year is such that there is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexes, part of a group of about 60 conditions that comes under the scrutiny of gender development disorders, it is a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals ( ovary or testis), or abnormally developed gender.
Valis sympson may be intersex.
Gender identification is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender determination can not be done, it is better to use the best information available to specify gender and to conduct surgery, If such a situation comes, inspect the psychological and physical development of the child.
Dr. Jack Dresser, psychologist of New York City, who is a specialist in gender identification, said that the new law of Germany seems to be "good".
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state of life-crisis, which requires surgery, but this does not happen with most children."
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex develops in a child, it is not very accurate.
No person can give a proper answer about why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, Intersex people have been described differently from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to sex but related to its biological composition, which is neither explicitly male nor female, but either jointly or neither of them are clearly defined.
These features can display themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as weight of muscles, distribution of hair, breast and length primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital or chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by Inter-Sex and Transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as of harassment, violence and partisan crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-corresponding gender.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark male, female or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norry M-Welby became the world's first recognized sexless person after winning a legal appeal to keep "unspecified gender status" for life.
According to the Internal Ministry, in addition to M or F in the German passport, there will also be third specification in the form of  for intersex persons.
According to a news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this stringent Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw gender principles from school books.
US website Catholic Online has also opposed Germany's law saying, "When the world is going to such a state where gender is the option to be chosen, but not sexual activity, we are of civilization Two more pillars are taking in the opposite direction. "
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn baby also told the baby zone that she would like to see the children being specified at birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, "The upbringing is very stressful without extra boundaries, especially if you do not know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called Hermaphrodites (Ubhilingi), in the name of the beautiful Greek god, who was bilingi.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender as a slate and could be rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgeons, they understand that gender identification is a complex task, and sometimes there can be a mistake from doctors, who do not know that when children grow up, what will they feel about their gender specification
Dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Psychological Emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist, you used to call a surgeon.
The present theory about the treatment of children with vague reproductive organs was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hapkins University, who considered sex to be constructive.
He composed the word gender identification and argued how social and environmental signs - parents raise the child - interaction with the gene and hormones of the child to identify him as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as "Jonjoon", their principles became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose gender was accidentally sexed during circumaculation, to remove the testicles of the child and take her up as a girl.
The dresser said, "Mani presented that case as a successful case of transition, but it did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following the pattern.
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after the year 1990, people passing through these gender surgeries started coming out, "Not happy with the consequences."
The same case was with 36-year-old Montana writer Jim Bruce, who was born with the Y male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
The doctors did not clearly understand that his penis was small, or his genitalia was large, but he was certain that he could never live a "comfortable life" as a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external organ and testicles of the bruce were removed by surgery and it was raised like a girl.
She was given women hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl.
I was not happy, but questioning was very difficult.
At the age of 18, Vaginoplasty was about to be accompanied by him.
But feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the horrific truth.
I was sterilized at the time of birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented her body from making enough testosterone, due to which her genitals could not be properly developed.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, he took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
Due to surgery, he became inferior.
Today, he explains to people about Interface Project to normalize their perception about Interface Persons.
However, Annie Tamar-Matis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites chippy and stigma".
She says, "Many active people feel that Germany's law will motivate parents to make quick decisions and specify the child "undetermined".
We are afraid that this will encourage interference.
We feel that instead of waiting, it is a better process to specify male or female sex.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Matis said that his organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender."
He said, "Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender.
Germany's law is related to specifying it at birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburg's breast radiologist Dr. Erlean Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany's law will provide "power" to both parents and children.
Baratzi's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called full endrogen insensitivity symptom.
Since there was a defect in his endrogen collection, women's characteristics developed in Katie.
There is vagina in her body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although he is inferior, he expects to adopt or become a mother through a guest surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents not to make any decision in haste."
It gives them understanding and time properly by testing some tests before writing men or women.
In this way, you're fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy it.
We do not have to undergo such a surgery in haste which can not be returned.
He said, "It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the misery that motivates them because they do not believe that they are doing well."
Ultimately, the child will determine which sex is more comfortable - and this will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Report: Consider Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times , President Barack Obama ' s closest advisers secretly considered Hillary Clinton as vice - president for the 2012 ticket .
The most remarkable explosion in the revelation is that Mark Halperine and John Halemon's hugely anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, "Wood Down: Change the Games 2012.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and told Thursday evening that the President's top advisers, "Broad group sessions" and in order to know the polling in 2011, what dumping Biden can help in Obama's hope of re-election. .
The book , according to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin , describes the full details of the actions of the chief executives , and the White House casts the main bills of the former White House staff for the name , to find out what effect the former state secretary Clinton ' s change from the vice president on the poll .
Potential switch was a very safe secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office .
Only half a dozen close advisers of the President, including the former Obama campaign chief Jim Macina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlerod and David Paulouf - were under consideration.
Down claims that Dale attempts to change Biden . Despite his personal synergy , ultimately , before the decision was taken , when his information suggested that Clinton ' s ticket would not improve Obama ' s situation .
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I kept the whole scene in mind, and one of them, it was Dale told the newspaper."
You remember, that the presidency was in danger at that time, so we were in such a situation, "Pavitra Christ, what else will we do"
While Dale told the research as a precaution, Martin had told ENDCO's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again invested significantly in finding out how much dividend this claim would give to the poll.
 The campaign does not spend on voting and focused groups like money unless they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
It is ambiguous, although, did Obama know that his team is looking for change
Martin told CNN that he asked him if his boss knew about possible reshuffle
Delle said he didn ' t think the president knew about the possible change , the former Chief of Staff acknowledged that It is possible that Obama knew it .
"Will Down definitely do not answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk" Martin said more.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama did not know about Biden dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps, Martin said.
Glo-in-the-Dark ice cream likes
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first Glo-in-the-Dark ice cream - using geliphish.
Charlie Francis has taken great advantage of marine animals to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came to him after reading a research paper on Jailfish and Chinese convincing scientists used the chemical glow to shine the protein again.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of protein by responding to the eater's tongue and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says the ice cream shines with a reaction from the heat of the mouth , i . e . the more it shines , the more it shines .
Charlie, founder of Like MIM Dalicius Icecream Company, said, "This is an incredible thing but the initial days of production will get me 200 to 0 grams of luggage."
The protein we're using in ice cream will react to the neutral pH on the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the PH level and the ice cream will shine.
We ' re examining for the past few months and seemingly right to share it on the heloven because it gives amazing shining effects
It ' s probably the most expensive ice cream that makes menace because the glimpse of jailfish is four times more expensive than gold .
So the cost of each scoope comes to me around 140 pounds .
Although the Viska taste is very good.
Charlie's experimental company, beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves based in Bristol are famous for abnormal taste.
But his next composition is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is naturally impossible because of the ice crystal which makes refraction over the ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of the reflective quality of a gelfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market was stuck with the customers in the Rani Bagh market.
It was a matter of fact that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
The same thing happened in the Central Market located in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Prashant Vihar.
Something similar was seen at Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Sarafa shops of Model Town.
Even here, people fiercely bought gold and silver jewelery and coins.
For this reason, there was also a jam in other markets including the outer ring road.
However, people from the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Heloven 2013: By Numbers

I hope for a lot of zombis, and thankful to the dead, our Instagram feeds for space men this year.
According to Google, the most searched dresses will be ombis, buttons, robbers and witches.
I guess there is no harm in being traditional.
Last year we dressed dogs and we were not alone with surprising.
According to the NCR, Americans will really spend 330 million for pet dresses.
It's ironic that a lot of hotdogs are with dogs.
When it comes to Candy, we do not see around.
According to the Nilsen company, Americans will spend 1.9 billion this year.
Heyrishi Bars, Lollipop, Milk Duds, Twizlers and Clark Bar are around 600 million pounds.

Finally, let's talk about pumpkin.
Charlie Brown presented the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a Jack-o-Lalten carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something we have done since we were small.
Fortunately for us, "Baby in a pumpkin trend" started last year, thanks to the pinterest, so most of us carved these guards out and did not stay with them.
According to the US Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend around  106 million on pumpkins.
Perhaps the lantern that drives jack-o gradually on its front portion may be Illinois , which increased by 542 million pounds this year .
If you are looking for extra loans, try to dig up their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin above the phone tim and susan matists in NAPA, Kalif.

A firefighting team was called to save a lost puppy on the face of a crispy mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine

He was observed by a dog walker stranded in the mine three days later .
Firefighters brought down the front portion of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from death
After Puppy got trapped in the face of a difficult mountain 50 feet above the ground in some way, he got a lucky life by calling firefighters.

George Kerraven : Euro disintegration gave Scotts options
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland would be required to join the entire Europe as an independent travel area as a condition of membership of the EU.
Passport control on Barwick and indicate stories about the boundary of barbed wire on the walls of the headrian.
It is true that Strathclide Paper describes the potential economic gains of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it was not forecast in Headlines.
Nor did anybody describe that the EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a Shangen Region, Brussels will actually be cheaper for non-compliance Brussels in return for achieving whatever he wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has been frozen. First of all, "Independence means passport control baseless news was heard about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in repeating this interesting old story.
Anyway, why should we expect Europe's bidding from independent Scotland
Why London's Yok should be purchased for Brussels, especially now
There is real European news: The great, post-war plan to organise Europe has eventually stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe is officially dead.
In the entire EU, dedicated parties are getting stronger to oppose the EU or to shut down the Euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscapetal Alternative for Germany - which has been established this year - suddenly came and obtained nearly five million votes in the federal elections of September, and thus free democrats (equivalent to our own lib dams) were effectively excluded from Bundestag.
The plan to build federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be radical changer.
With the stringent rules imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project has gone far away from Europe due to hurdles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
The Euro crisis did not have a very large role in the high budget deficit of national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized its members the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in the underlying loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce wages and public expenditure - encouraged by Berlin.
Deeper European productivity is sick than the current budget and currency problems.
In order to exempt French and German energy firms on consumer expenditure - as a result of the "green energy policies" imposed by Brussels, the European industry doubles electricity for the United Nations and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even freezing all wages in the world can not save the European petrochemicals industry from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of revolt is spreading among the people, especially in France, who was once the chief admirer of the EU.
After the war, the top French politicians saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany, and providing Paris a billing equal to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the French economy is staggering.
Results: The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-EU National Front, has won the victory by pushing the ruling socialist in third place in the recent by-election.
At present, the Front in France is the most popular party with 24 per cent of the vote - it is a constant warning to the British Labour that they cannot assume that the disintegration for the left will automatically benefit the right.
Lee Pen is doing with his new fame in the French whites, working classes
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to form an anti-EU, anti-currency faction in the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My vision is: soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-cancer sentiments in Europe will eliminate the Euro.
The euro will not be completely finished, but this retail  (sovereign) nations will return to some form like Europe, which will be supported by General De Gaulle.
Germany and some of its steady economies can maintain the Euro, but France and Southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I hope that the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of enhancing its close proximity to the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (essentially).
Or we can protect our own economic interests, including the separation of Berlin and Brussels at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-UN nations to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic independence while following the path of Norway.
The SNP Government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful anti-financial campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dam alliance proposed by Labour Chancellor Elistair Darling.
It will be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of economics imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Puberty before time: Being bigger
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get puberty at an early age compared to white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near .
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of puberty at an early age
Premature puberty case is not as effective in boys .
Former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheries is an expert journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts and genital hair in the age of 7 or 8 years
This week, at the annual conference of the American Paediatrics Academy in Orlando, Florida, Dr Paul Caplovitz, a pediatric endocrineologist, clarified that these early physical changes are common in American girls, they show new trends.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time in reassuring parents - that generally it does not show rapid progress towards full youth."
Direct symptoms of development such as sprouting of breasts, genitals and gum hair and physical smells are seen in girls prematurely.
But in the last four decades, there has been a slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first monthly-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
When the breasts start to grow then it takes at least two to three years in the first tests , which tells caplovitz , which is also the author of premature puberty in girls : the guide to deal with this common problem .
The most accurate test time for the development of youth is time.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, it is called "breast-mature".
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - whose pediatrician can closely inspect.
In case of faster progress, an endocrinologist may need to examine the possibility of serious problems like tumors or cysts.
There are remedies to delay premature menstrual cycle and other consequences: premature aging of bones, which may lead to undeveloped growth and dramatic stature as adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthoodity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is conscious about medicines but acknowledges, "Suppressing youth can increase practical issues, and girls can start feeling different from their colleagues."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their young daughter to have menstruation.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and was upset that in his friends, he first started menstruation.
There are many popular principles about the causes of untimely youth.
Nevertheless, there is no continuous evidence that hormones in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment or sexually oriented messages in the media can be accused.
Boys too - like girls - are getting premature youth.
Caplovites determine the rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting studies on girls aged 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects body fat with puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get puberty before their age-old white girls.
There are many explanations of this.
At the global level, the pattern of premature puberty seems to be affected by all things ranging from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting hair of face and genitals at an early age, but the trend of puberty is not as clear as girls in them.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even infants and children, it has become common to see the hair of pimples and genitals.
Dr. Laurens Silverman, a pediatrician, Andocrinologist, at the Garybe Children's Hospital in Moristoun, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about how we recognize the actual beginning of youth."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "This may mean negotiating before the expected time."
If you remain calm then your child will normally answer properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even though it is happening before time, it is a part of normal life.
On Thursday, the temperature was recorded at 3.1 degree Celsius.

Big orders of jet manufacturers at stake with a dispute for seat width .
There has been a competition for this month's Dubai arsho, setting rhythm for the quarrel, among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights
The controversy is focused on the width of the Economy class seat in long flights, not always given by Erlines, but whose allotted space efficiency is claimed to be the key by Letest Jet Arbus SAS and Boeing Company..
Erbus gives at least 18 inches -LRB- semi -RRB- detailed seat in the Economy cubin this week , hope for such an industry standard , but it should be decided by the airlines , its main opponent Boeing says .
The dispute comes between the aircraft makers when there was a competition to sell large versions of the twin engine of the long distance error out of the possible recorded order after the 17-21 incident .
How the previous department of the aircraft has been created - especially if the design of mini jambo jets is being prepared keeping in mind the claims of seating 9 or 10 equal
Boeing says it ' s made 777  , which will keep 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 in one line in the Universal Department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will leave 350 people in 18 inches and take them to 9 seats.
Aircraft giants often strike business on technical matters through advertising in the business press .
Now, with Airbus 777 , Dubai Arshow is expected to dominate more than 100 orders, it is appealing to the public further.
Recently, it is being seen that whatever the beginning of the separation war has been, will you accept it together in a restaurant showing this to Finsero
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "Boeing is also presenting a long distance flight in narrow seats from regional turbo".
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way the plane sits is not changed.
According to statistics from the U . S . Health Department , during the 1970s , when Boeing 747 jumbo ne defined the modern long ki yatra ko , the average 40 - 49 year old American male weight of the century increased by 10 percent .
According to US Health Statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a 1950 seat concept when the new name Jet set ' s average periphery was narrow .
Airbus says that he has set up a research commission, which suggests improvement in the quality of an additional 53 per cent sleep in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the Airbus seat measurement data , saying it doesn ' t depend on the manufacturers ' decisions as to how airlines have a balance between rent and facilities . . .
It also says that research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of cabin.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Crawer said that . This in fact tells what is the need to do to provide flexibility to airlines and on those things which are trustworthy to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they benefit from.
They know better about their business than someone else.
For flyers it is about the elbow room, but for suppliers it is a fast issue that it can affect income.
Behind this dispute, the trade of at least  700 billion is estimated that the aircraft order competition is sufficient in the coming decades to tip the scales of US and European exports.
Reuters report said for the first time in July, what seat layout is actually an issue of fighting between new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that every seat has been 20 per cent of the workforce, in the new twin engine design, the leader of that section, compared to 365-seat Boeing 777-300 ar.
The claim of Boeing ' s performance depends on the comparison of 10 with 777 x of one root 9 with 777 design .
The comparison has now been utilised with 10 equivalent benefits in unit cost.
Kevin Keniston, Head of the Airbus Passenger Facility in Europe, says, "This is Boeing's doing to capture more seats to make their aircraft more competitive with our products.
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat per line cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the dancing layout, which can go along with cheap rent.
Cabin Internal Expert Mary Karbi, Founder and Editor Runway Girl Network said that the seat width of eighteen inches will be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of proposal 777
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for the airlines to select from the suppliers.
Jet vendors around the world also take care of this layout competition.
While resting more, all builders are also giving high density layouts for low cost airlines of jets and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10-equivalent A350 but it is not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus stressed on some of its jets in comprehensive cabin seats to need more cabin facility.
Without the support of another manufacturer of modern jets, there is no possibility of flying on a new industry standard, but it can distract from the wave of 777  sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can finish smoking .
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was capable of keeping rats safe from nicotine addiction for the whole life.
There is a need for further testing before man starts testing, which may take many years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market in today's time, But they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectively infects the liver cell, which after that starts making a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents them from getting summons of nicotine inside the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine given rats, which were later given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
Researchers say that but the rat which was not given the vaccine was "good", it was an indication that the nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be given doses at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, then it can be given to the children before the greed of trying cigarettes, so that they can be saved from nicotine addiction.
But possibly it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
He said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any pleasure from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to do a lot of research.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not be lifted due to the actual cause of the death of the tigress.
The Forest Department is giving a round-the-clock reply to the death of the tigress in the first place as natural.
On Thursday night, forest workers of Ramnagar Forest Division found a body of a tigress near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi Nallah.
With all the parts of the body of the tigress being safe, there was no scars of any wound or injury etc. on it.
In the presence of Forest Guard Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kaksha Nasim, SDO GS Karki, CTR veterinary doctor Bharat and Kotabagh veterinary doctor Hema Rathore post mortem of the body of the tigress was done on Friday.
According to sources, during the post-mortem, the internal body of the tigress is being told to be bad.
This did not detect the reasons for the actual death of the tigress.
On the death of the tigress, the departmental officer continued to respond.
Nevertheless, the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for hatsycological examination to confirm the poison.
Forest Guard Western Circuit Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tigress can be called natural.
No symptoms of poison etc. have been found from the body of the tigress.
Yet, with the search of the surrounding area, it is being sent to Bisra to confirm the poison.
Tripodi denies us being influenced by Obid.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by State Corpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi has denied refuting the policy of maritime leases on the request of his political guru AD Obide, the patron of former New South Wales, AD Obide, who had hidden interest in the government-controlled three lands. .
The Independent Commission (ICA) on Friday examined whether Mr. Obide has violated the circulars of the lease policy of lobbying with several state ministers, where two restaurants and cafe owned by Obide, without tender Renewed in August 2005 after the expiry of its time.
Lin Ashpole, after the evidence given by the former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, knew the hidden interests of Mr. Tripodi Mr. Obide.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the public tender for the lease.
The leasers were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, circular enterprises for leases, from which Obid earned  2.5 million annually, were renewed without lease tender.
Shri Tripodi, who was Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change at Mr . Obide ' s request , Mr . Tripodi had called for a change in the government lease policy .
Presented in a PhoneCollections in IAA in August and September 2007, Mr. Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dun, a senior official who came to the Fisheries Department of Obide after working in the Ministry of Ports.
Asked by Assistant Commissioner Anthony Healy Mr. Tripodi, " Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case"
"No, Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what I had discussed, but it was definitely not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say Israeli fighters attacked Syria .
Israeli fighter planes targeted Syria's port city Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News.
The officer did not tell what the motive was, but there was at least one motive.
The report of the Associated Press shows that the target was Russian missile SA-125.
Israel has missed air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice before this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can undergo authenticity test
The government is considering a "certification test" for foreign employees on 457 visas, as it aims to expand a tough action.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criteria for filling up unskilled posts in Australia or for preventing 457 experiments for delivery of family and friends in a covert manner.
A Government Discussion Paper was issued today, condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign employees, former Labor MP Maxine Maxen today said that it can provoke neighboring Australian countries.
He told the US Indian Institute today that "Foreigners are reaching the end of the queue and "Strong rhetoric about the job before the Australian people is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when the unions demanded a safe labor market. . "
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been protected and I would not be surprised if some people in the region saw the sound of that historical evidence.
The Discussion Paper outlines 12 measures which were earlier considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bovan.
Immigration Minister Brendan Okoner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met the officials about the smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the remaining are under consideration.
If "certification criteria" is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined in this regard, "Is the nomination true in such circumstances, in which the nominee, the owner of the person sponsoring the visa or the relative or individual partner is. "
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, because the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees, employed hundreds of people.
During this, 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after coming to a refugee boat on Christmas Iceland this week.
The person's distraught nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, an adult cousin has tied the stairs, which was on the same vessel.
Australian officials carried the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the US2 rail project.
Work by US2 indicates high speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baronas Cramer said that the project will be "UK" from this project.
Scotland Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
Once the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed link between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British Government, who was interacting with Scotland Transport, instructed US2 Limited to consider the possibility of improving rail capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
According to the Baronas Crammer: Our goal for US2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with US2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be well added due to US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elister Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Government of Scottish, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael to make a clear return to Scotland in the US2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to get huge economic benefits from high speed rail, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire UK High Speed Rail case."
Therefore, we are excited to work in partnership with the British Government so that we can examine the options for bringing high speed rail in Scotland, generating profit for all and completing the Glasgow-Adinburg line, whose Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the Ministers of the British Government next year and to take a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Rules will now be effective in Australia
In order to soften the equipment related regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will have to continue to shut down their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing the aircraft.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has opened the option to American Air Services Companies to change their procedures, so that during the important phases of the flight, passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment, provided they are in the "air" mode. Stay in
Passengers can do this only during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-book etc. while landing.
Australian Air Services Companies are considering this decision, according to which US Air Services Companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have any immediate plan to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment in important phases of the flight are still effective in Australia.
"Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulation to control the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft, the authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operating companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the security instructions given by the crew members. "
Virgin, who is already negotiating with FASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he will take further action on the instructions of the regulator Asked to take action.
The spokesman said, "We will welcome the review by FASA in the matter of allowing the use of electrical equipment, because we actually feel that it will provide better experience to the customers, because now we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) Our planes are in. "
uantas said that it will now follow the current rules.
It said, "According to our current policy, power equipment can not be used during flying and landing, and we do not have any immediate plan to change it."
CAAD decisions apply to American allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will definitely consider the CAAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US Air Services Company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Air Services Companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio degradation from mobile devices and amend their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and brief details to the passengers.
CAA said that "After verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow passengers to use light weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones on all heights."
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to shut down their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or in upper coaches while flying and landing.
The silver of the ponbrokers due to the difficulty of the middle class in Singapore
In the Bendemier Shopping Center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by giving her gold bangles, rings and swings to pay her daughter's school fees.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought the house, so all our money is stuck in it."
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 US dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of South-East Asia where domestic credit is increasing - ValueMax, where they are doing their transactions, became the third Ponshop to be listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
The mortgage of ornaments is not the only way to get cash - in case of Ms. Amirthalinga, 1300 Singapore dollars, but almost as cheap as the unsafe bank loan.
Normally, Ponbrokers in Singapore take interest of 17 per cent per annum, which is slightly more than 15.4 per cent presented by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender, which has a branch in the same shopping center.
However, ponbrokers have the advantage of not having the requirement of credit check or proof of salary, and can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are turning to ponshops due to rising cost of living by families and facing difficulties due to increase in domestic and consumer credit.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial calamity, and after cheaper credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low and middle income families are approaching Ponshop to meet their needs due to slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standards and Poor's, described the growing domestic gains mainly due to the growing mortgage, as a risk factor for the liability of Asian banks.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are worried about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged slightly from the technology recession this week.
On Thursday, data has shown a continuous export recession and consumer demand reduction.
In the Malaysian Bank, CIMB, economist Song Seng Woon said, "The decisive point is that with rising prices, [the income scale] people coming from middle to low class will try to increase their income in every possible way. Will do. "
Historically high values in gold values over the last two years have inspired people to mortgage individual properties as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family ornaments.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 pon outlets of City-State are gold.
People are saying, "Gold is feeling good, let's pledge the gold chain of the grandmother, and take back the next month."
Thailand's largest ponshop operator, Egyptian, has seen a 20 increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of mortgage that the outlet operator Valuemax in Bendimer and 15 others like it in Singapore are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where there are four shops, but also outside Asia. Planning to expand, Valuemax executive director Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it on the Singapore Stock Exchange using 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars received in the listing this week.
While some discount lenders have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that pledge is not only cheaper than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the loan.
They say, customers mortgage things that they already have, and redeeming personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
Social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weaker people use ponbrokers.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use Valuemax outlets, they mortgage gold bars or rollex watches, which can get cash payments up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
Ms. Yah says, "It includes rich people who need loans for a short time for business enterprise or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements."
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani, Wife Nita Ambani, is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her berth-day in Mumbai but not in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.
To attend this party, many Bollywood stars reached Jodhpur, and on the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur flight at Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his Wife poem Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously when such a big name will be included in the party, you can guess how big it will be.
Rescue package of  325 million for the health of Tazi
The Union Government has insisted that strict conditions are also attached to the  325 million rescue package for the health system of Tasmania, which will ensure that the state government can not ruin the fund.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking immediate action to resolve the current crisis due to the old population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases, and the boundaries of the system.
The financing for four years was decided after consultation with the Government of Tasmania with Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
Ms. Plibersek said today, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the special challenges faced by the state."
The package of 325 million dollars includes an alternative surgeries scheme of  31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the last collected cases.
This includes money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lonsestation, better care after leaving the hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health recording system in local hospitals.
Ms. Plibersek said, "These investments are in line with the best ways I have been told by leading physicians to improve the health system of Tasmania.
The Minister emphasized that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability rule.
The state will have to maintain the current financing level to obtain Commonwealth Money, and report every month where the additional fund is being spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effective and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that 325 million dollars will not mean much, "Until real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level."
Yet, he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he had first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
Mr. Wilkie said, "I hope the federal assistance package will prove to be very helpful in separating the state-run public health system from the crisis-stricken list.
According to the state government, these additional alternate procedures will mainly repeat the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Datton believes that today's announcement is "band-ed solution".
He told ABC TV, "We are here for this reason because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system."

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to build chemical weapons
The group monitoring on Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to create chemical weapons and poisonous gas war materials, while a fierce conflict emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic Agents are kept.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war that started almost three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organisation took place a day before the last date of November 1 .
Which the Hague-based organization had set up to destroy Dumscus or "ineffective" machinery used to add chemicals to all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and fill in war materials.
Mainly the completion of the earliest phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development, aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Dumscus by mid-2014.
Destroying the device means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus still has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
It is believed that Syria now has 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including Mustard Gas and Nerve Agent Surine.
The UK position Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when the conflict in Safira city increased on Thursday, about which experts believe that this is a chemical weapon production unit as well as a collection center.
The movement group, which has given details of the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children, are included.
On behalf of the government, it has been said that 29,954 President Bashar is a member of the army of Assad, 18,678 are fighters in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah is an extremist.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this conflict, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's army continued to fight the rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people have been casualties from both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war reflects the danger faced by the inspectors of chemical weapons, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short time frame.
The statement to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said that its team is "very satisfied" and has confirmed - and has seen all the declared important production and mixing equipment in Syria as destruction. "
It also said, "No inspection activity is being planned next."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 out of 23 centers declared by Dumscus.
Inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been sacrificed and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
In a comment issued by OPCW, Director General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmat Uzumku said, "I salute the determination and courage displayed by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission done by this organization so far. .
This civil war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, which came out of Shia Islam, besides members of the Italy cult, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory Chief Rami Abdur Rahman said that there was a powerful explosion in the Air Defence Center in Latakia, the coastal region of Syria on Wednesday.
He said that the reason for this explosion is not known yet.
Police have recovered photo copies of fake registry, fake stamps, laptops and fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar Police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused registrar, along with the clerk and recordkeeper Balbir Singh of the office, used to get papers out of the records of empty and old land and after that they bought new stamp papers and prepared fake registry on them.
Not only that, after disappearing the real registry, they used to offer fake registry records.
After this the accused used to sell the land on fake papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land remained a push account of the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the fake registry kept a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the fake registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused said in the interrogation that they have so far prepared fake registrars of 150.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft are also registered against gangster Rajiv.
Indignation on the conviction of a bomb blast in Bali
In 2002, the relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the bomb blast, expressing resentment over the punishment given to the conspirator of the bomb blast, said that Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran away as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building explosive devices used in the bomb blast.
If parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, in which 202 people were killed, in which 88 Australians were involved, and many people were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the person who is called the infamous "destructive person" as the master person who made the bomb was the death penalty.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of the woman living in Perth, June Cortein, who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtine told AAP, "He should be put in front of the firing team."
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
Absolutely after 11 o'clock on October 12, 2002, after the explosion of a bomb loaded in the van standing outside the entire club, the nomination of this club was erased.
Peter Hughes was in the pedigree bar at the time of the explosion just 20 seconds before the bagpack filled with explosive material by suicide bombers.
As a result of the incident of the bomb blast, he went to a month-long coma and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have been punished for the same punishment which was awarded to three other members of the Jemmah Islamic terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Sea - who were awarded death penalty four years ago.
In fact, this person should be punished before someone else.
There is no reason to keep her alive, see, keeping her alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get 20 years of punishment.
Patek is the last person to be punished by Bali bomb explosives.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but ultimately in January 2011, he was arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the US Army had killed former al-aeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to re-establish contacts between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al aeda.
Ms. Courtine says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, it is not really sad to hurt so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtine said, "This year many tears will flow."
Still Patek can appeal against his penalties.
FA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but cell can not call from phone)
Aircrafts will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from entering the gate to descending from the gate - but they will not be able to talk to their cellphone - this is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show how their aircraft, new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training booklets and devices of their crew members to showcase the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already obtained schemes from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetW are among the airlines who have already submitted the plans.
In a statement, the FAA said, "Based on the status of the plan, we can quickly approve the extensive use of electronic device.
At the moment, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to not turn them on until they reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and allow them by the captain.
Passengers are expected to shut down their device again when the aircraft lands, and do not turn it on until the aircraft is completely landed.
The FAA said, Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruptions can allow their passengers to fly by plane, land and use the device at the time of taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at a higher altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
The President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, Laura Gladding welcomed these changes.
Gladding said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airlines companies to do so - then it will be a victory for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we are bored to feel like "Hall Monitors".
The agency said that but surfing by connecting the internet at less than 10,000 feet, email exchange, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be restricted.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So, there will still be no conversation with friends, an online scable game, the famous incident related to it is that when actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the airport at the gate in 2011, and by them The American airlines had dropped them off the plane when they refused to close the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected because due to their bounce, the other person will be worried about the injury in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
The Federal Communication Commission has the regulatory authority regarding phone calls, not with FAA.
FAA can lift restrictions on some electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenken of the National Transport Security Board, who is a national transport security expert of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered as risks.
Rosenkar said, "Sail phones are really serious issues, but not because they can potentially interfere in navigation-related devices, but also because they are in the air, due to interference in cell phone towers Can do. "
Industry Advisory Committee constituted by FAA to examine the issue last month has recommended that the Government should allow greater use of individual electronic devices.
The FAA has been increasingly under pressure in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics like Sen. Claire McCascalk, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
It is becoming more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is omnipresent.
Some studies also indicate that about three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
The FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when FM radio and high-tech gadgets of the time received reports of disruption of navigation and communication equipment.
New airlines companies are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic intervention.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at the cruising height for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interruption.
Huartta said that most airline companies should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Electronic devices of today's time emit very little power radio transmission compared to the previous generation's electronic device.
For example, there is a nominal transmission during e-readers, page reversal.
But transmissions are dominant when downloading or sending data through the device.
Amazon.com has also been among those who favor the reduction of restrictions on the use of the device by the passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Air Passenger Association said that he believes that the disruption of the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of interference by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot be allowed to shut down the device when the aircraft is launched in less visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and described them as common knowledge of people travelling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Do, CEO, US Travel Association said, We are happy that FAA has recognized that travellers travelling with pleasure are not incompatible with safety and security.

Birds were left back in the jungle by air transport for protection from North Sea Rig
The bird found on the North Sea Oil Rig has been left in the jungle back from the coast by air transport.
The bird named Water Rail was sent to Eberdeen by the helicopter before Scottish SPA was restored to his Eloa-based rescue center.
Central Manager Colin Seden said: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird of northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds above the northern sea."
It seems the bird was tired and he took refuge in the oil rig.
He further said: "It was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help."
Before leaving, the water rail became healthy and healthy.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain
The Business for Britain was launched in April and it was pledged to bring business together and determine what changes the UK's job and prosperity makers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they had about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders who are representatives of UKs business size, regions and locations.
The findings of this survey can be astonishing for many people.
We found that a large part of the businessmen now want to export outside Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member countries are becoming dysfunctional.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not to engage in the long-term and difficult process of reforming the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views about specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
General dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels exceeds the benefits of being part of Europe's trading sector - even a large businessman who traditionally favored European companies, 40 percent agreed on this.
Finally, and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants the UK to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This conclusion, which was observed in the levels of leading business groups, showed that businessmen are motivating a "meaning change", which will give back its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - the issue of treaty change and a better deal for the UK changed the vote turnout by 16 percent in favor of sustaining the EU in the ballot box.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: The survey is that UK businessmen support their plan to negotiate on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also demonstrated that businessmen expect to re-convert and make a meaningful change in favour of the UK to present power balance.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and very fast it is becoming mandatory, because Eurozone is moving forward towards a bound economy and fiscal federation.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the outcome of our survey shows that it means a new focused focus on business and a fundamental change in the regulations of Brussels.

Prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, two employees of YMCA accused of sexual offenses, heard by the Royal Commission
Two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offences before being charged against Caringbah Child Career Employee Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in his statement before the Commission, he said that it has never "a case of child sexual harassment" in its organization, it was told to the commission.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which YMCA Carringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual offenses against children who lived in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told the advocate Gayle Fernes, who assisted the Commission, that he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that an external investigation of YMCA has been conducted and that YMCA has been found to be at the forefront of child safety is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community uality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is accompanied by YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that the management including me has failed due to the appointment of Lord himself, and failed to ensure that the employees are clearly aware of their obligations regarding informing of child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offenses with 12 children during a two-year tenure at YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not report the violation of child safety by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the violation, gave to the evidence in which the Lord spent time alone with the children, privately babesiting them, putting them in the lap, telling them that he loves them and let them play on their mobile phones Includes.
Daniel Ockwell, who was under the supervision of the Lord, had said for child safety training, as he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the YMCA, who supervised the Lord, was a "very bullying child service manager", Jacoby Barnat, and it was difficult to get most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that he was not comfortable giving information above his manager.
He said that, but his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his views to the YMCA NSW Mandal that, "Jonathan Lord was about not giving the text to the organization from the incident."
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the Secrecy Agreement by the employees immediately after the charges came to light was made by the YMCA's child service manager, Liam Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the combination of evidence, but it was not "excited" and executed correctly.
Stephen Smallbon, Special Professor for Child Sexual Harassment at Griffith University, said that during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, YMCA NSW was not a safe organization.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the appointment, monitoring, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to be the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of a return.
In an interview taken at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
Restricting most of his comments to the role of representatives of foreign affairs and the Middle East Peacekeepers after a decade after leaving office in June 2007, Mr. Blair avoided discussing British politics to a great extent.
When asked if he would like to come back to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying, "Yes, surely, but this is not possible, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts performing horse for the best horse of the year was gathered in Cardiff, they knew that this would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even in school and a few months away from taking his first step, the young child and his pet Shetland's Tattu Toffee easily completed three phases and won the top prize - he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the Annual Competition organized by the Suneback Equestation Centre at Rudri near Cardif, it was highly appreciated for the display, behaviour and style of the unseparable pair - which is the length of Sk itself.
In front of men and women wearing a beautiful baller hat, she shook her flat hat on the angle and put her two-year-old toffee around the ring.
Decisioners praised Fenton for their natural skills to control which is far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given a gift in the last March as a gift on Toffee's third birthday, and he has practiced with this tattoo of Shetland daily since then.
His 30-year-old Ma Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee are a splendid pair."
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and Roset.
This was the second opportunity when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy with his victory.
The most different in this theater, he felt so amazing to everyone that he wanted to photograph with him.
This young child from Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Wales is running on the footprints of his Anti Sharon Howles, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Smt. Howells said: The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everybody was celebrating and clapping.
He was running on the sand in the whole theater, and despite being so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens whom he takes care of.
The way he started, he will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am sure he will perform very well.
An annual horse exhibition spokesman said: "Fenton's age is only three years, but he comes to control his stitch."
They are very good pairs.
The decision makers gave marks in view of the way Fenton and Toffee performed and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure Fenton's beloved clothes have helped him, he looked really very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be "renovated"
A Chinese newspaper who had made an appeal on the homepage to leave a reporter guilty of defamation, will be restored, a press regulator said this.
Guangzhou's newspaper New Express gave a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongjou.
But after that, Mr. Chen accepted on television that he had taken a bribe to write concocted news about the state's partially owned company.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to undergo complete improvement.
"The order of reform came from the Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary inquiry showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published many false reports about the listed company umloyon in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "Editorial management of New Express was disorganized."
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative penalty by canceling the license of the reporter of "Chen Yongjou".
It had instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the people responsible for it in the New Express and to revise the leadership team of the New Express immediately.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles in the New Express, which blame financial irregularities in a construction-subsidisation company named umloyn.
After his denial, his newspaper published a two-page appeal for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to the state television and accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster CCTV that "In this case, I have damaged the ability to win the confidence of the entire news media industry as well as the confidence of the people."
I did this mainly because I had the greed of money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a page apology, which said that it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have accepted the televised faults.
Experts say that from time to time, forcible accusations are made, despite this, in the latter half of this year, a law prohibited the authorities from blaming any person for blaming themselves.

US-Mexico Drug Tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between USA and Mexico has been found, which has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The US officers have described the four-feet three-feet tunnel as one of the most complicated secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is equivalent to the curved length of about six football pitches, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Digo, USA.
This area is full of godowns, which makes it easier to hide the truck being filled with drugs.

British police sent extradition notice to Assange
The British Police sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today, who has taken shelter in the embassy of Ecuador in London and has requested for shelter.
Scotland Yard said that he has sent a "dedication notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he will have to appear in the police station, and also said that if he fails to do so, he will be responsible for arresting himself. .
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden due to sexual offenses, as well as his options under British law ended at the time when the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand him over to the US, fearing that he had requested refuge in the embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political shelter.
A spokesman said that Scotland Yard has sent a surrender notice to the 40-year-old Assange, for which he needed to be present at the police station on the date and time chosen by us.
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on giving police notice.
Assange fears that due to the issuance of more than 250,000 US political cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, United States will be extradited from Sweden to face possible detective charges.

Tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial position
The Department of Finance has calculated the CGT measures in a provisional manner, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osbourne, who presented stamp duty at the rate of 7 for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the Budget 2012 and for persons who give priority to householding in a company rather than a separate person.
The stamp duty obtained from residential properties in Westminster and cities of Kensington and Chelesa in the year 201213 was 708 million pounds, which is already higher than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a proper tax on high-value property, which is that the old council There is no relation with the effect of the tax system. "
He added , But this step kept silent on buying property in London for some foreign investors and could reluctant to sell the existing owners .
The top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market, which extends from Phulham to Wimbledon, in terms of value in Price Property, Wealthy South-West London, increased by 11. 8 percent last year.
According to Savilles' research, the prices of central London continued to grow by 5.6 per cent every year, but the growing "increasing" seemed to be slightly lower than the domestic market, as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) The surge is being seen.
Scientists have highlighted further on the subject that there is a relationship between the movements of the dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while restless dogs move their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of tail and can react to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Georgia Vellartigra, a neuroscientist from the University of Trainto, said: "In men, it is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the stimulus which produces positive or negative feelings. . "
Here we have also tried to see it in other species.
He said that in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To know more about how dogs react to unilateral tail movement by other dogs, researchers kept an eye on animals watching movies of other dogs.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We presented dogs with dogs' films - in the shadow-film to deal with other issues in realistic edition or confusing, and we could see the movement of the tail and the tail Can present more left or right. "
When the animals saw an emotional dog moving their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they remained completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail changing the direction and mainly turning to the left (from the point of view of the dog), his heart beat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experiences that they should be worried about what action and not on whom.
He said: "If you have met many times with other dogs, and if they move their tail continuously on one side, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, You respond on the basis of the same experience. "
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of animals to the owners, veterinarians and trainers.
Fellow of the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, John Breadshaw, a dog behavior expert, told that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for the dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when the dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads on the right when they look at the happy dog.
In other research in the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "Unlike the Italian study - when the robot dog tail was moved to the left than the right, the dogs were more likely to reach near it rather than being restless."
He said that this difference was because in various studies, dogs did not understand animals or robot dogs completely in films.
He clarified that it can help dogs study the way they respond to real dogs.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and dogs are not exceptions in this case, he said. "
However, considering the easy way their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.

Pope Francis to announce First Cardinal Name in February
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church consists of the highest class priests, whose position is below the pope, and they select the pope, hence Francis will represent the first group of individuals who will ultimately assist in choosing their successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals right now.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the Pope - it falls into the 120 Cardinal Electoral Group.
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the celebration of the promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be organized, which is called Pope-Sabbha.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has decided to tell his decision to organize the Pope-Constitution of February so that it is easy to plan other meetings of cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February there was a possibility of a reduction in the number of cardinal electors.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, so many cardinals, and according to their wishes, declare the names of cardinals above 80 years of age.
Valero said that the next year's Pope-Sabha will be important, as it will be the first Pope-Sabha after the election of Francis in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see whether new popes are nominated for restoring the balance, cardinals from the rest of the world."
South America has forty percent Roman Catholics, but their number in cardinals is very low.
Cardinals Council by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church, will also be the first cardinals to be selected after the formation.
Prior to this, the pope used to decide all the things automatically.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help himself."
He said that it is possible that Francis seeks advice from cardinals.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is completely new.
Valero said that usually the pope gives the post of cardinal to the bishops of large places, but Francis was completely surprised - so we do not know whose name they will declare.
GM calls back pickup trucks in the US to correct the seatback
According to an information on behalf of US Auto Security Regulators on Friday, about 19,000 trucks have been recalled to correct a shortfall in the General Motors Company, its new 2014 Shevarley Silverado and GMC Sira Pickup Trucks.
There may be a reduction in the front seat rotating system in some trucks.
As a result, the Union failed to comply with the Auto Security Standards on Seatback, Head Restraint.
According to an information put on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, "If the vehicle is trapped behind, then it is possible that the head restraint can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The trucks of GM started being sent in June and showcases the most important vehicle launch for the top US automaker after the insolvency renewal of 2009.
GM had told the truck owners about this defect in the latter half of October.
Due to the 16-day government ban on NSTMA, which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October, the Swami could not review the notification.
The GM said on Friday that the sale of Silverado and Sera trucks, which were redesigned for the year 2014 Model Year, had increased by 20 in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 silver radio and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, GM's share in the New York Stock Exchange was 1.4 percent bounce.
Obama's voters scream of disappointment
I voted Obama twice in the expectation of a change
He says that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to the policy of blockade of GOP
Obstruction policy can not excuse the problems of Obamacare website, drone attacks
Obama ' s 2008 campaign reminds us of what could have happened .
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I think it will encourage me during the second year's medical school's depression and will awaken the ray of hope in me.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is the memorial of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get wiped out with the pamphlets of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics had inspired millions of people and speeches could stop your breath. .
Elections proved unilateral, and news speakers had taken a break to show the historical significance of that time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they received.
A team of young visionary persons was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
During the formation of Obama's President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a tragic memory of lost opportunities.
There was actually a change after I voted for the first time.
Simply say, none of these could have imagined.
I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Do not ask, until Osama bin Laden is killed."
Further, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented many of our efforts to move forward: immigration reform, public options for healthcare, shutting down of Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But innumerable times in which I took the side of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The Republican opposition policy is not an answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is there an answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the National Security Agency's collection of data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens, nor can it answer the prosecution of people who highlight the wrongdoings of the government.
It can not tell the reason for the killing of American citizen Anwar L. Awlaki without any trial, nor the public funds and expenditure limits reduced during the President's camp.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that efforts by the White House to silence the media have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it cannot pretend to have failed to design a simple website even after three years of signing in the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether I had expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have assumed that the governance system could refute the political campaign that would bring it forward.
It is evident that the elected office is not a prerequisite route because the opposition political parties and random incidents such as the Newtown murder case will shape our public discussion.
However, all the examples I have given above appear to have been mostly chosen by the administration.
This thing troubles you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not seem like deciding his policies or position.
I felt that another term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes about which we have been listening for a long time.
However, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I miss the promises they have disappeared.
In this week, a part of the book was reading, describing how Clinton had suffered a huge loss due to Obama in Pennsylvania Primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they need to return to the tracks, and need to remain integrity on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are from Nathaniel Moris.
Clive Pamar claims that PM Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral holiday scheme is a conflict
Billionaire MP Clive Pamar has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral holiday scheme is a struggle because his daughters can be pregnant, and can take advantage of it.

But Mr. Pamar has claimed that only the interests of the ministers can be conflicted, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from policies.
Mr. Pamar said, "In the case of given ancestral leave, he can have an important interest in conflict, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, then they will have a direct interest that they should get a holiday or not.

Tony Aut's daughter Francis and Bridget
Should the result of the election come two months after our voting
He said, "We should have a better system."
Why can not we have a system in which we fill our details on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
Mr. Pamar also criticized the use of pencil to mark ballot papers.
That's because, because if a person does not like him, then the wives can erase him
It seems absolutely absurd to use pencil in today's era.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint discussion paper with New ealand.
59-year-old Mr. Pamar said that his policies include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he will take his new work "very seriously".
Public office is for public service.
He said, "We do not want any other award other than the prize of history that we can serve the community at this important time."
The plaintiffs had to face problems.
Addressing the gathering organized on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong displeasure over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said that the rapidly growing attacks on advocates and their families prove that the criminals have become unaware.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the security of the common man can be easily estimated.
RBI suspended two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Department of Exchange of Foreign Exchange (DEA), which received information from two persons obtained from the case, is another indication that the global scrutiny by the regulators in the suspicious manipulation of the currency market is progressing at a fast pace.

Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation is in progress in this matter, and we are fully cooperating with CA and other regulators."
Last month, experts from the case had said that the RBI was sent to the former trader and sent the records of emails and quick messages received from them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority.
This trader, Richard User, had left RBS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current post of European Head of Forex Spot Trading in JP Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, chief of European spot trading in City, went on leave last week, while former senior currency trader in Barclase and BSF was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
People with the case said that Mr. User's uick Message Group includes barclage and citigroup bankers.
The BSF said that after being told by the Swiss regulator, Finma that she is investigating the suspicious manipulation of the foreign currency market in many Swiss banks, this week she has taken action against some of her employees.
At the global level, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competitive Authority, VECO, CA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hague Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations of misconduct in the currency market for their favorable fluctuations. Are there.
People acquainted with the matter said that USB, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Credit Suisse have also examined internal investigations, or have received requests for information from the regulators.
Banks are closely examining quick messages and emails for many years in search of clues for any wrong activity.
News about Investigation has created a stir in traders in the sector who have been one of the most profitable trading entities in the Investment Banks trading entity for the past several years, but are facing a challenge this year, as there has been a reduction in opportunities for bookmakers due to low fluctuations in the currency.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate a very huge and excessive liquid foreign exchange exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that it is true.
Senior trader said that despite the huge magnitude of foreign exchange purchase and sale, the fission of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own platform by the banks means that "you are at a little lower ticket price Can start affecting the market. "
This news came on the same day, on the day Credit Suisse announced the departure of the trader from his Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London this week, which had lost about 6 million at the end of last year.

It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money for life is one of the biggest needs, but it is not in our interest to accept it all.
We celebrate Dhanteras to Krishna Triodshi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped by the god of wealth Kuber and death god Yamraj.
Wealth has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good and bad.
Good is our feeling of wealth.
The wealth which is used for the welfare of humanity can not be more valuable than anything else, but the money that caused the ego has no meaning.
We should earn money with a sacred purpose and spend only for a sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some part of it should also have a sense of spending on the society, but the tendency of collecting unaccounted or yen-ken-provoked money destroys our discretion, personality.
The sense of donation should always be in the mind.
A portion of the money given by you can also be the basis of someone's life.
Many people in the society are living in a terrible absence, we all should think for them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the myths of life.
Everyone wishes for wealth and fame and according to their well-being, they also get wealth and fame.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is associated.
No matter how rich a criminal becomes, he can neither consume it properly nor can anyone use it.
If someone else has money then do not envy him.
The true wealthy is the one who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of money.
There can be no more use of money than creating employment for others.
One more thing, money is not only in the form of currency.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try that you become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continues the policy of shutting down the sale of kerosene through ration, then half a dozen states will not get kerosene on these shops.
In the states where kerosene sales are to be stopped, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand are included.
Apart from these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states of the North-East are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, on two basis, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states.
The first basis is that electricity connections are being built rapidly in rural areas.
The second basis is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural families have been given LPG connections.
Petroleum Ministry has prepared a lot about this.
PDS kerosene sales in Delhi have already been closed since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota of Punjab was reduced from 2.72 lakh kilo liters to one lakh kilo liters.
In the allocation of Uttarakhand, 70 percent of Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this reduction, there is no news of the shortage of kerosene from these states.
The Ministry is convinced that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
There is a difference of Rs 37 in the price of PDS kerosene and diesel.
This encourages those who adulterate.
In the states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full cost in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.

I call upon the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be decided in the country.
Which party did what
If there is a comparative result, then the question will not come in front of the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government is formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food for two times.
But when the Congress or its support government was formed, the poor man was not lucky to eat.
Not a single Congress leader, a single UPA leader, is responding to what he did in nine and a half years.
Media people of our country can not even reach them.
The Congress has become egoistic.
They do not even answer the media.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal and said, "The next day Modi is being asked questions. In 2014, when the public will bless the BJP, then every year he will present his account of work in front of the public.
In democracy, there should be no ruler in Delhi, a servant should sit.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends keep leaving balloons on the day.
Congress friends, we have examined 10 months ago.
In democracy, the public only takes the test.

He said that as far as development work is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development work.
The way Chandigarh is developing or going to be, these people can not even think of it.
In the Cabinet meeting, greetings were exchanged between the two.
When the meeting ended, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for counter-attack on Narendra Modi in Chintan camp.
He also said about his speech that there is no other sense in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be fought firmly.
There was also a feeling on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to honor the workers in the Chintan camp and save them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to dismiss from the cabinet to keep his point.
By the way, after the emergence of opinion in the Chintan camp, there is a fresh idea of setting up workers in government posts.
In the camp, State JD (U) President Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the announcement of the nomination of workers in the 20-point committees will be announced soon.
His signal was also that the list is almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list from his level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of legislators and MPs has been taken in the list.
If needed, the list will be largely reshuffled to give place to the old and committed workers.
The common allegation of MLAs and MPs is that the opinion of those people was not taken in the list of nominations.
The names of people who came after a long time from other parties have been recorded in the list, while many important activists active since the days of Samata Party have remained neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
In such personalities, a name also comes from Self-Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was third in five siblings.
Five children of the family include Raniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumathi.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started financially helping the house in childhood.
At this time, he used to set up a bhajia shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he reached Eden city of Yemen with a ship named Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting jobs abroad.
But there was something else in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, they returned to the country.
In 1955, by placing 500 rupees in pocket, luck reached Mumbai.
And his business journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling their sultanate.
Like father today, the names of these two brothers are also among international level businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, unlike Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), during the stay of Atal Vihari Bajpai's PM, there was a round when no advertisement was issued by the government for two consecutive years (2001-2002) Patel. Gaya.
Keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meter high statue of 'Statue of Unity' in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "There was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement to Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crores for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When asked about this difference from Manish Tewari, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of expenditure on advertisement.
Because the price of advertisement depends on many things, which include things like advertising size or advertising rates for that year.
The real thing is that it reveals our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Wale delivers free healthcare to the rural areas of Cameron
Well and his team see hundreds of patients every weekend .
There is not much physician in West African countries , there is only one physician for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or for anyone in the top 10 to make CNN year hero.
The winner will receive  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Wale had seen his sick father coming to his senses and going to the hospital unconscious, which was not properly facilitated to help him.
Jamel Well, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near Cameron's capital Yonde.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased, which spread to his brain, and he created anemia, which affected his remaining life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameron.
If we had money, then we would take our father out of the cameraon.
Instead, Well continued to revolve around the crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and continued to get whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "This is not easy."
You leave the house at 5 o'clock in the morning with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait and die in the mouth of death.
Since the death of Well's father in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameron has only one doctor for every 5000 people.
If compared, then there is a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameron can not afford it.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is from the private sector.
Well says, "Their only problem is poverty.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well took a firm resolve to resolve this.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have conducted 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Central Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organization Escovime, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tied medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to move forward by pushing the vehicle more than once from the rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they actually get the honour of heroes: feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation offered by the community.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a cause of celebration, and Well - with its big smile and endless energy - it involves happiness and happiness.
The next morning his team starts meeting with hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in every trip."
They come from the village about 60 km away, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - this document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually done at school buildings, town halls or at home, after the process, the patient goes to the recovery place, and makes a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes in the operation room and sanitizing devices, and Well and his volunteers work on Sunday morning.
This is a complicated speed, but the musicians of the village generally help in motivating the party.
Well said, "They keep us awake and play drums all night to continue their work."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group comprising Cameron physicians and foreign medical students has undergone 700 free surgery last year and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
One person said that due to free hernia surgery, she will be able to go back to work.
The person said, "This will change the future of my family and my family."
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Well also works in private medical clinics around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which financing 60 of his non-profit work, the rest is completed by personal donations.
A second year medical student of Draxel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Well Group, Katie O'Mally said, "I do not know when they sleep.
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
This is an experimental opportunity for medical and nursing students like O'Mally who come from United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, which they can never get in their country.
O'Mally said, "In the surgeon we help in catching tools for Dr. Well or cleaning blood stains, we have been able to gain experimental experience in them."
As a second year medical student in the US, you will never get the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend their money to reach the cameraon, and they often come with the medical supplies of donations.
But after reaching Yonde, they come to stay, and take the cost of instructions.
O'Mally says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, the burden of almost the same work is not difficult.
Helping others live happily, fulfilling the promises made to their father, these are things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I am very happy to do this work.
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, reduce their pain.
View the website of Escovime and find out how to help.

Speaking through a video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "There is no question in this that the President, me, and other people in the government really knew about some things happening with the automatic pilot, because look back, The difficult years of World War II and the cold war, and then, of course, in 911, it had the potential. "
He has become the first high-ranking member of the US Government, who has acknowledged that US espionage has crossed its limits, but has stressed that no one's rights have been misused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone a long way inappropriately."
And the President is determined to make it clear to the people and is still making a thorough review so that no person is misused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that however, the NSA was working for a good endeavour and its monitoring work has saved many lives.
He further said: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves."
There is radical insurgency in the world, which is committed to killing people and killing them and attacking governments.
So what is the problem if you are able to stop it before it occurs
We have actually saved the aircraft from falling, destroying buildings, and killing people because we have been able to know about others' plans in advance.
During this, on Thursday, the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee of European Affairs said that to assist in resolving the so-called US espionage overseas concerns, US manufacturers will go to Europe, and European countries will try to explain the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and due to frustration over the monitoring by the National Security Agency, they are worried about the threats of prevention of participation by them in anti-terrorist organizations.
Marfi, president of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee of European Affairs, was elected for the first time of the Democratic Party, said in an interview with Washington, "It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that European countries are with us in terms of our anti-terrorist efforts. .
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA programme.
The reports of NSA recording millions of European phone conversations have brought bitterness in relation to some US partner countries, although the agency chief said that these reports are not completely correct, and NATO reflects the misunderstanding of metadata shared with the United Nations collected by allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden show that NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Agenda Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the incident of espionage on allies and said that it is common for both sides to do so.
In the midst of the ruckus, Murphy said that his office is arranging for a Congress visit which is likely to happen this year, and he hoped that the delegation will include members of both the parties and both the Chambers.
The names of other participants will be issued in the coming days.
He said that work is still being done on the travel program.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he said that some "inapplicable relations" have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will have to be honest with their people, their espionage programs used for years.
Murphy said, "Though we can amend our surveillance program to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying."
During this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will address malice from the US Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran to the US Monitoring Activities.

Some councilors of the Left Front, including the CPI (M), have also taken the flag of Trinamool.

Mr. Rai also claims that all agree with the blueprint for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including Congress, CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
The qualified leaders of any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
Prior to the elections of the five municipalities to be held on November 22, due to the change of Congress councilors in the Saithia municipality, the capture of Trinamool on the municipal board is being considered as important in political circles.
Earlier, in the Left Front-ruled Haldia and Nadia, there is an example of Trinamool's occupation of the Congress-ruled municipal board.
In the districts, when the Trinamool is occupied by the party's change on the municipal board, those who join the party are welcomed in the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.

They say that those who break away from any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
They claim that the faith of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, which is the result that people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party CPI (M) says that the lower level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress fearing terror.
The CPI (M) is considering the change in the board of elected local bodies as a trauma on democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is imperative to question the justification for making a change in the matter of power.
