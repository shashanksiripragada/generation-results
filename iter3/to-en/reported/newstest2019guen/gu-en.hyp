At the international level, China seeks to make the UN international currency at the level of euro, yen and pounds, including dollars
Given the prospects of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupee and rubble.
International Desk: Today, India and Russia have agreed on the S-400 Defence Missile System between US banners.

The sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupee and rubble keeping in view the prospects of economic sanctions from the US.
USA imposed ban on China's deal
It may be mentioned that in September, Russia had dealt with S-400 missiles with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to ban China.
Due to this restriction, the purchase of Missile by using US Dollars for China was almost impossible.
However, during the last few years, China has tried to raise its Currency Youn as an international currency compared to the dollar.
After this initiative, China has been consistently making efforts at international level to make the UN an international currency equivalent to Euro, Yen and Pound, including dollars.
On the other hand, China has one of the largest reserves of US Dollars in international trade.
China wants to make Yeon an international currency
The Mega Defence Deal of USD 5 billion can be placed on the US Customs Prohibition (CAATSA).
Last month, the US had imposed a ban on buying S-400 missile systems on China.
India and Russia had started establishing an alternate mechanism for this deal from that time.
Earlier, due to US sanctions on the INS Chakrani repair deal, which was leased from Russia, India and Russia had agreed on an estimated 2 billion dollar deal.
The Economic Analyst claims that in order to come out of this situation, India should use the Rupee-Rouble Exchange as an international currency to execute deals.
It is worth mentioning that all the defence deals with Russia so far have been made through dollars.
Why was America's Cutsa Law
President Donald Trump in August, in view of the Russian modern Defence Missile System, approved the CATSA Act to prevent Russia from acting against US interests internationally.
It may be noted that the US Act has been prepared keeping in view the activities of Russia.
This includes confession on Russian side by attacking Ukraine in 2014, confession on Cremia, participation in the Syrian Home War and participation in the 2016 US Presidential election.

Was he shocked by reading the scriptures
How can a descriptive language of Sultan Mahmud Ghazni of Gajni, a hymn of Somnath Temple and a composer for the common Indian be composed
In fact, the research by Professor Shanti Pandey, the historian of the University of Delhi, has shown that the Rajbhasha of Gazni was a Sanskrit.
Recently, Shri Somnath Trust felicitated Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit, Sanskrit was only a folklore that it was natural to have such a simple question as the language of the so-called high-level leaders.
Remembering Pandit Gulam Dastakhdar, Mumbai.
The 87-year-old pundits who spoke in simple Sanskrit that even a rickshaw driver can understand are still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the holy uran before publication.
The word sacred uran is reflected in his vision.
u Ran i. e.
He is among the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country, who have not only studied in the school of Solapur themselves but have also worn the fingers today.
However, Panditji, who spent his ease of living, does not seek to describe himself as a pundit of Sanskrit in the US or other countries for his marketing.
The Princess of Thailand is a scholar of Sanskrit.
Sanskrit teaches himself there.
To learn Sanskrit from the United States, eager ones have to go to Bon University in Germany.
In India not only in Banaras Hindu University but in most of the universities Ph . . . great association of Sanskrit is also written in the language of that state .
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati but it should be remembered that education was imparted only through Sanskrit medium in the universities of Taxila and Nalanda.
Practice of Sanskrit in Afghan, says PRASHANTA PANDE that the rude language of the Sultan of Gazni was not only Sanskrit but also the coins of his finances were also mentioned in Sanskrit.
Panda noted that these coins were recognised in Sanskrit on Mohammad Suratran and that Panini was a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan, the creator of Sanskrit discourse.
Pandit Nehru has said that in the philosophy of Maru Hindi, the power and sustainable power of Sanskrit language has descended from Afghan and Pushtu language Sanskrit.
Today, everyone accepts that not only Indian languages but Indo-European languages have also emerged from Sanskrit.
One more surprising fact is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the Chief Guest of the Constitution, and other members of the Muslim and South Indian Constituent Assembly had proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
On 13 September 1949 in English against Hindi the national language was discussed in the constituent assembly when among those proposing to Sanskrit the national language were Vice Foreign Minister Dr . B . . . Keskar and Nazaruddin Ahmed .
Considering that day's discussion and the report published in the National Herald of September 11, 1949, the prospect of arbitration of Sanskrit language is estimated.
Even today, we have not been able to decide any national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit and Urdu, occupy the position of an official language in our Constitution, and not a national language.
As per the population calculations of 2011, Sanskrit has now been the mother tongue of only 24,821 people of the country.
Prime Minister Nehru also spoke with great respect about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the context of his scripture, he has reversed that Sanskrit and detailed the importance that the world scholars have given to Sanskrit: In the Saal of 1874, Sir Williams Jones said, "How old is Sanskrit language, Lord knows, his creation is wonderful.
It is fuller than Greek, wideer than Latin and more than that.
Nehru noted: "I don't know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language i. e.
Today, as a Sanskrit language prayer or as a Member of Parliament, Union Minister Smriti ubin Irani has been the only language to swear.
We must save the years of Sanskrit and revive it and make it a folk language.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived, then Sanskrit is still a living language.
Instead of demonstrating or constructive efforts to make it a democracies, it is Ganayat.
